Vi,2001 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Vietnam (trafficked from),American Samoa (slavery location),"My name is Vi. And I am 28 years old. I arrived in American Samoa on July 22, 1999. Two other groups of Vietnamese workers had been brought to this island before us. When I signed the contract to Tour Company 12, they told me that I would go to the US and its Deputy Director promised that I would get paid $408 a month. I had to borrow $4000 to pay to Company 12 and another $2000 to pay the company official in charge of recruitment. We were taken to American Samoa and not the US. As soon as we landed our passports were confiscated. At a Daewoosa shop, I had to work from 7am to 2am and sometimes to 7am the next day, and also on Saturdays and Sundays, without pay. We had no money to buy food, amenities or soap. We had to pay $200 per month for room and board, which they should have provided according to the contract. Meals at Daewoosa consisted of a few cabbage leaves, and potatoes cooked with a lot of water. Those who were at the head of the line could get some cabbage and potato, latecomers got only water. Hungry, we planted some vegetables to supplement our meals, but Mr. Lee, President of Daewoosa, destroyed our garden. Undernourished, I lost 35 pounds within one year and weighed only 78 pounds. Working and living conditions at Daewoosa were very suffocating. There was no air ventilation. Workers slept right next to each other. The temperature in the rooms sometime went up to over 100 degrees. We were not allowed to step out for fresh air. The supervisor even kept count of how many times we went to the toilet. We lived 36 people in one room. Another worker and I shared one tiny bed. We could only sleep on our side. If we lay on our back, we would pile on top of each other. Most of us were women. At night Mr. Lee often came into our room and lay next to whoever he liked. Once he forced me to give him a massage right in our bedroom. He called pretty ones into his office and forced them to have sex with him. Three women have publicly denounced him for that. Once, several of his customers arrived in American Samoa. Mr. Lee pressed several female workers to sleep with them. They resisted. At the workplace, he regularly groped and kissed female workers in front of everyone. There were three pregnant women among us. Mr. Lee demanded that they abortions. He fired them when they refused. Evicted from Daewoosa, they had to seek refuge at a local church. Movement at Daewoosa was very restricted. Everyone leaving the compound was searched by American Samoan guards. Female workers were groped all over their bodies. Those who protested were strip-searched. Those coming back from the compound after 9 pm were beaten up. I was once slapped. Mr. Lee used big American Samoan guards to terrorize us. Once, several workers staged a strike because they were not paid. He threatened that he would send these guards to short-circuit electric cables and cause a fire to kill us all. Everyone was fearful because two female workers, Nga and Dung, involved in the lawsuits against Mr. Lee had just disappeared. On November 28 of last year, there was a dispute between the supervisor and a female worker. Mr. Lee ordered the supervisor: “If you beat her to death, I will take the blame.” The supervisor dragged the female worker out by the chest. Other workers came to her rescue. The American Samoan guards, already holding sticks and scissors, jumped in. Everyone was so frightened. We ran for our lives. Mr. Lee ran after to beat the fleeing workers. We were terrorized for days after that. The guards paid special attention to the five or six workers known to have supported the lawsuit against Mr. Lee. They beat them the hardest. Ms. Quyen, the key witness in this lawsuit, was held by her arms on two sides by two guards. A third guard thrust a pointed stick into her eyes. As a result, she lost sight in that eye. A guard beat a male worker with a stick, breaking his front teeth and bleeding his mouth. Another male worker was pinned down to the floor and repeatedly beaten at his temple. His blood was spilling all over the floor. The next day, an FBI agent took pictures of the bloodstains. During the assault, Daewoosa’s lawyer and the police were there but did nothing. Only when the lawyer representing the workers showed up did the guards stop the beating. From 1999 to the above incident, Tour Company 12 and the international manpower supply, another Vietnamese company hiring workers for Daewoosa, forced us to continue working without pay and threatened to send us back to Vietnam if we disobeyed. Everyone was deeply in debt. If we got sent back, how could we pay our debt? Since my arrival in the US, I have sent every dollar earned back to Vietnam to pay my debt. However, this has barely made a dent because the interest rate is so high, 50 percent. My parents in Vietnam are very worried. Their hair has turned all gray. They told me that it is fortunate that I have come to the US; otherwise, we would be in a hopeless situation. If sent back, it would be hard for me to find employment. My previous workplace will not take me back. Because of my involvement in the prosecution of Mr. Lee, I am afraid of running into trouble with the government if repatriated to Vietnam. I am getting used to life in the US. Here I am free to choose where I want to work. If dissatisfied with one workplace, I can always go to another one. I have been thoroughly helped in my first step toward a normal life, and I find everyone to be very kind. I now live with a Vietnamese family without having to pay rent. That family offers me employment. They take care of my food, transportation and other things. They also give me a phone card to call my family in Vietnam once a week. Staying with me are six female workers from American Samoa. Two of them are here today. I have received a certification letter from the Department of Health and Human Services for public benefits. I have a temporary visa which will expire on October 30, 2002, and a work permit. I work at a nail salon in DC to pay my debts. If allowed to remain in the US, I would like to go back to school because in Vietnam I had to stop schooling at seventh grade. I also wish to be reunited with my child left behind in Vietnam. I am thankful to everyone who has helped me get out of American Samoa and everyone who has assisted me in this new life in the US."," In 1999, Vi was one of about 250 workers brought from Vietnam on a labor contract. A South Korean businessman named Kil Soo Lee had bought a garment factory near Pago Pago, in American Samoa, and required sewing machine operators. Vi was recruited by a Vietnamese government-owned enterprise called Tourism Company 12, and told she was heading for the US. Like the other recruits, she paid $5000 to cover the cost of airfare and work permits, and signed a three-year contract in exchange for monthly paychecks of around $400, plus free meals and housing, and return air fare. But upon arrival in American Samoa, the recruits were forced to work to pay off smuggling fees. Lee confiscated their passports to prevent them from escaping, and quickly stopped paying them altogether, though kept charging them for room and board. He withheld food, ordered beatings, and forced them to work 14-18 hour days. Female employees were sexually assaulted, and those who became pregnant were forced to have abortions or return to Vietnam. Vi’s story of slavery is also one of prosecution. In 2000, two workers at Lee’s factory sought legal help from attorneys. On behalf of more than 250 factory workers, the attorneys filed a pro-bono class-action lawsuit against Daewoosa and the Vietnamese government. The case was publicized by human rights groups, and the two workers who asked for legal help disappeared. Their bodies were never found. Then, in November 2000, a group of workers refused to return to their sewing machines, and a fight ensued between workers and factory guards. During the incident, one woman lost an eye and two other workers were hospitalized. This gained the attention of local law enforcement and the FBI Field Office in Honolulu began investigating Daewoosa in February 2001. Enforcing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), federal agents closed down the factory and arrested Lee on charges of involuntary servitude and forced labor. He was deported to Hawaii in March 2001. Though the recruiting companies and the Vietnamese government refused to pay for the workers’ flights home, they left American Samoa. Some returned to Vietnam and more than 200, including Vi, were flown to the US and admitted as potential witnesses for the prosecution at Lee’s trial. In April 2002, the High Court of American Samoa ordered the factory and two Vietnamese government-owned labor agencies to pay $3.5 million to the workers. Lee claimed bankruptcy. In February 2003, he was found guilty of involuntary servitude, extortion, money laundering and bribery, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court also ordered him to pay $1.8 million in restitution to the workers. Vi, and the other Vietnamese workers who came to the US, applied for “T” visas, issued to victims of trafficking as a result of the TVPA."
Beatrice,2005 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Sri Lank (trafficked from),Lebanon (slavery location),"Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you on the problem of slavery. I cannot believe that I am here, speaking to political leaders of the most powerful country in the world. If I close my eyes, the memories of pain take me back to a time when I felt all alone. It happened two decades ago, but it feels as if it were happening right now. I am at the airport in Columbo, Sri Lanka, saying good-bye to my three-year-old son. With his eyes filed with tears, he asks: “Can’t I come with you, Mom? When you make a lot of money will you by me a car to play with?” I take him in my arms, my heart breaking, and tell him, “If I have the money, I will buy you the world.” My desperation to give him a better life has driven me to leave him with my parents, to go to Lebanon and be a maid. At the job agent’s office in Beirut, my passport is taken away. The agency staff makes me stand in line with a group of women in the same predicament as me. Lebanese men and women pace in front of us, examining our bodies as if we were vacuum cleaners. I am sold to a wealthy woman, who takes me home to her mansion up on the fourth floor of a condo building. My chores seem unending. I wash the windows, walls, and bathrooms. I shampoo carpets, polish floors, and clean furniture. After 20 hours I am still not done. There’s no food on my plate for dinner, so I scavenge through the trash. I try to call the job agency, but the woman who now owns me has locked the telephone. I try to flee the apartment, but she has locked the door. I can feel the burning on my cheeks as she slaps me. It is night and her kids have gone to sleep. Grasping me by the hair, she bangs my head into the wall and throws me to the floor. She kicks me and hits me with a broom. If I scream or fight back, she will kill me. So I bite my lips to bear the pain and then I pass out. This is my daily routine, the life of a slave. But now I am standing on the balcony of her condo, four floors up. I am holding onto the railing, staring down at the ground far below. I feel my heart rising. I miss my family, and I know my son is waiting for me. There is no other way to get home. I grasp the railing, close my eyes, and ask God for his forgiveness if I die now. This is no suicide attempt. I am desperate for freedom, not death. With the tiny hope that I might survive, I let go of the railing. I dive backwards into the night air. And I scream. Dear leaders of Congress, how did a nice Sri Lankan girl like me end up jumping off a balcony in Lebanon? How did I end up in slavery? Could this have been prevented? And how did I survive the leap?... Let me make a few observations about the problem of human trafficking from the point of view of someone who experienced it. 1) We need more public awareness campaigns about the dangers of trafficking. I got swept up in human trafficking because I did not understand the risks. I needed to make money, and like many people from South and Southeast Asia, I pursued work in the Middle East. I didn’t know my passport would get taken away, and I didn’t know that I wouldn’t get paid. We can reduce the power of traffickers by educating at-risk populations. People don’t know what can happen to them and can easily be tricked. So here is my suggestion: We need to make sure there are public service announcements and public education campaigns, not just in the US but around the world. For example, I am ready today to record a message for Sri Lankans, in Singhalese, telling them about what happened to me and warning them to be aware. 2) We need to monitor—and make sure other governments are monitoring—the job agencies that send so many people to work in the Middle East. In my case, there was an office in Sri Lanka and an office in Lebanon. The directors of these offices are both responsible for what happened to me. They did nothing to help me, and they never paid me. These agencies are sending thousands of people to work overseas. In fact, the population of Kuwait is two-thirds foreign workers. The percent of foreign workers in the United Arab Emirates is even higher. People like me are actually the majority, even though we have no guaranteed rights. The waves of workers arriving in these countries come through job agencies, but the agencies are not being watched closely enough. One idea is to insist that agencies have registration programs, so relatives of workers can always track them down. My parents back in Sri Lanka were worried sick about me and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t answering their letters. But they had no way to reach me. We need accountability, and we should pressure governments around the world to monitor job agencies more closely. And job agencies should be made liable if employees’ rights are violated by the contracted employers. 3) We need to give survivors of slavery a platform to speak out and help other survivors recover. After I jumped off the balcony, I blacked out. I woke up later in the hospital, paralyzed. Eventually, I got a flight home to Sri Lanka. I didn’t speak much about what had happened to me. I was ashamed, and I quietly prayed to God for strength. Only a few years ago, I began to feel I was ready to discuss what had happened to me… We need to remove the shame from slavery. To do that, survivors need to talk openly about their experience in order to help victims of trafficking recover. Our message is that there is no reason to be ashamed, even though you will at first feel ashamed. Our message is that you have to believe in yourself and hold on to your faith, even if people will treat you like an animal. There is a spiritual and psychological side to the recovery process that should not be neglected. 4) We need to have even tougher monitoring of foreign countries. Every year, the State Department’s annual report on trafficking should list the amount of money each country spends on anti-trafficking efforts. We need to evaluate if funding matches performance. The report should also document the repression of anti-slavery groups. For instance, in Mauritania the government still bans the abolitionist group SOS Slaves. The US should do more to support anti-slavery activists in repressive countries where the government doesn’t allow free discussion on the issue of slavery. And the US should fund a commission of government officials and NGO activists to ensure the liberation of all slaves in Sudan. Dear congressional leaders, I speak before you on behalf of the millions of slaves who could not be here even if you invited them. Just a few weeks ago I read about an Indonesian maid enslaved in Bahrain who, like me, was so desperate that she jumped off a fourth-floor balcony. It pains me to think that two decades after I had to dive off a balcony to save my life, women are still facing the same agonizing situation. We can be doing much more to help these women—and children and men. We need to educate them about the dangers of slavery before they get caught up. We need to monitor the job agencies that ensnare them. We need to help them overcome their shame after they escape. And we need to hold accountable the repressive governments that are part of the problem rather than part of the solution."," After several months in slavery, Beatrice Fernando reached the point of no return. Standing on a fourth-floor balcony in Beirut, Lebanon, she realized there was “no other way to get home” but to “dive backwards.” In a recent interview she explained of her decision to step off the balcony: “When we take a step against slavery, the world will take another step.”In 1980, at the age of 23, Beatrice had responded to an advertisement for work as a housemaid in Lebanon. She left her home country of Sri Lanka, intending to send money to her parents and her three-year-old son. But in Beirut she became a domestic slave. She was locked inside a home, starved, beaten, never paid, and forbidden from communicating with the outside world. Guards were instructed to shoot her if she tried to leave. After she reached a turning-point and escaped by jumping from the apartment’s fourth floor, she spent 21 days in a coma. Doctors told her that she was paralyzed. After 14 months in hospital she recovered from the paralysis and returned to Sri Lanka. In 1989 she came to live and work in the US."
Kavita,2004 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,"",India (slavery location),"My sister and I were living in a village. We were happy. We were poor and our parents had to struggle to give us a daily existence, but there was a bond. There was love, there was affection. I’m 14 now, so when I left home I was about 12. But even though I was 12, I was still very innocent. I hadn’t seen life beyond my home. When we came to the house in Allahabad, they made every single effort to break my bond with my sister. I was tied and thrown into a room like a piece of furniture. I had clear instructions not to talk to my sister or to speak with her, to have no contact with her—almost like I didn’t exist. I was nothing. In front of me, my sister was beaten up, tortured, made to work every day. I couldn’t console her. It was crazy. This was my sister, someone I shared every single moment of my life with. There was no bond. Think about it. I am sitting in a corner, tied, a witness to the beating of my younger sister. Even being elder, I’m unable to protect her. I can only hear her cries of pain. I can’t talk to her. Nothing. Each time I think about that, I just stagnate. My thoughts become still. I can’t think beyond the fact that there’s a possibility I will never meet her again. The pain is so deep. I’m alone. Pretty much at a loss for words. When I left that house, I had no idea about anything—where I would land up, what I would do. I was just so scared. I didn’t know anything. When I was waiting at the station, fear crept into my heart. I kept thinking: “Where will I go from here? What will I do?” Even when I came to the shelter, I was very scared. I refused to speak for the first two days. I just cried and cried. I would sleep uncontrollably for days. Ravatni helped me a lot. She talked to me and would console me: “I understand that you have a ten year-old sister who’s been left behind. I understand that your parents are dead. But you must also understand the fact that there’s nothing you can do about this at this point in time. You’re in a new place, a place that can teach you a lot. So maybe it’s possible for you to try forgetting the past and move on.” Something went down, registered, slowly. But even then, I was just so emotional I did not want to study. I would see others around me opening their books, studying. But even though my mind was in it, my heart wasn’t. So Ravatni encouraged me with this thought: that I would help out the tiny ones. Any younger child I would see, I would help them out with the homework, with little lessons that I could do. And then there was a friend of mine, Sonia. I would steal her books and read from them. So my interest developed. I began to read little by little and now each time I see a book I want to devour it. So my interest in studies is definitely increased. It’s a lot to do with Ravatni—her encouragement, her wisdom, her knowledge and the confidence that she gave me to start my life afresh. Now I’m happy, very very happy, happy with the life I’m leading over here and happy when I think where I could be, in the place where my sister is right now. But even though I am happy at the life and the activities that I do here, each time I think about my sister and what she has to go through in her daily life, I am just so hurt, so resentful and so angry. I am happy about my luck and my fortune, that I am where I am, but still angry at what she is suffering. When I ran away from that place, it was the very first time I had come to Allahabad, so I was not familiar with the names of the places or where her house is. I have descriptions, I know the village setup. The house where she was working was a big house. There was a shop close by and that’s what all I remember. I remember what it looked like but not the exact location of it or the name of the place. People who do such things must understand that we are children. We are so innocent, so vulnerable. They must understand they must not do this to anyone, anywhere. What I would like to say to the world is when it comes to children, they’re small, they’re innocent, they’re vulnerable. They just like playing, laughing, having fun, and very often they are unable to comprehend the repercussions of what the elders are doing to them. I believed them, and I went with them to that house. What I’ve learned from this shelter is how to become a better human being. I learned the values of empathy, the values of sympathy, the values of sincerity. To deal with not only my pain but that of somebody else. How to respect emotions; how to know when to give people space; how to talk to the person who’s tormenting me, to explain what they’re doing is wrong in a polite yet effective manner. I’ve learned how to deal with myself and with others. I want to grow up and I want to study to become a nurse. I want to become a nurse so I can help other people and look after them in their hour of need."," There are millions of enslaved domestics in India, and a further 264,000 child domestics in Pakistan. Children are often sent away from their villages to work in order to clear a family debt. These loans have immensely high rates of interest, and in many cases no remuneration is given at all. The debt is often passed onto a younger sibling or onto the domestic’s own children. The children work 15 or more hours a day, seven days a week, for little or no pay under abusive conditions, generally have little or no freedom of movement, are denied schooling, and are often sexually exploited. Consequently, domestic work is often a precursor to commercial sex work. Many domestics in India—some as young as seven or eight—are on duty around the clock, sleep on the kitchen floor, eat leftovers, and have no holidays or rest breaks. Kavita’s psychological turning-point from slavery to freedom came some months after her escape from domestic slavery. As she explains, there was no turning-point upon her initial arrival at a shelter: “I was very scared. I refused to speak for the first two days. I just cried and cried.” It was only when she reversed the most traumatic aspect of her experience in slavery that Kavita reached a turning-point. Trafficked with her younger sister into domestic servitude within India in 2002, at the age of 12, Kavita was forced to watch her sister “beaten up, tortured, made to work every day.” She recalls “sitting in a corner, tied, a witness to the beating of my younger sister…unable to protect her…Each time I think about that, I just stagnate.” But when she was encouraged her to “help out the tiny ones” at the shelter, Kavita was able to counter this trauma. She began to gain confidence to “start my life afresh.”"
Maria,2005 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I grew up in a village of between 500 and 700 people. Most of the people there were family; cousins, my grandpa, my uncles. Everybody was family. It was a very, very nice life for me, growing up with my parents, on the farm, with my brothers and sisters. When I was a little girl I saw my parents working hard, and my dream was to one day become somebody, have money, and give them the best in life; treat them like a king and queen. I always wanted to take care of my parents. That was my dream. I was 15, I was going to be 16, and my father came to this country. He came to get his residential card, and I came with him. And he left. I stayed here. It wasn’t my plan to stay here, I thought I was going to go back with my father. But he left after two weeks and I stayed here with my sister. A month later I got a job offer from this woman I didn’t know. She offered me a cleaning job, and coming from my country, it was like, wow! I’m going to get a job! I believed her, I thought it was real. But it wasn’t a job. It was just a trick, a trap that I fell into. I didn’t even ask how much they were going to pay or anything. She told me not to tell my family and that she was coming very soon. It sounded good because I was going to surprise them with the job. She didn’t show up for another week or so. I forgot about it. But then she came and asked me if I still wanted a job, and I said: “Yes. I want the job.” She told me to go and meet the people. My sister was working, I was at the house by myself, and my brother-in-law was at work. I was going to go and tell him that I was going to go to this place, but she told me not to do anything—told me: “Just let’s go. We’re coming back very soon.” She took me to the place, and it felt like it took forever. I didn’t know the area—I just knew how to get to my niece’s school and to the store. She took me all the way to Azuza. I was living in Sierra Madre, so it was a long drive. When we got there, I met this old man. Probably he was 65 or 70, I don’t know. When I met him, he had a big smile. She introduced me to him. It was kind of nice, but at the same time, it was creepy—like, you don’t want to be there. But I didn’t follow my instinct. I didn’t. And I should have. It didn’t feel right for me to be there. They told me to sit on the couch, and I sat down. They went away and talked—I don’t know what they talked about. They came back and I told them: “I want to go back to my house.” He told me not to go but to stay there and start working. I didn’t want to stay there. He kept telling me: “You stay here, you’ll meet my wife. And then I’ll take you to your house tomorrow.” I didn’t want to, but between the two of them they convinced me. They told me to call my sister, but the funny thing was the phone had a lock. He removed it from the phone, and he let me call my sister. When I called my sister, she didn’t want me to stay there. She goes: “No, you’re coming home.” I explained to her that it was an old couple, and she asked me for address, the phone number, the names. She kept telling me to come home. I said: “I’m coming tomorrow.” That tomorrow never came, never came until a year ago. A year ago I came home. The third day in the house he told me that he had bought me, that I was his slave, that he paid $200 for me, that I was there to do whatever he wanted to do to me. I didn’t have a mind of my own. I was controlled by his witchcraft. He told me he was a witch. I was afraid of him. I was terrorized by him. He beat me, raped me, everyday he abused me mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. I was not in touch with my family because I was afraid of saying something to them that he disliked, or making him think that I was going to escape. I lived in fear. When I fell asleep because I was so tired, I’d get woken up by him putting things on my face, and telling me: “You have the curse and you cannot leave this house.” My family reported him to the police, and the police came to the house. I opened the door, cause he told me to. The policeman sat on the couch asking me if I’m okay, asking me in front of this man, and how can I say: “no I’m not”? I was so afraid of him, because he had threatened to kill my family. And he threatened to kill me. Every time that I did something that he disliked or I didn’t want to have anything to do with him, he told me that he was going to kill me. I can actually tell you that I’m a miracle because so many times I was close to dying. Once in a while I thought, how can I get out of here? But then I changed. I was afraid to think that. He told me that he knew what I thought. He had me believe that he saw everything in his crystal ball. So I believed him. My family suspected that I was not in the right place, that I didn’t want to be there, and they did send the police but I was afraid that he was going to kill my family so I told the police that I was fine. I was afraid. I couldn’t allow him to do something to my family. By then I hadn’t seen anything. I didn’t know nothing. I was just a teenager, 16. I wanted to be with my family the way I was before, and my dreams were crushed, crushed. They never let me bloom, like a rose. They never let the rose grow up to be a rose. That’s how I felt. Ya know, faith is the last string in my life. I can be almost at the edge of falling down, and my faith is going to keep on going. I always dreamed. I dreamed that I was in a tunnel and the little dot of light was freedom to me. Every time that I had that dream, I knew that was my freedom. But I had no way out. I just used to pray a lot. I thought God had forgotten me. I asked him why. I asked him give me a sign, to show me something that I can see, feel, touch. To give me a sign that I’m going to be okay, and that my family’s going to be okay if I leave this house. I remember spending nights crying and praying on my knees. And I did lose faith in God. I felt like he forgot me, because I was begging for him to show me a sign. I used to ask God: “Why did you forget about me? I’m your child.” I kept on like that, day after day, day after day. After I reached 18, he sent me to work in the factory and I brought my check back. A lot of times I wanted to die, just die. That was my only way out. I didn’t want to provoke my own death, but I wanted to die. I was just living one more day. Either he was going to kill me or I was going to die. The way I ended up in prison was that he had another place in back of his house. He rented to a young couple and tried to pursue the wife. He was trying to do witchcraft on them and one day the young guy killed him. I heard the noise and I came out. The victim was on the ground. The only thing I remember is that he told me to grab the stick and put it under the house. I did that. He put it in my hand and I did it. I put the stick under the house. I didn’t know anything else but to follow commands. I don’t even know if I called my family or how my family got there, but my sister came and took me with her. I was like a zombie. I didn’t talk, I didn’t want to eat, I couldn’t sleep, and I was very fearful, thinking that he was coming to get me. I was arrested and I felt that he was going to come and get me. I spent one year fighting my case but I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t understand the law terms, I didn’t speak English, I didn’t understand what they were saying. My family didn’t know anything about laws or attorneys either, so they got ripped off. The attorney who represented me was already disbarred and he was using someone else’s bar number to fight my case. He promised my family that I was going to be free by Christmas. I never got free. I was sentenced to 25 years to life. They felt that they needed to blame someone in order for them to be safe. They said whatever they wanted to say. When the parole members used to come they wanted me to say that I was guilty. And I was not going to say anything like that because they asked me to put my hand on the Bible and told me to swear that I was going to tell them the truth. It was not the truth that they wanted to hear from me. They did an investigation on my case and they found out that I hadn’t done it. They went in and interviewed people at my job and asked them if they knew me, how I looked, how I was. They found out that I’d been telling them the truth. I just wanted somebody to listen. To believe in me. And to know that I been telling the truth—just a little bit of justice. I wanted to get out of there. I felt that I had done more than enough time. I just wanted a chance. I wasn’t going to go crazy outside, I was going to be a normal person. I thought I could be an asset to society. I did a lot of things while I was in prison. I figured, I’m not going to be here one year or two, I’m going to be here longer. I chose to use my time productively and to be a better person. I was going to be a decent human being. And I had a family who every time that I did something good they were very happy. That was my payback. To see how happy they used to get when I got my GED, when they heard me speaking English, when I used to write them in English, even though it was hard for them to understand. I was going to show them that I was doing something. Professors used to come in there and teach us. So I took classes. I learned a lot of trades. I learned computing, the basics. I learned how to work with people. I got involved in HIV education because people need to be aware of certain things and not put down people with that disease. They need love, they need help, they need care. Not to be put in the corner and forgotten. They are also human beings. And we don’t know—I could be the next to have AIDS. We never know. I feel a lot of compassion for people who are ill and elderly people. I work with doctors, with people who are mentally distraught, and I get so much joy from doing that. I have a lot of people around me who have been supporting me in different ways. They don’t know me, they just hear about me, but they believe in me. Their support means a lot to me. I will keep that forever. I’m sitting here today because of all those people. I owe my freedom to them all. The day they told me that I was going to be free, a bird came and told me at the window. I was very sad that day and the bird came. With his little beak, he knocked the window and I knew I was going to have some good news. And I told the person that was in with me, I’m going to have some good news today. I didn’t know anything. The bird came and confirmed it. He came and knocked the window again with his beak. I put my plate at the table to eat and they knocked at the window and told me."," Maria Suarez marks the turning-point in her decades-long journey from slavery to freedom as the moment when a bird knocked at her window. She had no idea she about to be freed, but when the bird came she knew that she “was going to have some good news.” She waited, and minutes later officials told her she was going to be free. At the age of 15, in 1976, Maria immigrated legally to the US from Michoacan, Mexico, with her father. She was soon approached on the street in Los Angeles by a woman offering work as a cleaner. But instead the woman sold her to 68-year-old Anselmo Covarrubias for $200, and Covarrubias made her his domestic slave. For five years he held her in bondage in his house in the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa, raped and beat her, and threatened her with black arts wizardry. Maria believed that he read her mind, possessed her soul, and would hurt her family if she told anyone about the abuse. In August 1981, Covarrubias was bludgeoned to death with a table leg by Pedro Soto, who was renting a converted garage on the property. Maria washed the weapon and hid it under the house, as directed by Soto. She was arrested, along with Soto and his wife. Soto was convicted of first-degree murder, and his wife was convicted of soliciting murder and being an accessory to a felony. Maria was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, sentenced to 25 years to life, and incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona. Officials eventually confirmed that she suffered from battered woman’s syndrome — allowed as a legal defense in California after in 1992 — and she was paroled in 2003, after five years in slavery, and 22.5 years in prison."
Mende,2003 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,United Kingdom (slavery location) Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was living in a village, Karko, in the Nuba mountains with my parents, two sisters and two brothers. We had a very simple life. One night, when I was 12 or 13, we heard a noise outside. The village was under fire. People were screaming and there was confusion. We didn’t know what we had to do, my dad said: “Mende, trust me, grab me hard.” I clung on to him and he told my mum to stay close to me. We had to run, we had to survive. When we finally reached the mountains, raiders were everywhere. We couldn’t escape. Many people were dead. We ran and ran; we had nowhere to hide. It was very crowded and I lost my dad. Somebody caught at me and said “I will protect you and I will take you back to your parents later.” I said okay. I believed him really because it was very dangerous. I saw people being killed in front of me; they killed the people at night, and raped the girls. He took me from this place to somewhere in the forest. When I got there I found some girls and boys there and stayed with them, he said to stay there. They were around ten and 12 years old. We were happy because we all thought we were going back to our parents later. But after a while, all the raiders came and took everybody to a place called Geling, about a day’s walk away. I was there for a few days; everyday people came and took children away. A man came to the camp and chose us; I was taken in a car with five other girls to a house in a place called Khartoum. He would not let us out. We had to work all day. One by one the girls were taken away. One day, a woman came and took me away. This is my new life ...this is a hard time; I stayed with this woman for six or seven years. I had to do very hard work, I had to do everything: clean the house and big yard, wash clothes by hand and look after her children; over time there were five. After she saw I was clean she had me cook. Everything that was mine was kept separate. After a while, I started to play with the children, and the children liked to play with me; I liked to play, I was still a child. Before being captured I was in school, now I am not. I was beaten for every single thing, even for something that was not my fault. At first I wanted to leave, but I couldn’t because there was nowhere to go and I had no money and I could not go to the police. From the beginning in my master’s house I didn’t realize I was a slave, I was confused; I wondered why I was here. Later on, my master was talking to her friend and she said two things that made me realize. One was she mentioned she owned me. The other, she called me “Abda” to her friend. She called me her slave. From that time on I understood who I am. From the beginning she treated me badly and beat me; even then I couldn’t understand why. It was only when she said she was my owner and that she called me Abda then I understood. One day she told me I was going to London. I cried because it meant I would be farther from my family. My master told me what to say for the visa. She told me a name to give of the person I would work for and told me to say that I was only cleaning and washing dishes. I was asked how long I was going to stay and what I would earn. I said I didn’t know—he was surprised so the interview ended. I was given a letter to give to my master with these questions. She said I would be there six months and the amount I would earn. She took me to the airport and said I would be collected. I worked in London as a domestic. My master in Khartoum instructed me to behave myself and obey the new master and do the same sort of work I did for her. Now I feel I’m free because I am doing things I never used to do before. For me the reason for talking out is to help make another slave free—not just a slave from Sudan, but from anywhere in the world. By talking out, people will be more aware and more able to help people become free. I am studying to improve my English. My hope first is to see my family and to be a nurse."," In 1994, when Mende Nazer was about 12, Arab militia stormed her village in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. They raped and massacred the villagers and sold Mende and other children into slavery, as part of the Muslim-dominated government’s war strategy against rebels in south Sudan. For about six years Mende was beaten, sexually abused, fed food scraps, and kept prisoner as a domestic slave for a family in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. At the age of 19 she was taken to London and passed onto the family of a Sudanese diplomat, becoming one of an estimated 6000 women who have been trafficked into Britain in the past few years (mainly from countries in Eastern Europe, Africa and South Asia)."
Ashok,2004 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,"",India (slavery location),"I was fortunate to work for a little period at the loom compared to the other children. I came to the loom with one of the owner’s family members eight months before the date of rescue. As usual my father was tricked by a trafficker, through his false promises of a better future for me—food, education and income. I was sent with the man for just 2000 rupees [$45]. Due to the poor condition of the family and a huge debt after my brother’s marriage, I decided to go with the man to rescue my family from debt. It was a very fearful experience for me when I entered the loom, which was very dark. I was not able to see things clearly. I was amazed to see children working in such a miserable condition but now I was also part of it. I was forced to work in miserable conditions at the loom with no proper food to eat. I was provided with poor quality as well poor quantity of food. Sometimes there was no salt and sometimes a full packet of salt. The food was watery with no nutritious value and of such a bad quality that even animals would also not wish to eat it. I was made to work continuously from seven in the morning to seven in the evening. I got only one hour of break either to take rest or lunch. My master tortured me both physically and mentally. When I was not able to finish my work, I received beatings with slipper and bamboo sticks from owner of the loom. One day his torture crossed its limit, my both hands were tied to the trunk of the tree and I was beaten very badly. I was not able to come out of that situation for more than one and a half months. I felt that I had been so happy at my house. At the time of any illness and sickness such as fever, pain in my legs, hand, backbone, I was treated badly and also not given any proper care to recover from the sickness. I tried to escape from the loom but was caught by the owner’s father who used to do guard duty during the night. This made me very disappointed and very often I thought of my past days when I was free to play, free to go anywhere I wanted and enjoy my life in the field when I use graze my cattle along with my friends. I was not allowed to go anywhere, even when there was a problem in my family. I never got any leave. Whenever I asked for leave, the owner clearly said: “first return my money and only then you will be allowed to go home.” I was getting mentally depressed and used to get angry very quickly whenever I talked with other boys working along with me. But I was not able to understand what was happening to me."," There are hundreds of thousands of children trapped in India’s carpet industry. Most of India’s carpets are woven in Uttar Pradesh, where the majority of workers are low-caste Hindu boys. Some are lured into bondage by agents’ promises to their parents that they will receive good wages, and others are kidnapped. The boys are forced to work for no pay, for 10-18 hours a day, seven days a week. They are beaten, tortured, branded, kept half fed and half clad, and are usually made to sleep in the loom shed. Cuts and wounds are frequent. Ashok was trafficked into a carpet loom in Uttar Pradesh. He was liberated by activists from Bal Vikas Ashram (BVA), an organization that liberates and rehabilitates child slaves. He and other boys were found weaving carpets, wearing only underwear, and had been forced to weave rugs for 12-15 hours a day, beginning at 6am. After their liberation, the boys were taken to BVA, in Uttar Pradesh, where they received medical care, counseling, literacy training, and basic rights education. They returned to their villages after six months. BVA continues to liberate children."
Choti,2004 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour Debt bondage,Debt bondage,India (slavery location),"My name is Choti. I think I’m about 20 years old. When I was getting married, I took a loan from the slave owners. At that point I ended up becoming a bonded laborer. Before my marriage I was not a slave. I was free. I would work in the fields, but I was a field worker. I think I got a loan of about 5000 rupees [$100], for ceremonies, the guests, the miscellaneous expenses of my marriage. But I took 5000 and I repaid 10,000 [$200] for a long, long time. From the time when my kids were tiny to the time when they could work, that’s the amount of time I was a bonded laborer. I would go back and ask them: “Is the debt over? Have I repaid it all?” They would say: “No, no, now it increased. It was 10,000. Now it is 20,000.” Then: “No, no it is not 20,000 anymore, now it is 30,000.” I was not earning anything. I was barely earning some grain, some rice. How was I to repay the loan? I had no idea. This carried on and carried on and carried on. Life was very tough. I was made to work in the fields the whole day, whether the children were crying or not, or when anyone was sick. I was not allowed to go home. Every single day, for long hours, I was expected to be working very hard. Not only were we made to work in the fields, we were also made to work in the stone quarry, to break up the stones and make them into tiny pieces. For all our effort we were hardly paid. Once the breaking of stones was over, we were also forced to lift them up and load them onto the truck. I was very scared of the slave owners because they would issue directions: “Go and work here. Go break the stones.” You could not refuse because the next step was: “I’ll burn your house.” That’s it, every day. The threat was so strong, and I knew they could carry it out. Therefore I had no choice. We had to go and work. Life under the slave owners was complete hell. The females were especially harassed. The men would go off to work, either to the fields or the stone quarries, and the slave owners would come to our house, show us a huge knife and compel us to work. If you would refuse, saying the males had already gone, they would just drag us by the hair and compel us to work. Things got so bad that when the slave owners came to one woman’s house and she refused, he had a huge knife and he just killed her. We never knew when a tractor would come and just drive over us and kill us. And once in the night, the contractor came to a woman’s house and raped her. There were no rights, nothing. One day a girl had gone to work in the fields and when she came back, the contractor wanted to misbehave with her. She tried running away and as she was running he burned down her house. He burned down a lot of houses and a girl was burnt right inside. They burned our houses, our food, our clothes. Everything was burned down. It seemed certain that they would lock us inside the house and burn us. They almost did. Sacks of grain were burned, everything was completely destroyed. We had to run away. Not a thing was left, everything was gone, completely evaporated. We had to all come out and move to a village. We were left to live below plastic sheets. No walls, no roof, nothing. It was very tough. That’s what we had come down to. The basic utensils weren’t there, the utensils on which we cook chapati weren’t there. Nothing. The night that the houses burned down, not only were my eyes weeping, my very soul was torn, shattered. We saw crying and wailing. It was sheer agony. My husband was in prison and my son died during that time. But I did think things would get better because the interaction with Sankalp had begun. So I knew there was a ray of hope. There was an expectation that something would give and change would come about. My children were homeless. But something was going to happen. I knew it. The females played a very big role in getting revolution. When we had initial meetings with the local authorities and with Sankalp, they told us to coordinate with each other. That didn’t mean very much to us at that point. But slowly, when we had a couple of meetings here and a couple of meetings there, things began to sink in, and we came to realize we were doing all the work. We are the ones who are cutting the stones, we are the ones loading the lorries every single day and not getting any assistance or any monetary benefit. That’s when we all met the Sankalp members and took action into our hands. Initially when Sankalp would come down to the village and interact with us, the contractors did not like the idea: “You motherfuckers,” is what they would scream at us, “What are you doing?” So on and so forth. Seeing this just got our enthusiasm more aroused, and that’s when we started taking Sankalp more seriously. The Sankalp people said: “Look, you have food that you grow yourself, you have labor that you do by yourself.” They made us aware of the fact that it was possible for us to be self-sufficient, for us to be able to sell and buy our own food grains, for us to be able to educate our children. They made us realize that we were exploited and that we were under the control of the slave owners. We knew that, of course. We were aware that there was an evil person who would come and beat us up, but they made us aware there was something we could do about it, that it was possible for us to get together move toward the cities and the towns and then bring about a revolution. The Sankalp people helped us a lot after the burning. They came together and gave us a vessel on which to cook our food, they gave us medical help and assistance for our children. I love my life now. I just simply love it. My children are going to school. I have food in my stomach. Ever since I held the hand of Sankalp, I love my life. There is so much happening in it now, so many good things. I’ve got a lease on a house, I’m free, there’s education, my children are happy, I’m happy. My dream for my children is that they grow up, they become people who can read, who can write, who can live in the cities and have a job. They shouldn’t be like us, any of us. They should not be working to break stones, they should not be dying like we do, day in and day out, under the hot sun. They should be people who live a life in the cities, big people. That’s my dream. I have five kids and I don’t work now. Before, when my children woke up, they would be rubbing their eyes and I would be far, far away in some field, working under the slave owners. Now I don’t work. I get up, I feed my kids and send them to school. They come back. I relax in the afternoon. In the evening I make sure they’re okay. You know, a regular wife. That’s what I do now. That’s my life. All I want is that nobody remains bonded anymore. That every child is free, free to study, free to learn, free to live their own life."," In 2000, some of the 220 residents of Sonebarsa, a quarrying village in Uttar Pradesh, India, revolted against their slaveholders. About 40 families lived in Sonebarsa, all of them Kols, an ethnic group near the bottom of India’s steep ladder of caste and discrimination, and all locked into hereditary debt bondage. Children worked from the age of three or four, and infant mortality was high. Choti was one of the slaves who rebelled. The villagers had begun meeting with organizers from Sankalp, a grassroots NGO that has so far helped 4000 slaves to free themselves from slavery in the stone quarries of Uttar Pradesh. Seeyawati, who works for Sankalp, explained that organizers offered the villagers two things initially: “an example of another village where we’d been able to get some progress done,” and the question: “how long could they live this life as a slave?” Bala, who also works for Sankalp, added: “Earlier on there was no hope at all amongst the people. They didn’t believe they could be free. We gave them a new hope, and said to them: ‘What has happened has happened. The past is past. But it’s up to you to make a change, because it’s your life and the lives of your children.’” The slaves began to organize. Women were particularly central to this process of self-liberation, as Bala explained: “When one of the slave owners came to a house and raped a man’s wife, 15 females came out of their houses and said ‘No more,’ formed their own self-help group and joined us in the movement.” The narratives focus on the role of women in the process of self-liberation: Choti observes that the women “played a very big role in getting revolution.The slaves called a mass meeting, and were joined by 3,500 people from 60 villages. Slaveholders interrupted the meeting, attacked the villagers, and shot guns into the air. The villagers retaliated by throwing stones and one of the contractors was killed. His friends set fire to Sonebarsa—“not a thing was left, everything was gone,” recounts Choti. Eight men from the village were scapegoated and jailed, including Choti’s husband. After the burning of Sonebarsa, Sankalp assisted the 40 refugee families and helped them form micro-credit unions. The villagers pooled their money, and petitioned for a mining lease. But the Allahabad Mining Corporation wouldn’t allow leases and so the villagers moved onto unoccupied land in Uttar Pradesh and began mining it. Authorities protested this in court, but a judge ruled that no unauthorized workwas being done and signed leases. Today the villagers continue to build their community, which they have named Azad Nagar, “the land which is free.”"
Christina ,2005 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Cameroon (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Christina Elangwe. I was born in a village in Cameroon, south west province. I have four older sisters and three brothers. I grew up, I went to elementary school, I finished elementary school. My dream was to go to high school and my parents didn’t have enough money to send me to high school right away. I didn’t want to wait for the whole semester and an opportunity came. An old lady from another city came to the village looking for somebody to come live with her. She was going to put me in school, so I accepted and went to a city to live with her. But I didn’t go to school right away, though I was there for maybe a year. Then the old lady told me that they would like me to go the United States to take care of kids. I said okay, and they sent me back to the village to inform my parents. At first my Dad refused—he said it was too far away. But we convinced him. I said, this is my dream—America. I always dreamed of this, and watched movies back home. America was like heaven. Sometimes I would sit and talk to myself about how I would like to go to America, because back home it was like America was like gold and silver. I wanted to go there to further my education, so when the opportunity came I thought, okay this it. The agreement was that as soon as I came here I would start school. I came in the month of February, and they told me that the semester would soon be over and that next semester I was going to start school. The agreement was that I’m going to baby-sit and while I’m baby-sitting continue my education and go to school. That whole year passed and they didn’t send me to school. They only sent me for two days a week to the GED class, and it was free too. The following year came and I asked them. They said they were still thinking about it and they’re going to send me. I should wait. Days go by, years go by, you start figuring that these people are not going to do anything. Maybe their kids will grow up and go to college before they even start thinking about it. Or maybe they will never think of doing anything. When I asked her one time, the lady told me that just bringing me into America is more than good enough—they don’t have to do anything with me. Just to come here I should feel lucky—there are other people dying to come here and they can’t. I should be happy that I’m here. It was seven days a week. I did everything from five in the morning until maybe midnight or 1am. I had to get up, get the kids ready, give them showers, make their breakfast, keep on doing household jobs like cleaning, cooking, everybody’s laundry, ironing, and when the kids came back from school I gave them lunch. Sometimes when there was an occasion coming up I would stay up until 4am or 5am to braid their kids’ hair. Sometimes I felt sorry for myself—sad. Just hoping one day everything is going to be okay, or one day it’s going to be over. Nobody was allowed to call me and I wasn’t allowed to call anybody. The five years I was with them I never talked to my parents. They would tell me that they’re trying to get hold of my parents but they were lying. They always talked to their own parents but when it was time for me to talk with my parents, the line didn’t go through. I never received any letters. I wrote letters and I don’t know whether my parents received them or not. I never wrote letters when they’re around, but when the kids were in school and I was home cleaning, things were going through my mind. They never paid me anything while I was there. When I asked them, they said they didn’t have to. I asked them for something after I was there for about three or four years, and they told me they were not paying me but they were paying my parents. I knew they were lying to me, but I never talked to my parents while I was there. I think they were just telling me that so that I would feel better. I was thinking about getting out but there was no way. I didn’t know anybody, but I was just praying for one day to come when I could be free. I never knew when the day would be. I was just hoping and praying and I was mad. I should have just stayed back home. I should have listened to my Dad. I should have continued my education back home. I talked to Roseline on the phone and cried, and tried to figure out what to do. But there was no means. If we leave, where are we going to go? We didn’t know anybody, so just had to stay there. Until one day she couldn’t take it in there anymore, she had to run away. When she ran she opened the door for all of us. She took a big step. After she ran away, she and Mr. Louis Etongwe contacted me. Roseline told me that I have to get out of there, and that there was somebody who is going to help us to be free. At first I didn’t know. It took me a while to trust Mr. Louis Etongwe. I talked to him and I thought, I have to do it, I have to do something for myself and my family. It took me a month or two for me to make the decision to leave though. I’m sure around that time, when Roseline went, they knew that I knew something about it, because they were asking me where she was, and whether she would contact me or not. I said, no, I won’t hear from her. Their eyes went wide open; they were thinking maybe I’ll be the next person. So they had tape recorders around the house, just in case anybody called me. They told me, even if I wanted to run away I shouldn’t do it the way Roseline did. I finally realized that there was no hope if I continued living with this family. So I’d better do something. It was about time. I’d already given them five years of my life, now it was my turn. I had to do something for myself. So I told Mr. Louis that I was ready. When the employer dropped me off where I used to take the GED classes, I asked a few people for change to catch the bus and they gave it to me. I asked how to get to Silver Springs Metro Station. They told me, and I took the bus and went there. Mr. Louis Etongwe came and picked me up. He’s a very nice man. He’s the one who helped us get out of this situation. He really helped us after we left. I wouldn’t have left otherwise, and I actually lived in his house until I was able to take care of myself. I’m very grateful for that too. When I didn’t trust him it was because I didn’t know him. The only people I knew were my employers and their sisters and friends. And they were treating me like ruined stock, saying America is a bad place, you can go out there and get killed, you can’t make it in America. Afterwards I used to think a lot about the kids, especially the youngest one. I was really really close with her. But then I thought, they have their parents and I’m here by myself. I’d helped them enough already and I had to think about myself now. My parents heard about it because Mr. Louis Etongwe took a tape back home and put it on for them to watch. They were really really sad and said, “they should send my child back home.” I consider myself a slave because I worked for so many hours without getting paid, and without going to school. And I couldn’t leave. I feel like they stole my life from me. We didn’t know anything like this happened. It’s like we were brainwashed so we didn’t know the laws, we didn’t know the rules. All we knew was what they were telling us. And we believed all that they were saying. We were blind then. Anybody in my situation shouldn’t take that long to get help. There’s help out there. They shouldn’t believe it when their employers are telling them it’s scary out there. There are good people out there. They should reach for help immediately if they’re not getting what they were promised. And no matter what, you shouldn’t send your child away, especially with strangers. The people were found guilty. They pleaded guilty and they did some community service. They were asked to pay me some money for the years that I worked for them. They are paying bit by bit, but not that much. Right now I’m just trying to keep away from them. I just want to live my life. I don’t want to even see them. But if it happens, I would say, look at me now—here, look at me now.I work as an agent’s assistant. I’m proud of myself now because now I have a job, I have a roof over my head, I have a car, I can do whatever I want. I’m building a house for my parents and I paid my siblings’ school tuition. My mom is always sick so I pay her medical fees—send her to a bigger hospital so she can get more tests. What I dream now is to be a registered nurse. I love helping people. With the help of God I’m going to do it and I’ll be a registered nurse. Everything is possible. I’m trying to work hard, save some money, go to school. I’m going to do it. I have to do it."," Christina Elangwe spent five years as a domestic slave in Washington DC, held by Cameroonians. Promised an American education and a babysitting job, she was tricked into leaving her family in Cameroon at the age of 17. Upon arrival in the US, she worked long hours for no money, was not sent to school, and were beaten and verbally abused.A man called Louis Etongwe helped Christina and two other women to escape, then took tapes of all three to Cameroon to show their parents and gather evidence against the traffickers. Christina’s captors received five years probation and were ordered to pay her $180,000 in back wages. So far she has received about $2000."
Christine,1997 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I was born a slave. I was born into sexual slavery in the state of Minnesota in the United States of America 29 years ago. I was born into a prostitution ring, a family of pimps and pornographers and prostitutes. The men pimped the women and girls and sometimes the boys. They made pornography. They sold us in whorehouses and at live sex shows. The men used me in pornography in basements, barns, houses, warehouses, isolated wooded areas, and public buildings. I come from the farms and suburbs and cities of the United States of America. I come from the strangled, suffocated, mangled voices of the raped, beaten, and starved. I was trafficked throughout the country, from state to state by car, by bus and by plane. I am not alone standing here before you today. I am not alone in my testimony, and I am not alone in spirit. I have many friends and acquaintances who have endured the tortures, rapes, beatings and degradations that pimps and johns hand out like candy. In prostitution rings women and girls are taught to be sexually submissive by men who refer to themselves as masters, by men who are so cowardly as to rape, beat, and starve women and girls. Women and girls raised in prostitution rings are sexually abused and otherwise tortured beginning in infancy. They are trained to be prostitutes, to sexually service men. The men are masters of torture and terror who are highly trained in torture techniques. Sometimes these pimp masters are doctors and dentists in the outside world. They rape girls as young as one and two years old. I was one such girl. I can tell you some of the things they did to me and other girls and women, but there is still much that I cannot speak of. These men gang rape us. They rape us with dogs. They rape us with knives and guns and beer bottles. They tie us down, chain us to bedposts and basement poles and each other. They make us eat shit and maggots and urine. They rape us with masks on their faces. They rape us in the name of Satan and Hitler and De Sade. They rape us in front of our mothers and grandmothers; they rape our grandmothers and mothers in front of us. They play games with us. They force us to choose who will live, which child or aunt or grandmother will live and which one will die. They hold mock executions. But sometimes they do kill us. You never know when they’re only joking, having some fun, or when they will pull the trigger. These men want us, the women and girls being raped, to feel responsible for their actions. They want us to feel like it is our fault that our mother, sister, daughter, grandmother is being destroyed in front of our eyes. They want us to dislike and distrust other women and girls. They want us to feel utterly powerless to stop them. They want us to feel dead, look dead, be dead. Above all else, they want us immobilized. They want to consume our lives, take our freedom with no resistance whatsoever… It is no small achievement to survive sexual slavery. Survivors are split into pieces, fragmented, broken, filled with despair, pain, rage, and sorrow. We have been hurt beyond belief. We are silent; we are numb. Our eyes see, our ears hear, but we do not tell. Our voices are non-existent, but even if they did exist, who would believe what we have to say? Who would listen? Who would care? We are dirty, ruined, despised, the whores of the earth. The men who use us throw us away. We are their garbage to piss on, to pile up in the corner. We are their property, they own us. The rest of you turn your backs, avert your eyes, pretend not to see, go on your way. You leave us to the predators. But we endure. We survive. It should be asked, why do these women stay alive? Sometimes, maybe much of the time, we don’t even know. Sometimes we do wish we were dead; we wish they would kill us; we can’t take it anymore. So why do we stay alive? We stay alive because we do not want them, the masters, to win. We stay alive because there is something we want, something we seek. We may not even know exactly what it is; we may not have ever experienced it. Or we may have known it only for a moment when something deep inside, deeper than even they can penetrate, stirred, and we felt alive, joyous, loved, at peace. We stay alive because we are women in search of our lives; we are women in search of freedom. I stayed alive because my belief in something better than what they offered was greater than their hatred and destruction. I stayed alive because I wanted to be free, more than anything, I wanted to be free. I wanted to live in a world of respect. I wanted to be free from them. I wanted their hands off me; I wanted their bodies off me and their dicks out of me. I wanted to not be sold. I wanted to not be bought. I wanted to not be raped and filmed and forced to smile and beg and plead for mercy. I wanted them to stop telling me who and what I was. I wanted to decide how I felt, what I thought, what I believed and who I loved. I wanted to eat the foods that I wanted to eat, run the way I wanted, be silly or thoughtful or serious. Quite simply, I wanted a life of autonomy and agency… It is only recently that I have been free from their sexual and physical abuse and to be honest, I don’t always know what to do with myself. I was beaten and raped, or at least verbally assaulted virtually every day of my life. The intensity of my emotions doesn’t match up to a normal life. Other survivors talk about this, too. Even though we have escaped, we live in the pimp’s world. We have flashbacks and night tremors. The pimps harass us, so we spend much of our time waiting, wondering when they’re going to hurt us again. Our worldview is one of war, constant rapes and beatings. We may escape, but we will always be isolated, we will never be part of society. We know too much, we have seen too much. The world does not want to acknowledge the truth of women’s lives… I escaped the pimps. It took me more than twenty years to do it, but I did it…I want to be free and I want my sisters to be free. And I will be free, and I will help women and girls escape or I will die trying. I have been in a sort of exile myself, on the run, surviving, remembering, waiting for them to kill me, gathering my strength. I have been outsmarting them, outfighting them, and speaking out to help other women and girls… It is difficult to know what to do with yourself when all you have known is chaos and destruction and the streets. You’re not good company, you’re not polite or talking or thinking about socially acceptable things. You’re talking about your life. You’re talking about the lives of other women and girls who are still held captive, who are still being hurt, who may not survive. You feel an urgency, a bond deeper than blood to the very women and girls they tried to make you hate…There are many women, strong women, brave women all across the world who are rising up to meet and to end the tidal wave of male violence against women. We escape and we organize and we educate and we go back down into the trenches to pull out our sisters. This is war, a battle of life and death. A battle that women must win…The pimps do not know state or national boundaries; women in battle must not know them either. We must be on the look out for each other. The brothels of the world house all the women of the world. We must go into those brothels, search one another out. We must break down the doors, beat back the pimps, and get out the women and girls held in cages. As I go back, back into the brothels and porn houses, I will be on the look out for you. I hope I will never find you there, but if do, you have my word that I will lend you my hand."," Though most of the slaves in the US have been trafficked from 35 or more countries, some are American citizens. Christine, of European and American Indian ancestry, was born and trafficked in Minnesota—which is currently a sex trafficking pipeline to larger cities, like Chicago. In fact, incidents of sex trafficking have been discovered in all 50 US states, involving victims born and raised in the US, as well as those trafficked from abroad. Girls as young as 12 years old are forced to have sex seven days a week, with 10-15 people a day, and meet a quota of $500-1000 a night. Most likely, almost half of people currently enslaved in the US are in the sex industry. As Christine notes, she was “one such girl”—trafficked by her family as a child. Her narrative lays out the gender dynamics of slavery, whereby traffickers and pimps attempt to divide and conquer women: “They rape us in front of our mothers and grandmothers; they rape our grandmothers and mothers in front of us…They want us to dislike and distrust other women and girls.” But Christine counters this attempt at division with her assertion of “a bond deeper than blood to the very women and girls they tried to make you hate,” and with her first-person plural voice: “we endure…we are women in search of freedom.”"
Jean-Robert,2002 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Haiti (trafficked from),Haiti (slavery location),"Anyone of you sitting here at this very moment can go to Haiti and ask for a child to live with you. All you need to do is to find a family with too many mouths to feed and promise that you will send the child to school and she is yours. You can treat her the same way slaves were treated under the French colonists. You do not have to make her a part of the family, learn her name, send her to school, provide her with health care, buy her clothes, give her affection, or treat her like a human being. You can make her sleep outside, torture her to death and dump her body in the trash, and no one will question you, and there will be no government investigation to find out the cause of death. In fact, the same specialized whips that were manufactured to torture the slaves during the 1700s can be purchased today on the streets of Port-au-Prince to torture children in domestic servitude. This practice is a violation of Haiti’s Constitution, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which passed the UN General Assembly in 1989, as well as the ILO’s Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999. One of the worst forms of abuse facing Haiti’s slave children is exclusion. Slave children in Haiti set tables for meals in which they cannot partake, fetch water that they cannot use for their own needs, are denied medical care when they are struck by illness, are forbidden to speak until spoken to, and stay outside when adults are inside. While these slave children are forced to be invisible, they must remain within the reach of their master’s voice. Otherwise, severe doses of physical punishment will ensue without mercy. This is a reality which provoked nightmares that consumed my own childhood and still haunt me well into my adulthood. At night, when I was a restavec child in Haiti, the adults installed themselves in the living room and I would go behind the house to watch television through the window screen, standing on a concrete block in the dark while mosquitoes feasted on my exposed legs and arms. I had to be constantly within the reach of the grown ups’ voices in case they wanted to be served a cold beverage from the refrigerator within their reach. I then remained out of sight until everyone was in bed, arranged my bedding under the kitchen table and woke before everyone would get out of bed. Today, in the year 2002, on any early morning in Port-au-Prince, children in tattered clothes are seen hand in hand with children in bright uniforms crossing the street. The ones in tattered clothes are restavecs who must return to their duties as domestic slaves after escorting their counterparts to school. This daily exclusion from any community or family often leaves no visible scars but the trauma lasts a lifetime. These children all too frequently become victims of the abusive and institutionalized practice of domestic servitude. Since their most basic rights—to a family’s love and protection, health and education—are denied, restavecs are invisible children, observers instead of participants in their own society. As a slave child in Port-au-Prince, my day began at 5.30 in the morning and ended when the last adult went to sleep. I had to sweep the yard, water the plants, fill the tub for everyone’s bath, empty and wash the chamber pots, hand wash diapers, boil baby bottles, wash the car twice a day, dust the furniture every day, serve people drinks in the front yard every evening, wash people’s feet every evening, run errands, hand wash women’s monthly napkins, fetch water from afar, be borrowed by the family’s friends, and cook my own food. I worked seven days a week with no pay and no time to play. I was also excluded from all family activities such as meals, birthdays, attending school and church, Mother’s Day, Christmas, New Year’s celebrations, weddings, first communions, and even funerals. I could not speak unless spoken to. For any minor infraction, such as not answering quickly enough when my name was called, I was beaten without mercy. Like all restavec children, I was only an observer rather than a participant in my Haitian society and culture. It was by a twist of fate that I came to the United States. In 1970, the family that owned me moved to the United States and later sent for me to resume the same duties that I used to perform in Haiti. My birth certificate was purchased on the black market, and I was listed as my virtual owner’s son only to fool the United States Immigration officials. In New York, my situation improved a great deal. My owners made sure that I wore shoes and clean clothes to hide the fact that they had a slave child living with them. However, by having to address everyone as Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle, they made sure that I did not forget my status as a restavec. I no longer had to wash their feet, fetch water or hand-wash feminine napkins every month. But I continued my duties of washing dishes, cleaning the house, setting the table, babysitting three children and washing the car. One day, a family friend who knew me in Haiti came to visit and told the family that it was against the law in the United States not to send a minor to school. I was taken to Spring Valley High School in New York and placed in the ninth grade. I was about 16 years old and I had the equivalent of a third grade education, with no English proficiency. When the family realized that their children and I would be attending the same school, I was shown the door to fend for myself. However, the facts that I was attending school, participating in extra-curricular activities and eating in the cafeteria with my fellow students made me an integral part of American society. For the first time in my life, I could express my needs, feelings, and opinions. After four years in high school, I graduated and joined the United States Army for three years. I then completed my university studies and eventually wrote my autobiography Restavec, simply to raise international consciousness to the plight of Haiti’s more than 300,000 slave children. By looking at me, you cannot tell that I never had a childhood. It was stolen and the accomplice is Haiti’s institutionalized practice of domestic servitude. Since it can never be recovered, I will feel its absence for the rest of my life. To give you an idea, what it is like to have never had a childhood, let me read parts of the foreword to my book that my wife Cindy wrote: Four months ago, while I was in Haiti to distribute clothes to street children who once were slaves, a Haitian acquaintance invited me to spend a weekend as a guest in his family’s house. It was a two-story yellow and white brick house in an upper-class suburb in Port-au-Prince, protected by an eight-foot wall and a large red iron gate. I was awakened from a light sleep at around four in the morning by the crowing of roosters. I went to sleep again, and I opened my eyes to daylight when I heard a noise coming from the yard. It was quarter to six. I got out of bed and I looked down from the balcony. It was the sound of Celita’s large broom sweeping the cement yard. Everyone else in the house was still in bed. Celita was an 11 year old slave girl who had been living with the family for the past two years. Her mother, who lived in the countryside, had handed Celita to the host family because she was no longer able to provide her daughter with what every child needs: three meals a day and a decent school. Celita was dressed in an oversized, sleeveless t-shirt and a skirt. Her small budding breasts were visible from the side each time she leaned forward. She cleaned up after the dog, washed the yard with buckets of water and dried it with a rubber squeegee. Then she repeatedly carried water from a bucket upstairs to flush toilets and to fill-up bathtubs. After each of the four adults and one child bathed, she set the table and made a trip to the bakery, while the cook prepared breakfast. As everyone ate, Celita stood near the doorway with her hands behind her back, waiting for requests to pass the butter, the sugar, the salt, or whatever someone did not care to reach for. After breakfast, Celita cleared the table and ate the leftover food sitting on a cement block near the gate. Then she washed dishes and went upstairs to make the beds, dust the furniture and mop the rooms. While doing these tasks, she was interrupted with several requests, “Celita fetch my slippers, Celita bring me a comb, Celita bring my purse.” Besides being the doer and the fetcher of everything for everyone, Celita also cared for the family’s bright eyed nine-year old daughter Maida, whose face looked healthy and was always ready to smile. She was often praised and affectionately touched by her mother, father and grandfather, who spoke to her only in French. A large picture of her first communion in a gold frame graced the small coffee table in the living room. Maida was Catholic, she had toys, and attended an expensive private school. Celita was a dark skinned child with a thin, scarred and hardened face that did not seem able to smile. Her eyes were deep and dull. She was often criticized and threatened with the back of a hand. She had no picture of herself in the house. She did not go to school and her owners never took her to any church. She had no religion. She entertained Maida instead of playing with her. She obeyed Maida’s every command. As her owner begun to back his brown car out of the driveway, he honked his horn and Celita ran at full speed to open the heavy iron gate that kept the house and everyone inside safe from intruders. As soon as Celita finished her other house-cleaning duties, she sat on a cement block and began to wash by hand a huge pile of clothes. And again, she was constantly interrupted, “Where is Celita, come wash this pot, Celita come dry the floor, Celita come flush the toilet, Celita come set the table.” By late afternoon, the brown car returned again and the horn was honked again. Celita rushed to the front yard and pulled opened the heavy iron gate. The car entered, and she pushed the gate shut. By late evening, the family sat on the front porch relaxing in the warm tropical breeze. Celita carried a bucket of water to the side of the house where the dog was tied. She bathed there, changed to an oversize dress and remained out of sight but within the reach of everyone’s voice. Soon the requests began again until everyone went to bed. “Celita bring me a glass of water, Celita fetch my slippers.” Celita’s sole purpose was to slave. Her right to be a child ended the very moment she walked through the red iron gate. Her masters’ comfort was her hell. Haiti’s institutionalized practice of using children as domestic slaves violates every article of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which passed the UN General Assembly unanimously, along with Haiti’s ratification in 1989. Haiti is now making preparations to celebrate its 200th year of independence in 2004. Leaders of many nations will be invited to attend the ceremony, and every Haitian will take to the streets to celebrate, except the children forced into domestic slavery."," Jean-Robert Cadet, a former child slave in Haiti, confronts the problem of freedom. The slave experience is not over for him: “nightmares…haunt me well into my adulthood…the trauma lasts a lifetime.” His childhood can “never be recovered,” and he will “feel its absence for the rest of my life.” The narrative quotes his wife’s observation that sometimes the “reality from decades ago is up on us again.""As a restavek (Creole for “stay with”), Jean-Robert was one of thousands of Haitian children who are sent by their poor rural families to stay with wealthier families. Supposedly they will be treated like one of the family and enrolled in school, in exchange for domestic labor. But this rarely happens. Instead they work 14 hours a day for no compensation and are frequently abused. Slavery was supposedly abolished in Haiti after the revolt of 1794-1804, when African slaves fought and overthrew their French masters, and declared the colony of Saint-Domingue on the island of Hispaniola an independent republic. But as Haiti’s economy collapsed, and the country became the poorest nation in the western hemisphere, the restavek system exploded. The Haitian government estimates that 90,000-120,000 children are enslaved as restaveks, but the UN puts this number at 300,000—or one in ten children in Haiti. Some are as young as four years old, and 75 percent are girls, many of whom are sexually exploited."
Miguel,2005 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour Debt bondage,Mexico (trafficked from) Debt bondage,United States (slavery location),"I come from Mexico. I have one son and he has cancer. It costs a lot for the medicine and treatment, and the government helps out but they can only give so much treatment and it still costs a lot. The wages in Mexico are so low and I wasn’t earning enough there. It’s maybe $40-60 for a whole week of work. I thought if I could go to the United States and earn $6-7 an hour, maybe in a whole day I can earn $48-50. And with that, I could be earning in three or four days more than I can earn in a whole week in Mexico. I could be sending that home. It would help sustain the family and help pay for my son’s sickness. My dream was to work like in Mexico but not with the same wage that I get there. In Mexico if you don’t like working with one guy you can change. When I came to the United States, I thought I could change jobs if I didn’t like one. But it was a really tough decision to come to the United States, because you have to cross the desert and I heard that they kill people there. I gathered together some money, and borrowed maybe 3000 pesetos. Here that is not much money—$300. We decided together that we’d go, five or six of us. We had more courage to go as five or six together. In a larger group we had the strength to say: “Yeah, we’re going to do this.” I went to the border of Mexico and the United States and into Arizona, walking. We really had no idea where we were going or how to get there, we were just kind of walking in the direction of the house of the guy who gives rides to Florida. In the desert we spent about eight days looking for the house, and we looked for a boss who could send money to the guy who would drive us. Then we could pay him back by working. From the 21st of February to the 14th of March was the time that it took to get from Mexico to the border, to cross the border, to wait around in Arizona, to get a ride and then to come here. Ramiro Ramos is the one who sent the money and arranged for us to come here. We didn’t know of him, but we just asked around for somebody who would give us a ride across and who we could work for; someone who could pay for our ride and then we could pay them back. Supposedly you can find these people. If you just ask around people will know them, and so that’s what we did. It wasn’t a direct way to get to Florida. We had to stop and wait and change. When we arrived, we hadn’t eaten for three days. We arrived in front of a shop, 14 of us. The driver said: “You wait here, I’m going to look for the boss.” He went off, but he didn’t find him. He came back and said: “Uh, don’t move, you just stay here. There’s no problem with Immigration or Border Patrol. You just wait here.” This was my first time in the United States and I was afraid of Immigration. Then the guy spoke on the phone—it was hard to talk to this guy cause he was always on the phone. Another guy came up to us and said: “OK, OK, so we’re all here to work, right? You’re all here to work.” He told us about the jobs. He was one of the Ramos family. He said: “Do you have any money to pay me for the ride? Here’s the telephone, call your family members in the United States and tell them to pay me for the ride.” I knew I didn’t have any family here. “If I had family here,” I said, “I would have come with them. I wouldn’t have taken your ride, and I wouldn’t have to owe any money.” That when he first threatened us. He said: “Look, you’re going to work here, and it’s hard work. You’ve got to work hard, you’ve got to be motivated. You’ve got to cut oranges and you’ve got to harvest those oranges, you’ve got to use a big, heavy knife. If any of you assholes try to leave without paying back your ride, that’s when I’m going to really fuck you up.” He said that we can take something to eat but whatever we took we would have to pay for. Then Ramiro Ramos came and said: “Don’t take much food, and hurry up because we’ve got to get to work tomorrow.” He took us to a little ranch and we started to get more threats. I was with a friend and he asked about a television. Ramos said: “Shut up and don’t talk about TV. This isn’t a place to watch TV. This is a place to work and if you’re going to complain about it we’re going to kill you and throw your ass into the pond.” We had to work but we didn’t have any social security cards or insurance, so we weren’t really sure what this work was going to be like. We didn’t work for money by the hour, but by the bucket. It wasn’t really a bucket, it was a really large container that we had to fill with oranges and carry over to a large bin. We had to fill one of those bathtub-size things at least ten times and this took at least an hour. There were so many oranges and we had to pick up only the really nice ones. I was working from really early in the morning to really late at night. We could only fill maybe three or four tubs and that that would get us maybe $28. We had to pay not just the ride money but rent and some taxes. They took it from our check, and charged us money at the shop for cashing the check. He would never take us to another bank. There was almost nothing left after they took out everything. One day it was only $20 and what am I supposed to do with $20? How can I send that when they charge money to send it? We started talking to each other about what to do and decided we were not earning anything. It was a misery wage—the same as it would be in Mexico. There was this time when a guy was talking about going. We saw him go toward the Cash and Carry supermarket and they saw him too. We heard one of them outside of our apartment talking on the telephone, saying: “We’re going to get that motherfucker. We’re going to get him and we’re going to throw him into the pond with the alligators and kill him.” There were about eight of us in the house and we knew he meant what he said. Those words are serious because that’s how they work. The words have meaning. We knew that they can hit us hard or shoot us with a gun. Around 40 guys who were working for Ramos were there watching us. They were everywhere. Four of us tended work in the same place in the fields and we started noticing this new guy. He came in 15 days after we arrived. He was an older guy, maybe 47 years old. He was always tired and always threatened by them. He said he wanted to sit down and take a rest, and asked one of the guys watching if he could just take one day off. The guy said: “We don’t want any fucking assholes to be resting here. This is a place of work and if you want to go rest you can get the hell out of here.” It made me feel so sad to see this old man so tired. He wanted to rest and he was being forced to work. We had to take all these threats and we couldn’t say anything against them. I felt like a slave from the moment I arrived. We couldn’t pay for the ride and they started to threaten us. It was horrible. We were piled in a dorm, three beds on top of each other, six in a room. The person on top had to jump over all of us just to get to the floor. From the 14th of March to the 14th of April we hadn’t had a single day of rest. Even when it was raining we had to work. We had to work every Saturday and Sunday. We were afraid because the bosses kept threatening us but we still had to endure all this stuff. We were talking about getting out somehow but we couldn’t do it in the middle of the night or even in the morning because they get up really early to start working and could easily find us down the road in the car. When they found us they were sure to kill us. I was thinking about my family—that’s why I came here, to send them money. So I said: “One day we’re going to have the opportunity.” Around that time a couple of people arrived. One was a Mexican, his name was Lucas Benitez, and the other was the other was an American. Her name was Laura Jamino. They asked us: “how are y’all doing here? What’s the situation like here?” And none of us wanted to say because we thought maybe they’re spies of the boss. In Mexico you learn from your parents to kind of lay low and assess the situation because otherwise you end up dead. But there was another group who were there before we arrived, and they called out to them that we were getting threats, they’re not paying us wages, we don’t have papers. They started to open up, saying things like: “I’ve been here for six months but they’re not even paying me enough for the ride that I have to repay.” I didn’t say anything to Lucas and Laura because I didn’t really trust them but I did say: “Give me your card.” I was the only one who took a card. A week before Easter it happened. I said: “This is the day we’ve got to leave. We’re working here and we’re not earning anything and they keep threatening us.” I was really scared because that same day two people had disappeared. I said: “Why don’t two of us try to go and two stay behind? Then two can give a shout out to the others if something happens, like Ramos comes.” Two of the other guys went to make a phone call to Laura who decided to try to meet us at a hotel across the street. But the brother of Ramos came in and said: “I don’t want any of this shit going on. If I catch any of you motherfuckers messing around I’m going to kick all your asses.” We were all scared and thinking about what to do. I said: “I can’t take it this. I’ve got to go. Now is our time to leave. I can’t take this slavery anymore.” I was scared and surprised at the same time. I grabbed some scissors and stuck them in my boot. I thought, if any of them come I’m going to stick those scissors right in his neck and they’re going to have to call the police. And that’s it. We were all really scared and then a car pulled up and I saw Lucas in there. I said: “I’m going to get in that car. I’m going to get the hell out of here.” I knew I had to jump in that car. I knew that this was my chance to leave. As soon as I jumped in he drove off in a big circle really fast. I was afraid but I knew that in Mexico there’s a lot of violence but we still live in a free society there. So if there are rights that we have there then we must have those rights here too. He brought us all the way here to Immokalee. The coalition was the one that freed us. If it wasn’t for that, who knows what would’ve happened? Maybe we would’ve been killed or left there stranded, away from our families. Now things are different. I have permission to work, and I’m working eight hours a day but for a boss who pays me. I work eight hours, no more, no less, and it’s my own will. I know if I want a day off he’s going to give it to me. And I know if I want to work ten hours I can work ten hours, but not because I’m being forced to. My wage is really satisfying and my son is doing really well. He’s getting his medicine and I send what I can. It’s still not a lot but I send what I can. I’m still afraid for my family. It’s been four years since I saw them. America is beautiful but it’s not with my family. It’s a scary thing if you come here illegally. If you try to work you could end up in the same situation as a slave. I think the world should know that these things happen."," Miguel’s narrative marks a clear turning-point when he knew he could remain in bondage no longer: “A week before Easter it happened.” He told other workers: “Now is our time to leave.” Miguel had arrived in the US from Mexico in 2001, and ended up as a slave in a labor camp run by the Ramos family in Lake Placid, Florida, after being recruited in Arizona. He and several others were transported to Florida and then told they owed $1000 each for transportation. The Ramoses also deducted from their weekly pay for food, rent for substandard camp housing, and work equipment. Miguel sometimes ended up with only $20 a day, and had no control over records of payment and credit. His employers were armed with guns, watched for workers trying to escape, and cut off access to the outside world. Relatives of the Ramoses owned the stores where workers were taken to shop.Miguel reached the turning-point from slavery to freedom in 2001 with the help of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a community-based worker organization of over 2000 members in Immokalee, Florida’s largest farmworker community. Between 1997 and 2000, CIW helped end three modern-day slavery operations, resulting in freedom for over 500 workers, and in 2001 it began investigating the Ramoses. In November 2002, three members of the Ramos family were convicted of conspiracy to hold 700 workers in involuntary servitude. In May 2004 they were sentenced to a total of 31 years and nine months in federal prison."
Munni,2004 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"My name is Munni Devi. I’m 35 to 40 years old. I have four children, two boys and two girls. I’ve been working in the quarry for a long, long time, many years. Maybe 20 years, maybe more. I’m not sure. My husband died while working there and now I have to work there myself. Life is tough. I’ve taken a loan because of which I’m a slave to the person from whom I took it. And now the situation is getting even worse. I’m in debt. I can’t work that much and he threatens to throw me out of my house. My poor son is just running from pillar to post to organize things. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’ve been working under the same contractor and I’ve taken one loan and now it seems to have doubled to become two loans. I’m not really earning too much and my debt is increasing. My original loan was for 9000 rupees [$200] and I’ve been trying to repay it for long long time. It just seems to be increasing. I took it for the marriage of my daughter. I’m not paid any money or salary except once in a while when the lorry comes to be loaded I’m paid about 400 or 500 rupees [$9-11] depending on his mood. The lorry only comes when all of us are able to break down the hard rocks into tiny pieces. As and when the tiny pieces are ready, the lorry turns up. I would say the process of breaking hard rocks into tiny pebbles takes about 15 days. I am forced to work. If I have something important to do at home, I am forced to work. Even if I’m sick, I’m made to work. They don’t look after my expenses, my food. There’s no nourishment coming from that side whatsoever. When I’m not working my loan amount is escalating monthly. I have been threatened, verbally that is. The threat has been that he’s going to throw me out of my house. He keeps coming over once in a while and saying he’ll throw me out, put a lock on my door so I can’t use my own house. We’re trying to do something about it. Once when he did come earlier we all got together, abused him and made sure he went out of the village. But I’m not sure how long that tactic will work. I am scared. I am scared because at least in the daytime I have my children around me and it’s possible they will protect me. But then that’s the daytime. In the night when my children are not around me, I’m more vulnerable and somebody could just come and do anything. Beat me up, thrash me. I think I must have paid about half the loan by now, and half might still be due. But then again that’s not taking into account the fact that he may be cheating me. If that’s the case, I’m not sure how much of my loan has been repaid. What he’s doing is not right. I don’t know what the law says but I don’t think it’s right. I have no choices. Where will I go? What will I do? This is my house. This is my home. This is the only way I can survive because I have no money and that is all I can do. I can’t run away. How will I run? Where will I run? What will I run towards? I’m here. I spend my whole day here."," Debt bondage is the most common form of modern slavery. Found predominantly in South Asia and South America, it occurs when a person pledges their labor or that of a child for an indefinite period of time in return for financial credit. There are millions of bonded laborers in India. Debts arise from two main sources: an urgent crisis such as illness, injury, or famine, and the need to pay for death rites or marriage celebrations. Technically, bonded laborers can end their servitude once the debt is repaid, but this rarely occurs. A combination of low wages and high interest rates makes it impossible to repay the initial debt, and the debt usually increases because the employer deducts payment for equipment and living expenses, or charges fines for faulty work. According to India’s laws, families can simply walk away from debt and bondage, but this is usually impossible: if families try to leave, the slaveholder’s thugs retaliate with beatings, rape and forced eviction. If a family survives the beatings, they are free to starve. Without access to jobs, health care, community support or credit, independence is impossible to sustain, and they re-enter debt bondage. Munni Devi narrated her story while enslaved as a bonded laborer in the rock quarries of Uttar Pradesh, India. She finds the idea of escape impossible. But the day before Munni told her story in November 2004, Ramphal (an abolitionist and former quarry slave in Uttar Pradesh) explained of slaves like Munnii: “We keep…showing them…the life we lead now, and they’re keen to get out of bondage, so it’ll happen. It’s just a question of time.”"
Oumoulkhér,2006 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"I am Oumoulkhér Mint Mahmoud. I have been a slave all my life. I was a good slave. A slave who obeys her master is a good slave. I am still a slave, I am looking for my freedom. Since I have been here, with SOS, I feel peaceful. I don’t care what my master thinks—I don’t think about my master. When Selek’ha was taken from me, the master said he would bring her back, but he didn’t. I cried and cried. I had three other children at the time, I had nowhere to go. My son Hamit, was given to a Marabout in exchange for a remedy to cure my master’s son who was sick. Hamit escaped and I have not seen him since. My son Mbarack, the master said he died of thirst whilst looking after the camels. I don’t know if it’s true, but they said he was dead. My daughter Behuja Habah was rented out by my master for money. They said she ran away too.I have spent my life working. I tried to run away when I was younger but they always found me in the bush and brought me back. When Selek’ha came for me, I refused to go, because I am an old lady and useless, but then the master’s wives started to insult her and Selek’ha was crying so it made me angry and I decided to leave. Selek’ha has promised to look after me. Now I can rest."," Oumoulkhér Mint Mahmoud was born into slavery in Mauritania. Her daughter Selek’ha escaped and returned with the human rights organization SOS Slaves, to seek the release of Oumoulkhér. But Oumoulkhér initially refused to leave her master, and it was only when Selek’ha began to cry, in response to insults from the master’s wives, that she got “angry and…decided to leave.” Oumoulkhér’s narrative oscillates between assertions that freedom remains out of reach (“I am still a slave”) and acknowledgements that she is now free (“I was a good slave”)."
Rama,2004 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I will absolutely not let my parents send any of my brothers to the loom. When it comes to the loom owners, I was badly beaten. They did not provide any of the facilities they talked about in the village. In fact, they made us work day and night on the loom. I will make sure that none of my brothers get caught in the same trap again. Before I was taken I did not go to school. I would take the cattle of my neighbors for grazing. I would have fun. We would go in a large group of boys. We would just let the cattle graze while we had fun and went and did our thing. In the village I had five brothers, my mother and my sister. I was in the village when a man came and offered food, clothing, shelter, money. My parents sent me even though I didn’t want to come. I didn’t know what was happening to me—where I would land up. I was very scared. The journey took a long time. I didn’t know how to weave but I was taught by being beaten up repeatedly—they beat me up each time I made a mistake. I was beaten with the wooden portion of the knife. I wasn’t allowed to go out to play outside, and had no friends. The food was really bad, stale and two days old. I didn’t like it at all. I always had hope that I would be rescued but nobody came while I was there. Once I got a call from father. He asked if I was alright. I lied and said I was ok. I didn’t want my father to worry about me. I would think about running away every night. One morning something snapped. I took my blanket and ran for my life. I jumped on a tractor and it took me to a place I didn’t know. A woman sheltered me for the night and sent me to her father’s house. The owners of the loom chased me. I was lucky and lived with my parents for the next two years. The loom owner actually came to the house but didn’t see me. My brother tried to escape before me—he was caught and beaten. What I have learned at the Ashram, I will take back home. How to behave, not only with myself but also with others. That is what I want to take home, interaction with other people. I can read now a little bit. When I do go back, I intend to enroll in school and learn a whole lot more. The happiness and joy that I have found at the Ashram may never come again. I don’t think I can find the joy back home. I will go but I know I will have to come back here one day. Now there are no thoughts about running away in my mind. I am just so happy here on my daily basis. I just think about my work and what tomorrow will bring. The work I do here I want to continue when I go home. I want to work as an electrician.I want to tell the government that these kids exist. It’s time for you to take these children out of the loom. And it’s not so difficult. All you need to do is surround the loom on all sides, come in and take the children. That’s all you have to do."," There are hundreds of thousands of children trapped in India’s carpet industry. Most of India’s carpets are woven in Uttar Pradesh, where the majority of workers are low-caste Hindu boys. Some are lured into bondage by agents’ promises to their parents that they will receive good wages, and others are kidnapped. The boys are forced to work for no pay, for 10-18 hours a day, seven days a week. They are beaten, tortured, branded, kept half fed and half clad, and are usually made to sleep in the loom shed.

Rambho,2004 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My name is Rambho Kumar and I am 11 years old. I used to work at home and I also used to play and roam around with the kids living nearby. A man named Shankar and the owner of the loom came one day to my house and gave 700 rupees [$15] for me. They told my parents that they’re going to educate me and make me do some work. I didn’t want to go to the looms. I wanted to stay at home. But there was no money at home for us to eat so my mother told me to go. I was crying and saying that I didn’t want to go there. They said that they’re going to give me money. He’ll send money home and then after some time I can come back. But after a very long time he told me that I’m not going to be able to go back home ever. After two days I reached the loom and they made me sit. They told me to learn how to use the loom. My hand got cut and the owner and his brother shut my eyes and put my finger in boiling oil and said: “Now it’s all right, now you get back to work.” If I made any mistake, the loom owner used to take a stick and beat me with that. I kept asking the loom owner when I would go to school, and he kept telling me: “There is no school for you. You will spend time weaving carpets.”I used to work from four in the morning till 11 in the night. I wasn’t allowed to play or roam around or anything. At about ten in the morning we used to get our first meal which was not good, and then I would go back to weaving the carpets till about ten at night. And that was all we did during the day: weaving carpets, eating food, and going to sleep. I was there for one year. I wanted to go back home. I always used to want to get away. The owner used to tell us: “If the police ever come, run away before they can catch you.” So I knew that when the police came I’d be taken away from there. When I saw them coming I was very happy. As soon as they came, the owner and his father and his brother and all the other people ran away. About ten of us were surrounded by the police. Six of us ran away but four of us were brought to the Ashram. When I came here I liked it because you get time to eat, you get time to play, to study. I like studying the most.I haven’t seen my mother for the last 13 months and I miss my family a lot. My father has passed away. We put 6000 rupees [$130] into expenses for his treatment but still he passed away. Now we don’t even have a place to stay over there in the village. I want to help my mother find a house. I want to go to my village and be a guard there, and I think I’ll be able to study and earn money. And I won’t let anybody go to the looms even by mistake. I’ll tell them: “They hit you and they beat you.” I would not let them go there, ever. If the children make any mistakes they beat them up. I won’t let them go there."," There are hundreds of thousands of children trapped in India’s carpet industry.

Ramphal,2004 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"My name is Ramphal. I am 27 or 28 years old. I was born a bonded laborer, and I remember my earliest childhood days. Way back, we were farmers. We all worked in the field, and we were bonded laborers under the contractor. Then we came to the stone quarry and we became slaves. But there is actually no difference between being a bonded laborer and being a slave. It is the same thing. When my grandparents were born, they were slaves. When my parents were born, they were slaves. When I was born, I was born a slave, and the situation really didn’t change until recently—about five or six years ago when my son was born, he was born a slave. And when I went to prison, my daughter was born a slave. When I say I was a slave, or that my parents were slaves, I want you to understand what I’m talking about. If I wanted to cycle on the road, the moment I stepped onto my cycle I would be stopped and thrashed. The reason? I didn’t get the slave owner’s permission to use the road. If I walked out of my house, if I wanted to sit somewhere, if I wanted to eat, if I wanted to drink, any single action at any point in time, anything that I wanted to do, I required permission. That’s what I mean when I say I was a slave. Freedom of movement was something I didn’t know existed. And it was not just me. My mother, my father, my grandparents had to live through this generation after generation. It was deep in the psyche. But it was only when we thought about it and became aware, that we realized that we were slaves. The realization came when we looked at the contractor and saw we did all the hard work. We were responsible for loading the trucks. For all the stones we would load onto the truck we would get the measly sum of 250-300 rupees [$5-6] and he would pocket the rest of the 1500 rupees [$30]. At no time were we free to do what we wanted to do or to make our own choices. That’s when we realized we were slaves. Each time I think back and look at the life that I led in that village, my heart is filled with grief and with sadness. There was just no relationship between the slave owner and us. It was a matter of their mood or their fancy. They would just pick up anyone on the road, anyone cycling, someone’s brother, someone’s son, myself, anyone. Any single individual at any point in time could be just picked up and beaten, no rhyme or reason. My mother, my sister, somebody else’s mother, sister, wife, daughter. It made no difference to them. There was no feeling within them that: “This is my employee, this person works for me.” Almost that you weren’t human. That’s the level of torture for us, the indignity that we suffered from. Understand the fact that everyone was under their control. The slave owners had complete authority. There was not a moment when they would think: “Oh my God, look who’s sitting there, a person.” We weren’t individuals. You have to understand that. Whatever they wanted to do, they could do. We were in total fear of them. The level of violence against the females was always very high. There were always the situations when we, the men, would go to work. We would go to load the lorries and very often the slave owners would just come inside and do as they pleased with the females. There was nothing you could do. An incident happened in a district not very far from here. An eight-year-old girl was sitting in a house and these landlords came and they just set fire to the house. The girl died. They could do what they wanted to do. As simple as that. The level of fear, the level of constant control that we were under was so high  that we were just shaking each time anyone would approach us. There was just no dream. Anything else was an impossibility.     Now the situation has changed. All my children are being born free. They are free men. What happened was that the level of torture and harassment was escalating. There was no end; it kept going on and on.And into this environment people from the municipality came in and talked to us about forming a committee. We got together as an awareness group. Then people from Sankalp came from outside to talk to us. Committees forming made the contractors jittery and because of their jitteriness, they began labeling us as rebel leaders and politicians. The contractors even harassed the Sankalp people and beat them up a couple of times. But somehow something had sunk in at some level. When Sankalp left, about ten mothers thought together and started talking. There was a thought process about how we should get together and form an organization, this informal committee. The thought processes got conceptualized and formalized, and the entire village joined in unanimously. There was a rally in Falatna and a lot of us went there—almost the entire village got together and went there. There, a lot of issues were raised. It wasn’t an easy rally but as a result there was this feeling spreading among the people, that—”Yes something was happening, something was possible.” These ripples were moving over everyone. After that, the people of Sankalp would come in repeatedly. They would talk to us, awareness spread, and on the basis of what they told us and what we thought among ourselves, we started walking along a path. A direction was shown and we were moving toward it. Then there was a huge meeting in Ramgarh. A large number of people came. The villages adjoining our village flocked together. The meeting came at a time when the ripples were escalating so there was an expectation in the air that something was going to give, something would happen. That was the feeling that was prevalent among everyone. There was electricity in the air. The slave owners in turn also knew that the meeting was going to happen so they were prepared. Violence was what they had on their agenda. We had an inkling that they knew. We had all assembled together, about 5000 villagers. We had a meeting peacefully. But as the meeting was about to terminate, we noticed that about ten of the slave owners were circling around the entire congregation. The meeting began to disperse. Some people went to nearby shops to buy stuff, and the slave owners came to these shops and used their bare hands, their shoes, their slippers and randomly began to beat these shop owners and the people buying provisions. There was uproar; people were screaming and shouting. We all turned around and came back to check what was happening. But even then, violence did not erupt. People were asking: “What’s up? What’s happening? What’s wrong? Why are you beating us up?” Then the entire flock of turned around and came back towards this commotion. Now there were 5000 people. A discussion began between the elders of the mob and the slave owners, but the slave owners took pistols and shot them in the air. When the mob heard these shots in the air, that’s when all controls broke loose. Now they were scared, scared for their life and also angry. The mob lost its cool and completely surrounded these ten people. There were sticks being used, blows being thrown around and basically violence erupted. In the chaos and confusion the chief of the slave owners died, and about four others were wounded. The moment the mob realized that death of someone had taken place, calmness resumed. We all congregated again and moved slowly towards the police station in Bara but there were over 5000 of us and we were on foot. We were walking around the mountain which is a longer winding path so by the time we reached the police station, the slave owners had already reached there. Since their version of the story had reached the police first, they refused to lodge any of our complaints or accept our story. We made a silent protest. We just sat, we just sat on the doorstep of the police station and refused to move, hoping that this demonstration would compel them to register our complaint. In the meantime, the slave owners who had been injured had been rushed to the Allahabad Hospital. Over there, in front of a doctor they named about eight or ten villagers they could think of or who were popular as the people responsible for the mob attack. On the basis of the testimony that the police got from the slave owners, they took about eight of us and they put us in prison for six months. The families of my fellow inmates were left high and dry. There was no one to look after them. I was at least safe. I was in prison, there was no fear of any landowner, any slave owner. But at the same time all of the fellow mob members were severely harassed by slave owners. They were under constant pressure. I had no hope that I would see the earth again, that I would be free, but after six months, I was released. My release was a combined effort of a lot of people—the members of Sankalp, my self-help group, fellow villagers, people from other villages. They all tried very hard, spoke to a lot of officials, gathered money for my bail application. Sankalp moved every single rock to get me freedom. But afterwards the slave owners had banned my reentry into my own village. Right about that time of the Ramgarh meeting, a girl was burnt alive by the landlord for no rhyme or reason. It’s all connected, these incidents that took place one after the other. And as a result of that, the houses were burned by the landlord. When the looting happened, eight of us men were in prison. Houses were looted; the women weren’t protected; the men weren’t there. Every household item that you can think of—clothes, suitcases, food, baskets, water—was completely destroyed, burned, looted. In all 40 houses, not one needle and thread could be found. Gone, all gone. That was a bumper year, there was a great amount of crop. Every house, no matter how poor, had about ten or 20 quintals of rice and wheat all stocked up. Even that if the crops had failed for the next two years we would have survived. But all of that, every single speck of grain was gone. You think we would have complained to the police, taken some legal action, but they were hopeless. They had taken so much money as bribes that they were standing while the houses were looted, just standing and watching. We all moved to land close to my former village. The belief was so strong among all of us, this feeling of brotherhood that we now share, that we all actually formed this entire village just by ourselves, and we named it Azad Nagar—”the land which is free.” This means so much to us, the fact that it self-proclaimed, that we all led a march one day. If you just stretch your eyes one day, you might catch a glimpse of it. I’m so happy with this new life that I’ve got. It gives me so much joy—the fact that I can control my own mind, my own thoughts, my own movements. I can’t even look back at my earlier existence. Now we are in control, to do what we want, when we want, how we want. I had taken a loan of about 5000 rupees [$100] but today I’m a debt-free man. The work is the same, but there’s a fundamental difference. Earlier I could not control the hours I wanted to work, when I went to work, how I wanted to work. Now I can. Before, if the vehicle came, I would load it right there and then, no matter what I was doing. Now I can go and work in the mountain and work for as long as I want. If I don’t want to work I can come back and rest. I can go outside the village, go meet someone, talk to someone. I’m master of my own mind, my own destiny. That’s a big difference. I can do what I want to do. I am free. The very fact that I’m sitting here and I’m able to take time from my hectic day’s work speaks about today. Today I’m free to not only live as I want to live buthope for a better future. My dream is now to start some kind of business, to have earnings and savings for myself and for a better future for my children. The dream is very big. I’m a little scared that it might not come true. I want my child to study, to become big, to do something, to be successful in all that he does. It’s so grand, so big a dream. I have dream that tomorrow we’ll be able to continue the unity we have waked up and take this unity towards a more progressive future for us and everyone in my village. Ever since we have obtained our freedom, we’ve talked to the other people who are still slaves. We keep telling them that all we want is for them to live an independent life like we do, and that’s what we want for anyone and everyone who’s under slavery. We are trying. I am trying and all the fellow volunteers of Sankalp are also trying very hard to get them out of bondage. When I was a slave, I never dreamt I could go to Delhi, and now I have. In fact, I’ve been put in charge of all the running around that has to be done between the big cities. Whenever I go to these places, I learn, I become aware, and I come back and I impart this awareness to my fellow villagers and also to the other people who are working in bondage. We meet them and talk with them and they listen. It’s not like they don’t. They do. But then they forget, or they’re too scared of the landowners. That doesn’t matter. We keep telling them, showing them our life, the life we lead now, and they’re keen to get out of bondage, so it’ll happen. It’s just a question of time.My life today is so much better that all I can think about is coming generations—they will be even better than mine. I don’t know exactly what will change, but there will be a change. That’s my wish. That’s my desire. We are doing this in spite of being free. You know our motto for the villages? Just like we are able to break this hard hard rock with the hammer, any enemy is going to be shattered because of the unity that we now have."," In 2000, some of the 220 residents of Sonebarsa, a quarrying village in Uttar Pradesh, India, revolted against their slaveholders. About 40 families lived in Sonebarsa, all of them Kols, an ethnic group near the bottom of India’s steep ladder of caste and discrimination, and all locked into hereditary debt bondage. Children worked from the age of three or four, and infant mortality was high. Ramphal was one of the slaves who rebelled. The villagers had begun meeting with organizers from Sankalp, a grassroots NGO that has so far helped 4000 slaves to free themselves from slavery in the stone quarries of Uttar Pradesh. Seeyawati, who works for Sankalp, recently explained that organizers offered the villagers two things initially: “an example of another village where we’d been able to get some progress done,” and the question: “how long could they live this life as a slave?” Bala, who also works for Sankalp, added: “Earlier on there was no hope at all amongst the people. They didn’t believe they could be free. We gave them a new hope, and said to them: ‘What has happened has happened. The past is past. But it’s up to you to make a change, because it’s your life and the lives of your children.’”  The slaves called a mass meeting, and were joined by 3,500 people from 60 villages. Slaveholders interrupted the meeting, attacked the villagers, and shot guns into the air. The villagers retaliated by throwing stones and one of the contractors was killed. His friends set fire to Sonebarsa. Eight men from the village were scapegoated and jailed. Ramphal was one of these eight. After the burning of Sonebarsa, Sankalp assisted the 40 refugee families and helped them form micro-credit unions. The villagers pooled their money, and petitioned for a mining lease. But the Allahabad Mining Corporation wouldn’t allow leases and so the villagers moved onto unoccupied land in Uttar Pradesh and began mining it. Authorities protested this in court, but a judge ruled that no unauthorized workwas being done and signed leases. Today the villagers continue to build their community, which they have named Azad Nagar, “the land which is free.”"
Ravi,2004 (Narrative date),Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My name is Ravi Shanker Kumar. I think I am between 12 and 13 years old. My maternal uncle’s son was working in the loom and it was he, in fact, who told my uncle to go back to village and talk to my parents so they could send me here. Eventually the loom owner landed up in my village and met my parents. He went to my father and told him that he should send me to the loom factory. I was very happy in my village, playing, having a good time. Until the loom owner showed up. My parents came up to me and asked me if I wanted to go. I refused. They agreed. The loom owner refused to take no for an answer, however. He argued that he didn’t agree with my parents. They succumbed to his demands. He paid them a sum of 500 rupees [$10] and then they asked me to leave. Once he had paid the 500, the loom owner and I took off from the village. We boarded a train and throughout the entire train journey he refused to feed me. He just didn’t give me any food. It was only when I got up to Allahabad that he gave me four samosas to eat. After the train journey we went from the station to the loom owner’s house. We went inside and sat down and ate some dinner and went to sleep. The next morning I woke up without any food or any full nourishment, we both went to the place where the looms and the machinery were kept. That was the first time I saw the loom. I was made to sit at a loom and the very first day that I sat there he made a little mark on the loom itself. He gave me clear instructions that up to that mark I had to weave a carpet. If I was unable to do so, I had to work under candlelight to reach that particular mark. Because I was made to work late-night hours, I would never be able to sleep adequately in the night. As a result I was always sleepy when I was on the loom and my work would get spoiled. The whole morning I would be weaving and I would only get some basic food at about 12.30pm. The food wasn’t good. I didn’t like it at all. Everyday I had to force myself to eat it. Once in a while the loom owner would ask me: “Ravi, have you eaten your food?” And I would say: “Yuh, I have.” Basically, he would give us half-cooked rice, and the dal would be not well cooked and full of water—not at all what dal was supposed to taste like. In fact, things were so bad that once in a while, while working on the loom my fingers would get cut and they would get nipped. Each time I got cut on my finger, I would go up to my boss’ wife and say: “look, I’ve got a wound on my finger. Can you give me some medicine, some ointment you can give to me?” The boss’ wife would not put any ointment for my wound. In fact, she would take a little bit of kerosene and put it in my wound and strike a match to it. That would hurt terribly. The wound would not heal, and we were made to go back and resume weaving again. Very often, because the wound was in raw condition, the blood would start oozing out of my finger. But then we could not stop. With the blood running down my finger I was made to weave. Only when it became so bad that I could not possibly weave anymore, would I stop. And the moment I did stop, I was beaten up. There were two ways he would beat me up. With the stick of the loom, he would lift that up and beat me up with that. Or, there was an instrument called a punja with which we would put the threads down and snap it with the loom. It’s a sharp instrument and he would use the wooden portion of that and beat me with that. I didn’t get any money, but I did get a bed. We were confined in one room and made to work for a period of 12 hours. Once in a day we could go and maybe use the bathroom but those bathroom stops were limited in number. In the evening, once I would finish working on the loom, I would go up to him and ask for a little bit of money so I could go to the market and have a good time. He would always refuse. No matter when we went to him, he would just refuse to give us any money. At the maximum he would give us a rupee. Or he would say: “Don’t worry, we will go tomorrow.” He was always lying to us. My father came to visit me once. He asked the loom owner to release me but he refused: “Until such time as the carpet is completed, I can’t let him leave because he’s the only one who knows the pattern.” My father went away. So that was it. That was the only time I spoke to my father. I would think: “There has to be something better.” I would think of running away. But the thought of running away would always be followed with the thought of: “What if I get caught?” If I did get caught I would be beaten up mercilessly. Therefore I never ran away. I was rescued in a raid operation conducted by Dajna Kurooji, a person who works in the Ashram. He came in a raid and picked me up from there and got me to the Ashram. I was very scared during the raid. I thought I was going to get beaten up again and they’re going to throw me away. I was terrified. The loom owner would tell us: “If and when the police come, run away, run away because they are going to be mean to you.” The police official was smart enough to park the vehicle about three kilometers away from the loom and made his way slowly. We were surprised because they crept up on us slowly. The kids were working on the loom. We didn’t have any option to run away. The first day I came to the Ashram, the other kids showed me around the place, where the bathing area was, where bathroom was. They showed me where the cocks and rabbits lived. I was fed a good meal and I went to sleep. It was just beautiful the first time I knew that I was not going to be beaten or tortured. What I like best here are the studies, the playing, the food, the interactions. I love it. I don’t think I’ll like my home anymore. I think when I do go home, I’ll miss this place. Before I sleep, I always make a comparison between this and home. I’ve fallen in love with this place. I don’t want to leave. But then also I do. I want to go back home. I have no clue—this or that? I’m also trying to learn how to be an electrician. I like the electricity idea. I like the fact that the teacher gives us notes and lessons which we have to memorize. He asks me questions in class and when I’m able to answer, it feels good. When I go back home, I’m sure I’ll join a school and continue my education. I dream to teach my brothers, to teach my sisters. I dream to teach my fellow village people. I dream to learn and teach, and do them both together.I would like to tell the children who are working right now on the loom to stop, to do what they want, to stop. If I got a chance to talk to the world, I would relate my life story. I would tell them that I was working on the loom. I would tell them about my rescue. I would talk to them about how I came to this wonderful place and how I was given the opportunity to study, to learn. I would tell them about my life experiences. And I want to simply tell Father Louis: “Six months, six months of my life I’ve spent with you. But you’ve turned it around. You’ve given me a whole new life, a fresh lease.” This Ashram is such a great place. Not only is there the education, but physical training, prayers, growth in all aspects. Now I know for a fact that every child in entitled to study. I know for a fact that no child should be subjected to any torture from anyone. I know for a fact that you should not be made to work for anybody else for food."," There are hundreds of thousands of children trapped in India’s carpet industry. Most of India’s carpets are woven in Uttar Pradesh, where the majority of workers are low-caste Hindu boys. Some are lured into bondage by agents’ promises to their parents that they will receive good wages, and others are kidnapped. The boys are forced to work for no pay, for 10-18 hours a day, seven days a week. They are beaten, tortured, branded, kept half fed and half clad, and are usually made to sleep in the loom shed. Cuts and wounds are frequent. Ravi was trafficked into a carpet loom in Uttar Pradesh. He was liberated by activists from Bal Vikas Ashram (BVA), an organization that liberates and rehabilitates child slaves. Rambho and other boys were found weaving carpets, wearing only underwear, and had been forced to weave rugs for 12-15 hours a day, beginning at 6am. After their liberation, the boys were taken to BVA, in Uttar Pradesh, where they received medical care, counseling, literacy training, and basic rights education. They returned to their villages after six months. BVA continues to liberate children."
Roseline ,2005 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Cameroon (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I grew up in Cameroon. I always wanted to be a designer. I was in school back then and I always liked to make a little skirt, a little blouse and do knitting. Just trying to create something. I was 14 years old when I came to this country. I wanted to help my family. I was so close with my family, especially my sisters. We did so many fun things together. When we get off school we did each others’ homework. When I came here my sisters didn’t want me to go. But I had to do it because I was told that I was coming here to go to school. It was hard leaving them. If I could wish for anything, I would wish to be with my sisters. I’ve talked to them once in a while but since I came here I’ve never seen them. Unfortunately when I get here it didn’t happen the way it was supposed to. Things changed a little bit…well a lot. I never went to school when I was living with them and I wasn’t getting paid. She told me that she would send money back home to my parents but I’ve never talked to my parents so I don’t know if they sent any money. If you don’t know somebody, don’t send your kids out to them. Don’t just hear that your kid is going to go to school, because they will make that promise but it will never fulfilled. They won’t do it. I would get up in the morning around 5am or 5.30am and at 6am make breakfast and get the kids up and have them ready for school. And once they went to school I would stay home and clean and cook and do their laundry. When she wasn’t home I tried to finish my work so I could relax a little bit. But when she was there I had to make sure that I’m doing something so I wouldn’t get yelled at or hit. Even if I had to sweep the floor three times, I just had to do something. It was actually pretty hard, cause I had nobody to talk to. I used to take care of two kids and sometimes the sister’s kids as well. That’s all I used to do. I had been in the States for a week when I started getting abused—hitting, yelling, cursing. One day I got up around 8am and she hit me and yelled at me that I can’t get up that late; I was supposed to be up before the kids get up and they were already up at 6am. I lived with them for two and a half years and the abuse continued until the day I decided to run away. I couldn’t go for a whole week without getting hit. I really didn’t know what to do. I was just hoping that one day it would stop. I did everything that she wanted me to do. I tried to make sure that everything was right so I wouldn’t get yelled at or beaten up but everything I was doing wasn’t right so I still got beaten by her or her sister. She would use her hand or anything that she had. One day I was cleaning using Windex and she got upset with somebody outside and started yelling at me. She pulled the Windex away from me and sprayed it on my face. I had real long hair and she said she would cut it off. Her and her sister held me and tied me down and put scissors on my hair. One time her and her sister were beating me up at the same time and I tried to open the door so that I could run out. She dragged me back and started hitting me. When I came my bed was in the kitchen. It was actually a couch. And when I was in the kitchen sleeping, the husband, who always liked to go to bed really late at night, 2am or 3am sometimes, started approaching me, trying to sleep with me. I was fighting, and he would say: “I’m just trying to make you feel like a woman. I’m not going to get you pregnant.” It didn’t just stop there, he continuously did that until it got to the point where I started going to bed in double clothing. Whether it was hot or cold I had to put on jeans and sweatshirts and pants in case I fell asleep and he came without me hearing. It was a couple of months before I was sent to the kids’ room to sleep. They had a bunk bed so I slept on one of those together with the kids. One time, one of her friends had a little boy who I babysat, and she gave money to Louisa to give to me but I never got it. At Christmas her friend bought me a Christmas present and a birthday present, because I have my birthday on Christmas day. It was a make-up up set and I kept it in the closet and used it just once. I don’t know what I did to her one day, but she just got really upset and sent her kids to the closet to pull out those things her friend bought. She messed them up in front of my face, and made her kids step on them. When they finished I just picked it all up and put it together. Then I called her friend and let her know what had just happened. She said that it was okay and that she couldn’t do much about it because she didn’t want to get involved. I never went to the doctor when I was with them. One time I was really really sick. I had a terrible back pain and couldn’t even walk. I couldn’t breathe properly. I was sweeping the living room and I just fell down and started crying. I couldn’t stand up any more. I said: “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” and they had to rush me to the Holy Cross Emergency Room. They did an x-ray. I never knew what actually happened to me, they didn’t give me the results. I was just taking pills. The same illness came back again while I was at her sister’s place where Christina used to live. We were all together with the kids because sometimes they went there for weekends. I was crying, rolling on the ground, and she said I was a “witch,” and she was going to send me back to my parents so I wouldn’t die in her house. Christina had a cloth and I put it in hot water and put pressure on. So that day they didn’t take me to the hospital. I didn’t have phone contact with my parents but I wrote letters to them. There was a point when she was hitting me and said my Dad had written to her to let her know that any time I did something wrong, she could hit me. She said he gave her the right to hit me any time. I wrote a letter about this to my parents, asking if is was true, and they replied that it was a lie. When I was still living with her my Mom had a stroke. She said she was going to buy a wheelchair and send it to my Mom, but she was lying. She never did. I know. I think I was a slave. Because if I sit back sometimes and think about it and have a flashback, it was terrible. There were several nights and days and nights that I would sit all by myself and think about things I could do with my sisters. How we used to play together. I would cry cause I missed them, hoping that one day I would get to see them again. Everything, my dreams, just crushed down and I wasn’t going to get it. I wasn’t going to reach it. I never thought of running away until when we moved down to Post Gate Terrace. That’s when running away started coming into my head. But I never knew how to do it because I knew nobody. I didn’t know where to go. She told me that America is not a place to walk around on your own. Whatever opportunity we had, Christina and I got together and talked about running. But we didn’t know where to go and how to do it. One day I had taken their daughter to school earlier in the morning, and the little boy had to go in the middle of the day, around 11.45am. When I went to drop him off at the bus stop I met a friend who used to live in the next building and we talked. Then I went back to the house and changed clothes. I knew I was going to be doing house chores so I put on a short skirt and a little t-shirt. I went inside and grabbed the trash and I was heading to the trash can, and I met the guy I was talking to at the bus stop. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was cleaning his car. While I was talking to him, she was driving right behind me. When she saw me she started shaking her head. She parked and started cursing at me. She called me a prostitute, a whore, said all I wanted to do was to have sex, that I’m planning to have sex with that guy, that before I become pregnant she was going to pack my things and send me back to my parents. She called me all the nasty names you can think of. I just walked inside the apartment and she fell on me, still calling me names and cursing me. I kept on doing what I was doing, and she kept on yelling. For some reason I wasn’t thinking anymore—it was like my blood pressure was rising, my head was pumping inside. I had no shoes on, no jacket. I didn’t think of anything, I just opened the door and ran out. I had a blackout and fell down and hit my head on somebody else’s door. I can remember somebody asking me if I was okay. I told them I was fine, and he asked: “Do you need help? Do you want me to help you?” I said I was fine, that I didn’t need help, and he went back inside and locked his door. I laid there for a couple of minutes and I didn’t know where I was going. I ran upstairs to the building’s hallway and sat in the window, looking down and thinking about what to do next. I kept telling myself: “That’s it. That’s it. I’m not going back in there. I’m not going back. That’s it. I have nowhere to go but one thing’s for sure, I’m not going back.” I sat up there from noon to 3pm. When the kids got back from school, she realized that they had walked home by themselves. That’s when she came out looking for me. I remembered one of her friends, and I ran up the hill to her house. Her back door was open so I went right through. I was crying and I told her: “I don’t want to go back there. Please don’t take me back to her. I don’t want to go back to her place.” She said it was okay, and that I should stop crying. She asked me what happened. I didn’t tell her. I just cried. Louisa came and told me to go back home. I ran out of the front door and she followed me. So I went upstairs in her friend’s building and hid on the fourth floor. I locked the door and prayed that she wouldn’t come in there. I don’t know what I would have done if she had. She came upstairs. I could hear her climbing the stairs, looking for me. She didn’t find me, and went back down. I left and when she saw me run out, she started chasing me. We were running around the building and the neighborhood until I lost her somewhere round the front. I told myself: “I guess this is it. I guess I have to go.” But I didn’t know where I was going. Her friend saw me and she called to me: “We should go inside and talk about this. We shouldn’t get the cops involved.” So I went into her place. She sent me to get her a pen and then she picked up the phone, called Louisa, and told her that I was there. When I heard that I dropped the pen and went straight out the front door. I went up to the town houses where we used to live before we moved, and I was just crying and walking around. I saw this lady and I stopped her to beg for shoes, cause I had I didn’t have any on and it was really cold. She asked what size shoes I wore, and I said seven and a half. She wore size nine, but I said: “It doesn’t really matter. Whatever you have I will take.” She said: “Stay right here, I’m going to get you some shoes.” But I followed her and she went home and down to her basement. I sat down on the stairs waiting for her and she got a pair of flip flops and gave them to me. I thanked her and ran out. I saw a cop coming and I acted like everything was okay, like I’m a totally normal person, because I was afraid. I didn’t want him to take me back to where I just left. Of course I knew that she had called the cops and they were looking for me. I also didn’t want to talk to the cop because of what she had told me in the house—that America’s no good. She told me that the cops are not friendly. When he had driven by I ran down to the big K-Mart, and walked around there doing nothing. Around 5pm I saw a cop in front of K-Mart asking questions and I ran to the ladies’ room and sat there waiting for him to leave. I remembered that her husband’s friend had given me his number a long time ago. He said if I had any problems I could always call him and he’d be willing to help me. I had his number in my head but I didn’t have any change to call, so I begged 35 cents. I made a phone call to his work, and they told me that he had gone out of town but would back that same day. I called again around 8.30pm and they passed me to him. I was really afraid, and was crying and begging him: “Please come and get me, I’ve run away from home.” He laughed, thinking that I was joking, but I was crying, and he said: “Oh my God, are you serious?” He said he couldn’t leave work right now, but that if I could wait for him he would pick me up at 11.30pm. K-Mart closed and everybody had to leave. I had no jacket, just flip flops and a little short skirt. This was in November. I stood outside and I told myself: “I really give up. I don’t care what happens with my life. I’ve tried my best, running away, and now I won’t do it again.” I sat down somewhere dark and put my hands inside the t-shirt because I was really cold. A man came and told me: “You can’t sit there. You could get raped. Go and stand in front of the light where somebody can see you.” I said: “I’m really sorry, I’m fine right here. I don’t really care right now.” He left. At that point I wasn’t thinking about being alive at all. I didn’t care what happened to me. I had fought enough and I had given up. All I was thinking was that I was really sorry for my parents to lose a daughter. Then a woman came and talked to me. I said: “I can’t leave this place. I really want to be here.” She said: “Okay if you’re not leaving this place, I’m going to sit with you. Why don’t you come with me and get in my car, and get in my car and stay warm? We’re going to wait for whoever you’re waiting for.” She asked who it was, and I lied to her and said I was waiting for my Daddy. I said I couldn’t sit in her car cause I didn’t know her. I didn’t trust nobody at that point. She said: “Okay, I’m going to get in my car and you’re going to sit here, and I’m going to wait until your Dad comes. And when your Dad comes then I’m going to leave.” So she sat and waited until 11.30pm. The guy came and picked me up and I thanked her. She drove away and the guy took me to his place. He turned on the heat to keep me warm. They started making some phone calls to see who could help me out, because he couldn’t keep me. I was living with Louis’s cousin then. I didn’t want anybody to know where I was. I didn’t want to get involved with anybody. I just wanted to stay somewhere with nobody disturbing me. When it was Thanksgiving time and they were taking pictures, all I was doing was hiding, trying to stay away from the cameras and the videos, in case somebody looked at those pictures and said: “Oh, I know that that girl, she used to live here.” I was trying to hide away and I was dragging Louis’s attention. That’s how he started asking questions about me. I really appreciate what Louis did for us. It took a lot of guts and a lot of courage for somebody like him to do what he did. People are afraid to do such a thing because that’s how we Africans are—trying so much to not have our names out there. He really took a risk. Hopefully somebody out there will do the same thing that he did for somebody else. Louisa and Kevin had a trial and they pleaded guilty and got nine years in jail. Whatever punishment they gave them actually won’t do me any good. It’s not taking away what they did to me. What they did to me, that’s part of me. It’s going to stay in me so why don’t they stay in jail for 30 years? It really doesn’t take away my pain. I don’t look at it like, “Oh my God, they’re in jail, I’m okay now.” No, I’m still not okay. The clock can’t turn back, it can’t change, it can’t rewind. Whatever damage it did to me is something that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Even if I say something to them it won’t change what they did to me. Even if they have to say sorry, it still won’t heal the pain that they did to me. I will take it to my grave with me. I can’t forget even if I get married tomorrow and have my own kids. I can never forget, cause that’s actually the whole part of me, that’s my whole life. I didn’t get to spend my teenage life like other teenage kids did so mine was a total waste. I can’t sleep, it’s really scary. I couldn’t sleep even when I ran away. I had a room on my own yet it was very difficult. I couldn’t trust nobody. I could go to bed but I won’t be comfortable, even though they tell me a hundred times, “you’re safe here, nobody will touch you here, nobody will do anything to you here.” It’s going to take a very long time for me to trust anybody. To be comfortable on my own, it took me a long time. I haven’t seen my Mom and Dad ever since I came to the States, and both of them passed away in 2002. My Dad passed away on February 9 and my Mom on Thanksgiving day. They didn’t really know the things that happened to me, because I never got that chance to tell them. I’m scared because back home we don’t have lawyers like they have here. You can take somebody’s life away and get away with it. Over here you can get away with it for a couple of months, but not forever. They will get you regardless. I’m actually really afraid for my sisters. I don’t want anything to happen to them while I’m here and they’re over there, because I’m going to be alone without seeing them again. I don’t think I would want to live a life like that with no family. I want to get my education finished and hopefully one day with God’s help I will get to see my sisters again. I hope to get married and have my own kids. I want to be a registered nurse and right now I’m working as a geriatric nursing assistant. I think it’s good after all that everything happened. It actually made me strong so I can face anything that comes to me—anything. No matter how big or how small it is, I think I can handle it. I don’t think anything can make me fear anymore."," In 1999, Roseline Odine reached the turning-point where she could be a slave no longer: “That’s it. That’s it,” she said. Roseline’s narrative features a long escape sequence as she moved through the turning-point from slavery to freedom. Roseline spent two and a half years as a domestic slave in Washington DC. Promised an American education and a babysitting jobs, she was tricked into leaving her family in Cameroon at the age of 14. Upon arrival in the US she worked long hours for no money, was not sent to school, and was beaten and verbally abused. Roseline was also sexually harassed. She recounts a process of indoctrination and mind-control that eventually meant she “didn’t want to talk to the cop because of what she [her enslaver] had told me in the house—that America’s no good.”"
Sabitha-Jayanthi,2002 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sri Lanka (trafficked from),Sri Lanka (slavery location),"I was born in a village in the North. My father was transferred to another province we settled down in a village there. This area I lived was a beautiful place. When I was small I remember many tourists coming into this seaside resort. There were big hotels. People were prosperous. We were many in the family. My mother never went for a job; she was a housewife. We had good water facilities, tap as well as a well. We had a large garden with many fruit trees, like lime, orange, mango, pomegranate, coconut, etc. We did not rear chickens. We owned cows, but we give it to other people to rear them. When I was small I used to play a lot with my friends in the neighborhood. My father used to spend time with me. I liked him very much. We had a library in our village — I used to go there and I like reading books… Till I was 13 years old I had a very happy childhood at home with my family. I left home to join the movement. I like my race, language and my people — so I joined the movement to fight for the freedom of my people. When I was about 12 years old I began to feel for all those people who were displaced and were coming from all over the areas. This and other incidents that people spoke about made me feel sad. Some schools were broken; we had no school and no freedom. I saw some people who were brought to the hospital; they were cut and maimed by the enemy. I knew some children who had lost both their parents and their life became so difficult overnight. Four days before school closed for vacation, nine of us school children planned to leave together and we did it. Everything around us was breaking; we felt there is nothing for us. This group was strong and helpful. They were trying to do something for the people. As soon as we joined we were taken by boat and sent away for training. Many of us went and started training. The place we were trained I cannot remember now. Then things were different; many groups at that time were together. I had no connection with the family. They knew I was alive somewhere but they did not know where I was. I was given a wooden gun, a dummy, as I joined and we cannot lose that, if you lose you are punished. That was like life though it was only a dummy. We were given six months basic training. I cut my hair short. We get up at 4 a.m. Then we follow a timetable. From 5:00 in the morning we have different types of training, at about 8:00 we have breakfast and then again up to 10:00 we have exercises like basic physical training and other special exercises. We get something to drink and go in for further work like climbing jumping or swimming. During the training I run 5000 meters. I was trained in swimming and weight lifting. We had to carry the dead bodies back — so weight lifting helps you with that. How to bury mines, how to make a map of camps and so on. After being in one group for several years, I was sent for direct fighting in the field for several years. When I got the uniform for the first time, I was happy and thrilled to wear a uniform. One day when we walked near a small town, there was a scrub jungle where we decided to rest. At that time the people were with us and were helpful. Still, somebody had given the tipoff. We were very tired and slept in the jungle. For five hours we rested. It was then that the army surrounded us. They took some of my companions and shot and killed them on the spot. I was taken captive so suddenly, for a moment I was not alert as I was sleeping and we were caught all of a sudden. I did not have the presence of mind to end my life. So I had to go through all the torture that they could ever give a human being. I told them who I was and I stuck to only the truth, why I joined and so on. Throughout their questioning I said the same thing the way I told you. I was treated very badly. No human should suffer like me. I always told them the same story. I was hung upside down and I was hit. My face was covered with a cellophane bag. My heels were hit and got swollen. My nails I don’t want to tell you, they peeled off. The sole of my foot was hit. I was made to swallow 100 small limes that hurt my tummy and for a long time I suffered of the aftereffects. After I was beaten up brutally I smelt of blood. The worst that will never ever go off my memory, in a way nothing could be cleared from my memory. The sexual harassment, I was a virgin, I have never had sexual relationship. That day the torturers used soda bottles and pierced me. I fainted. When I regained, I was in a pool of blood. I was treated worse than an animal. In the torture room, I was naked. I was made to bathe naked. Every fellow there was watching me. I was dumped in a sack, taken as dead. I was left out side to be burned with a tire. For some time I must have been there. It rained and I slowly regained consciousness. The man who came to burn me found I was alive and I was taken out and carried back and then I was given another lease of life. Someone in a higher rank was a bit kind and that was the only one that helped me. One day a big fat man took me in for interrogation, he locked the door and loosened his trousers and came on me. I screamed loud and other officers banged on the door. He had to stop and I escaped. Then my family got me out and sent me away. I felt very bad and hurt. After all the suffering I had gone through, I was still not free in this land. That is the fate of not only myself but also everyone here. First of all I have to get out of this place. I am working here and I am paid some money and work keeps me occupied. All treat me like the elder sister. I have to think of helping my mother. I have lived enough for myself — now I want to live for her. I don’t want to get into any more difficulties. I have to improve myself. My problems are there all the while, I have to fight against my feelings that come rushing. I have to take a good decision. I have to do something. My mother now lives in a rented house. So I want to build a house, for that I have to earn a living. After coming here I studied. I can now understand things. I have bad dreams often as though somebody is torturing me — I shout out. I am scared to be alone with men. Even now I don’t like a man getting close to me or trying to touch me. I will never ever marry a man, they will never ever understand what torture is and how miserable a human being, a girl can be. There is no one who will understand me. I don’t know what my future will be. Now at nights I wake up and I do something very strange. I scratch the wall. You must see the wall beside the bed. There is one girl here, she is also up in the night. When she hears, she calls out and asks me what I am up to. I count the holes in the mosquito net. I don’t know why I do this. I shouldn’t have been caught alive, I should have been alert. I wouldn’t be here. I always feel angry against the military, but I can’t afford to take revenge. I don’t want to. I still feel we should feel free and independent. I can’t run to another country, even if I run away, I have to come back here. My problem in facing the world is beginning only now. The man I have decided to marry might leave me, I have some doubts — will he accept me the way I am? I cannot trust anybody. I’m confused all the time. When others discuss about the future I run away. I will need help when I leave. Maybe some work with elders or orphans, this will be good for me — as a lonely person, I can be useful to some others. My mind I feel is frozen. My mind is broken. I’m still scared of my life. I have sinned, my father trusted me and I have sinned against him. He died because of me. All my lost self-esteem cannot be regained.","Sabitha-Jayanthi became a child soldier in Sri Lanka at the age of 13. In Sri Lanka, children as young as nine have been abducted and used in combat by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The LTTE used children as soldiers throughout its conflict with the Sri Lankan government, between 1983 and 2002. Children—most aged 14 or 15 and over 40 percent girls—were used for massed frontal attacks in major battles, and some between the ages of 12 and 14 were used to massacre women and children in rural villages. Others were used as human mine detectors, assassins and suicide bombers. A ceasefire was implemented in February 2002, but this didn’t halt the LTTE’s use of child soldiers. In fact, children were more likely to be forcibly recruited: people saw no reason to give their children to the LTTE if they did not perceive themselves at risk by the government, and so the LTTE resorted to abduction. In 1994, one in 19 child recruits was abducted. By 2004, only one in 19 was a volunteer."
Sumara,2004 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"I want to talk about my life as a bonded laborer, as a slave. It was very tough living under the control and exploitation of the slave owners. During those days, my husband was in prison. I tried to go to Bara to file a report. The police refused to file one. I didn’t know what to do. My eyes were red from weeping uncontrollably day in and day out. I went every single day for four days and asked them to file a report, to hear my account of the story. Nobody was there, nobody paid any heed. I then went to Allahabad, sat on a car all the way. It was only then that somebody heard my side of the story. I was asked to come and produce myself as a witness. I did. I cried repeatedly: “What to do, where to go, whom to meet?” Everything was such a mess. Things began to become a little better, however, when Sankalp came into my life. Because of them, there were regular meetings conducted. But even that was something that slave owners could not tolerate. They refused to let us hold meetings in the village itself. We all started meeting at a place called Ramgarh, a huge open ground. Sankalp told us: “You’re under the obligation and the exploitation of the slave owners.” They said that life could be better; that if we heard them out, and listened to what they had to say, we would be able to live free from any form of exploitation—have basic freedom to do what we wanted to do. They told us we could all collect together, fight against the exploitation of the slave owners and then live our own life. Later they promised our children education, so that they would not be laborers, but initially the first step was to get us together so we could think of how to get out of clutches of the slave owners. We were barred entry into our own village. After four whole days we were finally allowed inside and we saw there was nothing left of the houses, there was not one single piece of clothing to wear, no food to eat, no utensils, nothing. We were left to fend for ourselves, without any means of livelihood. Sankalp came in to help us. They would organize food from other villages and give us food to eat. It was during this time that we acquired a lease.We’re happy now here. We have a lease, we work, we get our money, we earn our own livelihood, we have food to eat. Now I can dream about a future, and live a happy life. I feel a little lazy—it’s so easy. Our kids go to school. For my son my dream is that he does well, he learns, he studies, he reaches high up, and he’s not like me—he doesn’t break stones. That’s my dream. I’m very happy. You all sing, you dance. There’s joy in our life now."," In 2000, some of the 220 residents of Sonebarsa, a quarrying village in Uttar Pradesh, India, revolted against their slaveholders. About 40 families lived in Sonebarsa, all of them Kols, an ethnic group near the bottom of India’s steep ladder of caste and discrimination, and all locked into hereditary debt bondage. Children worked from the age of three or four, and infant mortality was high. Sumara was one of the slaves who rebelled. The villagers had begun meeting with organizers from Sankalp, a grassroots NGO that has helped thousands of slaves to free themselves from slavery in the stone quarries of Uttar Pradesh. The slaves called a mass meeting, and were joined by 3,500 people from 60 villages. Slaveholders interrupted the meeting, attacked the villagers, and shot guns into the air. The villagers retaliated by throwing stones and one of the contractors was killed. His friends set fire to Sonebarsa. Sankalp assisted the 40 refugee families and helped them form micro-credit unions. The villagers pooled their money, and petitioned for a mining lease. But the Allahabad Mining Corporation wouldn’t allow leases and so the villagers moved onto unoccupied land in Uttar Pradesh and began mining it. Authorities protested this in court, but a judge ruled that no unauthorized workwas being done and signed leases. Today the villagers continue to build their community, which they have named Azad Nagar, “the land which is free.”"
Selek’ha,2006 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"I am Selek’ha. I am about 26 years old. I was taken from my mother when I was two years old by my first master, Mohamed Salem. Salem was my master and my mother’s master, and he inherited us from his father. They belong to the Ehel Hobatt family from the Hyayna clan of the Awlad Gheilan tribe. They live in Tawaz, in the department of Atar, the region of the Adrar, and they are connected to the Ehel Saka family who are in Tidjika, in the region of Tagant. I was a slave with these people, like my mother and my cousins. We suffered a lot. When I was very small I looked after the goats, and from the age of about seven I looked after the master’s children, and did the household chores—cooking, collecting water and washing clothes. Salem wouldn’t let me sleep until the children slept. If I did, he would put tobacco in my eyes or sometimes he would whip me. When I was ten years old I was given to a Marabout, who in turn gave me to his daughter as a marriage gift, to be her slave. I was never paid, but I had to do everything, and if I did not do things right I was beaten and insulted. My mistress did nothing. My life was like this until I was about 20 years old. They kept watch over me and never let me go far from home. But I felt my situation was wrong. I saw how others lived. One day, I was making the tea, and I walked—I walked away, and kept walking until I reached the town and found some help. My elder brother had been freed by Salem sometime ago; he came to see me and told me that I would go to hell for leaving my master. My brother is an ally of my master; because he was freed, and freedom is the greatest gift your master can give you.Sometime after escaping, I went to SOS Esclaves to ask them for help in freeing my mother Oumoulkhér Mint Mahmoud, who is 50 years old, and my brothers and sisters: Khaïrat Mint Mahmouda (27 years) and Oume Elbarka Mint Mahmouda (20 years), who were with the Ehel Hobatt family in Tawaz, Bilal Ould Mahmouda (16 years), El Kheir Ould Mahmouda (13 years), Abdel Barka Ould Mahmouda (10 years) and El Maimoun Ould Mahmouda (seven years). My cousins are with the Ehel Saka family at Tagant and still in slavery."," Selek’ha Mint Ahmed Lebeid was born into slavery in Mauritania. She escaped in 2000 at the age of 20 after she reached a turning-point and realized she was a slave: “I felt my situation was wrong. I saw how others lived.” One day she started walking and didn’t stop until she was free. Then, with the human rights organization SOS Slaves, Selek’ha returned to seek the release of her mother, Oumoulkhér. "
Salma (Narrative 1),2003 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"My name is Salma. I want you to read this attentively. If you want to meet me, I am here. I am a witness, before the whole world, to the fact of slavery in Mauritania. I was born a slave. I was born in Mauritania in 1956. My mother and father were slaves for one family, and their parents were slaves of the same family. Ever since I was old enough to walk, I was forced to work for this family all day, every day. We never had days off. We hardly knew that it was Saturday or Sunday, because we had to work every day. Even if we were sick, we had to work. When I was still a child, I started taking over my mother’s job, taking care of the first wife of the head of the family, and her 15 children. Every day at 5am I had to make their breakfast. First, I had to get water, and wood to make a fire. We were in the desert, and the well was far away, so often I had to walk a long way. I had to cook all their meals, and clean their clothes, and watch all the children. Even if one of my children was hurt or in danger, I didn’t dare help my child, because I had to watch the children of the master’s wife first. If I didn’t, they would beat me. I was beaten very often, with a wooden stick or leather belt. One day they were beating my mother and I couldn’t stand it, I tried to stop them. The head of the family got very angry with me, and he tied my hands, and branded me with a burning iron, and he hit me across the face. The ring on his finger left a scar on my face. When I was a slave, I was never allowed to go to school or learn anything more than some Koran verses and prayers. But I was lucky, because the eldest son of the master had gone to school away from our village and had different ideas than his father. This eldest son decided to help me. He saw that I was smart, and he secretly taught me to speak French, and to read and write a little. I think that everyone thought he was raping me, but he was teaching me. The first time I tried to escape was about ten years ago. When I left the family’s village, I didn’t know where to go, and I went in the wrong direction. I didn’t know how close I was to Senegal, just on the other side of the river. So instead of going to Senegal, I walked for two days in the wrong direction. I found another family with slaves, and I hid with the slaves, but that family found me and sent me back. The head of the family punished me terribly. They bound my wrists and ankles and tied me to a date tree in the middle of the family compound, and left me there for a week. He cut my wrists with a razor, so that I bled terribly. I still have scars on my arms. Finally I managed to escape. I met a man in the market who told me that Senegal was not far away, that it was just across the river, and that I could escape. So I decided that I had to try. I ran away from the family compound and went to the river. At the river, a man with a small wooden boat agreed to take me into Senegal. There I made my way to a safe house run by a former slave from Mauritania. I stayed in Senegal for a few years. But I never felt safe there. I knew that Mauritania wasn’t far away. Always, I had in my head that the master of the family could come and pay people to look for me and bring me back to his house. I was afraid all the time in Dakar. I was free. I still wasn’t free. The man whom I met in Rosso told me that I had to go to the United States to be truly free. I saw this man again in Senegal, and he told me that I had to go to the US. I spent several years in Dakar. I worked to live. I cleaned the house, and I washed clothes. When I got to New York, to the US, I found liberty. I worked when I got here, braiding hair. That was the first time I had been paid for work I had done. To be paid for my work, that was really liberty. To work for someone and be paid, I can’t even explain it. I had never believed in that. Even here, in New York, I believed that I would be treated like I was in Mauritania. The first time I was paid here, I cried that day. That really helped me. I didn’t know that. I had never seen a person paid for her work before in my life. It was a very, very good surprise. Now I am used to that. It has really made me happy. To work, and to learn things, to go to school, to learn, to talk with people I choose to talk to: these things are liberty to me. To have the liberty to discuss with people, to be free to go where I want, to eat what I want, to sleep where I want. Before, I didn’t have that. Really, seriously, before, I didn’t have that. Also, to have my children with me. One of the hardest things for me was leaving my children behind in Mauritania, but I knew that I had to escape first and then figure out how to get them out of there. In the three years I have been here, I have been working to secure the liberty of my children, so that they would be as free as me. I had to pay people in Senegal so that they would find them and bring them to Senegal. Now most of my children are in Senegal. Every morning I get up early, and buy a phone card, and I speak with my children. All my children tell me that they would rather die in the street than to return to Mauritania. Also I have been paying for them to go to school in Senegal. They never want to school in Mauritania, there they got nothing. For them, they love to go to school, to learn. One of my children is now in the United States with me. My children were like dreams for me. Since I have had my first daughter here in the US it has become reality. I want very, very much that the others will join us. That is also liberty for me. In Mauritania, I never had the right to make decisions concerning my own children. Here, it is incomparably different. I myself went to school in the US. I have been learning English. I want to continue learning English. I want to learn many things. I want to learn to speak English well, like everyone. I want my children to learn English better than me. I want to become an interpreter somewhere. I also want to learn how to use computers. These are things that would never ever have been possible for me in Mauritania. In Mauritania, I didn’t dare go to the government, because they wouldn’t listen. Because for them, slavery is normal. It doesn’t matter what the laws say there, because there they don’t apply the laws. Maybe it’s written that there is no slavery, but it’s not true. Even in front of the President of Mauritania I can say in full voice that there is slavery in Mauritania, because now I’m as free as he is. When I arrived in the United States, I was in Harlem, with Africans, who took me for a while. Then I went to the Bronx. The Africans with whom I was living explained to me that I should apply for asylum, that I should go to Immigration. I made an application with the help of some Africans. Then I went to Immigration for my interview. Immigration sent me to Federal Plaza, to Court. I went to Immigration Court, and the judge asked me if I had a lawyer. I told him that I had a lawyer, but he didn’t come. The judge told me I should get my money back, and that I should go to a different lawyer, who was honest. I saw the name “New York Association for New Americans,” and I liked that name, and I went there. In the beginning, in the US, I was afraid of going to Immigration. I was so afraid that I would be sent back to Mauritania. After I met my lawyer, I learned that that wasn’t true. Here, if you are honest and correct and you tell the truth, you will really have your liberty. Here, it’s freedom. The judge was honest, and he did his job. The judge demanded proof, but then he paid attention and listened. I met a doctor who helped me, and Professor Kevin Bales, and the Bellevue Program for Torture Survivors. It was a big difference from Mauritania, and a big surprise to me. A big difference. The hard things in life now are not understanding English, and finding work. To live here, you really have to work. Those are my difficulties. In Dakar, I was in a house, and I didn’t pay, I just did a little work. Here, people don’t help you that way. You have to pay for everything. At NYANA people helped me. At a certain time, they gave me money to pay my rent. I would like to be a citizen of the United States one day. I want my children to be citizens. I came here and got total liberty. I see that here there is democracy, which to me means freedom of expression. In Mauritania, there was no liberty of expression. In Dakar, I was afraid to speak out, because we were so close to Mauritania. I had to be cautious. I had to be far, far, far from Mauritania. Here in America, I can speak out. For me, liberty was a thing that was necessary, that all the slaves must dream of. I always thought about liberty. The other slaves were afraid of being free. They were afraid that they wouldn’t know where to go or what to do or who to talk to. Me, I knew that it wasn’t good to be afraid, and I was never afraid of liberty. I always believed that I had to be free, and I think that helped me to escape.I know many people who are still slaves there, from my family and other families. I never knew people in my family who escaped before me. In my family, I was the first one. My mother and father died slaves. I told my mother that one day I would be free."," Like her mother and grandmother before her, Salma Mint Saloum was born into slavery in Mauritania. Slavery was first abolished in Mauritania in 1905, by colonial French rulers, and again when Mauritania joined the UN in October 1961. It was abolished for the third time in 1981 by the Military Committee of National Salvation. But the situation didn’t fundamentally change: masters don’t have to pay their slaves or provide any sort of social security; the ban did not address how masters were to be compensated or how slaves were to gain property; and there was no provision for enforcement. This arrangement allows the legal fiction of slavery’s abolition to continue. In 2003 Mauritania passed a law that made slaveholding punishable by fines and imprisonment but no slaveholder has been prosecuted. As Salma explains in her narrative, “[i]t doesn’t matter what the laws say there, because there they don’t apply the laws.” In 1997 Salma decided not to wait any longer, and liberated herself. She crossed the river border into Senegal, but still didn’t feel free. As she notes, “I was free. I still wasn’t free.” She felt that to be “truly free,” beyond the danger of re-enslavement, meant going to the US, and so began a journey that retraced the route of the transatlantic middle passage, though with a very different outcome. In the US, Salma observes, she experienced “total liberty.” Her narrative includes a long section that compares her life as a slave with her life as a free person, and Salma defines this new freedom. She focuses on freedom of expression, and being able “to talk with people I choose to talk to…to be free to go where I want, to eat what I want, to sleep where I want.” Freedom also means being able to “make decisions concerning my own children,” for in Mauritania she “never had the right” had to “watch the children of the master’s wife” instead of her own. Most importantly, however, freedom means being paid for her work. This, she emphasizes, is “really liberty.”Salma first told her story, as printed here, in 2003, and updated it in 2009."
Shanti,2001 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"My name is Shanti. I do not know my age. I have five children. My contractor has said, “if you die I will take your dead body out of the mud and make you work to return my debt.” My husband died in September or October this year and the contractor gave me no money for his burial. The head contractor came the day before yesterday. I have a nine-year-old daughter and the contractor caught her hands, and said that he would force her to work to repay my loans. He says I owe 8000 rupees [$180]. My husband took the loan, and now that he has died the contractor is forcing me and my daughter to pay it back. I tried my best to work somewhere else but if he does not let me go, what am I to do? He forces me to work for him. I break stones. The problem is that those big stones need to be brought out of the mountains. Some stronger person needs to do that job, my husband was doing it but now that there is no one to bring those stones. So whatever small pieces are lying there I break those. I break enough to earn 400 rupees [$9] and it takes me ten or 12 days to achieve that. I don’t even have a place to stay. I stay on someone else’s land. And when they tell me I have to move my little hut, I have to move it.Narrative as told to Peggy Callahan for Free the Slaves, November 10, 2001, in Son Barsa, Uttar Pradesh, India."," Shanti narrated her story while enslaved as a bonded laborer in the rock quarries of Uttar Pradesh, India. Debt bondage is the most common form of modern slavery. Found predominantly in South Asia and South America, it occurs when a person pledges their labor or that of a child for an indefinite period of time in return for financial credit. Debts arise in India from two main sources: an urgent crisis such as illness, injury, or famine, and the need to pay for death rites or marriage celebrations. Technically, bonded laborers can end their servitude once the debt is repaid, but this rarely occurs. A combination of low wages and high interest rates makes it impossible to repay the initial debt, and the debt usually increases because the employer deducts payment for equipment and living expenses, or charges fines for faulty work. According to India’s laws, families can simply walk away from debt and bondage, but this is usually impossible: if families try to leave, the slaveholder’s thugs retaliate with beatings, rape and forced eviction. If a family survives the beatings, they are free to starve. Without access to jobs, health care, community support or credit, independence is impossible to sustain, and they re-enter debt bondage.Though the Bonded Labor Abolition Act of 1976 criminalizes the use of the system, which is 1500 years old in India, those in debt bondage face involuntary servitude in brick kilns, rice mills, carpet looms and embroidery factories. Bonded labor is also widespread in the quarrying of granite and other stones. Workers are required to purchase their own materials, and are forced to borrow money from the contractors or quarry owners. Children aged four to 14 are required to work along with their parents for up to 14 hours a day, carrying loads of rocks in order to maximize production. Bonded children are sometimes sold to other contractors, and female workers are frequently raped. Accidents caused by explosions or drilling are common, and workers suffer from respiratory illnesses due to inhaling stone dust.  "
Shyamkali,2004 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour Debt bondage,India (trafficked from) Debt bondage,India (slavery location),"My name is Shyamkali. There’s a whole story from the beginning to the end about what happened to me. I took one loan. My son needed medicine, the roof was falling down, I needed some money. I was illiterate, so the documentation was something I could not read. He probably made it for his own purposes, and because of that loan I became a bonded laborer. Every time I went back to the money lender, the amount of the loan had always increased. The last I heard, my family owed him 10,000 rupees [$200]. My husband would work very hard and so would I. I had to run my household and try to save some money for a bleak day. That’s how I would lead my life. It was extremely hard and there was no freedom at any point. We were made to do two forms of labor. We had to work in the fields and we had to break stones. For all this hard work, we were barely paid, sometimes 300 rupees [$6], sometimes 400 rupees [$9]. The people of Sankalp came and told us that unity is our strength: “If you only unite together, there is nobody who can do anything against you.” They told us that the individual by himself is going to be weak, he’s not going to be able to defend himself against the slave owner, but if we all form an organization, get together and form a group, a self-help group, then we’ll be able to defeat the slave owners. Today is very different. There’s a huge, huge difference. Earlier on we were slaves, either agricultural slaves working in the fields, or slaves working in the stone quarries. But now we are free. We work if we want to, and not if we don’t want to. And this freedom makes a big difference. I now want my children to study. I want my girl child to study. I want her to be able to read, to write, to do a job somewhere as well as to manage a house. I want her to be able to do both of these things together. When I ask the children what happened in school they tell me about the day. Recently, she could count from one to ten, and all by herself she came up to me and wrote out the numbers on her slate. I don’t know how to write. I never went to school, so never in my life did I have a chance. My children teach me but they lose patience very fast. They come and write some kind of message and I can only write half, and then it’s enough and we walk away. Before, when I was a slave, I had no dreams and no ambitions. Later on, when we started forming a committee, there was hope. The hope was shattered when they burned the houses and everyone was refugees. There was again this sadness creeping in. But the unity that we had kept going. I believe in unity. It has become a lifestyle. The next step for all of us is to ensure that the cooperation and coordination, the unity, remain strong. We want to get a government hospital built somewhere close by. We also want to improve the conditions of our school and make it more safe. Women have a huge role to play. We feel very important because we are also bread earners. Since we earn, we also have equal role to play in fighting for our freedom. Freedom means economic independence as much as it means freedom of movement."," In 2000, some of the 220 residents of Sonebarsa, a quarrying village in Uttar Pradesh, India, revolted against their slaveholders.

Tamada,2005 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Niger (trafficked from),Niger (slavery location),"My name is Tamada, I don’t know my age but I think I am about 20 years old. The situation of a slave is more than I can say. With all the violence, I lived everyday in fear. I was born into slavery, like my mother and grandmother. I was separated from my mother when I was very little. My master took me with him from Niger to Mali and gave me to his eldest son. I worked everyday since I can first remember. I was always moving; pounding millet, washing, cooking. I worked from dawn till late after dark, collecting firewood and fetching water. I was also made to clear up my master’s faeces. When I was small I looked after the camels and if they wandered off I would be beaten. As I got older I began to look after my mistress’s children and then I had to do all the household chores. I only saw my mother sometimes. When my master’s father came with his family, then they would join our encampment. My master and mistress often insulted and spat at me. I was scared because if I didn’t do what they said they would hit me. There was so much violence, verbal insults, spitting. My master used to beat me often. I was so afraid of him. I heard from other slaves that my mother and grandmother had escaped, and then things got bad for me, as my mistress wouldn’t let me out of her sight. But I started thinking about running away. It was hard, I cried a lot, I kept thinking of my mother. I didn’t know where to go and kept thinking of the danger. I have two small children and I was very scared. One evening a few months later I grabbed my children and when no one was looking I ran. I carried my children and walked and walked, very far, over 30 kilometres. I walked from encampment to encampment begging for food and shelter, and when I got near Inatés on the border with Niger some people told me about Timidria. I remember being so scared; I thought my master would come after me. Thanks be to God some good people took me to the Timidria people. They helped me so much, they helped me find my mother. I can not find the words to say how life is better, now I live in Ayorou with my mother and grandmother. I am happy now I have my own family, and I no longer live in fear, but life is hard, we have very little, sometimes not even enough to eat."," Tamada was born into slavery in Niger, home to some 43,000 hereditary slaves. Found among four of the country’s eight ethnic groups, slavery is a centuries-old practice in Niger. Slaves are controlled through violence and indoctrination, and are separated from their parents at a young age. Women and girls perform domestic duties, men tend herds of cattle and goats, and children are often passed from one owner to another. Individuals are also born into slavery in Mauritania, Mali, and Chad. Slavery was outlawed in Niger in 1960, when the country claimed independence from France, but this remained a theoretical ban. In May 2003 slavery was made punishable by up to 30 years in prison, and that same year, Tamada learnt that her mother and grandmother had escaped from their master. She decided to do the same. But her turning-point took several months: she waited, worried, and thought about running away, before seizing her children one evening and beginning her escape. Leaving Mali, she crossed the border back into Niger with her two children—the first born when Tamada was 12 years old. She was assisted by Timidria, a human rights organization founded in 1991."
Vasanthi,2002 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sri Lanka (trafficked from),Sri Lanka (slavery location),"I am from a very large family. My family is very poor. Our problem is poverty and our life was an eternal struggle. We lived in a small house. We had only two rooms for all of us. We had chickens at home — this brought some income. All of us worked hard, but we had not enough money for our needs. We tried to get daily paid work, which was hard to come by as there was always the war going on. All the time what I was hearing was that the people and the army were giving trouble. From the time I was about 10 years old I was thinking and thinking and planning that I should also do something for my people. One day I left home at about 7 p.m. and walked alone for two miles. In the area where I lived you can go out alone any time and no one will hurt you. So I walked and walked without any fear to a base. I was angry with as they had done lot of damage to my people and I don’t think they will ever like us. I had a furious feeling within me against them terrible angry fire within me. You know they have not only just killed our people — they have put them into tar barrels, burnt with tires. Our children were put into boiled water. People in the border villages were cut up. After a while I was taken into the real base in the jungle and I was placed in the ladies group where I was to get used to everything for about two weeks. Within three months of my joining I was put onto basic training. I was small but I got jeans and shirt to wear. The uniform was of green stripes. Food was not that easy to get — but somehow or other we managed. We always drank boiled water. You don’t even sleep on a Sunday. I was trained for all types of attacks. Group attacks, single attack, finding out missions and various ways of escaping. Till the day I was caught I was fighting; have been in attacks where we were victorious. When I launched into a fight I have to defend myself and not get caught. Will the army catch me? Will they take me and abuse me? These were always in my mind. We are all classed as traitors by both sides. As soon as you are caught the movement will think you will betray them and the army will not trust because you have also killed them. This I feel is a terrible situation. I don’t think people in this country will ever feel good towards us. You know what has happened to our brothers? We too could be killed and what can you do? Maybe there is something called retribution. The way I feel about my family and my people they will also feel about theirs. We lost that trust forever. Sometimes I feel terrible, have let my side down? I still have a sad painful feeling in my mind, after all the efforts I could not see my people get their freedom. Now I am a prisoner. I don’t make close friends with anyone. I don’t trust anyone; I keep everything to myself. I am a lonely person throughout my life. Who am I now? I have an identity card, which does not mean anything. I am confused and sometimes I worry whether I will be able to live as a free person where I was born and struggled to live. I am not afraid of death now. Nothing is going right. I don’t know what is happening. God has become a stone. He does not listen to our prayers. Nothing happens the way we want to. I’ll live for my family. I am not worried about myself. I have family and I want to help all of them in whatever way I can. I’ll now sacrifice myself for them. I want to go abroad. I have no future here. Everyone in the village will know who is who. And who did what. Eternally I have to be running away from everybody. How long do I run? I don’t know. I did not study because of our poverty. Nobody should be born poor. If you are poor— you are like a corpse. I must earn a living. I am waiting anxiously for my mother to come. She said that she would sell our house and bring me money. Anyway she will have to find money for me to go abroad. That’s all I have, nothing else to tell you.","Vasanthi became a child soldier in Sri Lanka at the age of 10. She was one of hundreds of thousands of children who participate in armies and armed groups in more than 30 countries around the world. The problem is most critical in Africa, where up to 100,000 children are estimated to be involved in armed conflict. Child soldiers also exist in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, even though international law sets 18 as the minimum age for all participation in hostilities."
William,2006 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"My family means a lot to me, means everything. You need to have a hug from your mom, a kiss, hang out with your father, laugh. I was six years old when I was captured. People came and boom boom, running by with horses and shooting people, killing people, capturing kids, taking kids away, and tying them to horses. When I saw a person shot, bleeding, it scared me more than anything. You’re a little kid, you’re thinking Grandmother will come along and yell at them and get you out, but no. You’re gone for good. Because I was a little boy I had to accept it, because I don’t have my family around me, to survive I had to accept it. You have to lie: “I look at your wife like my mom, I look at you like my father.” In the capital I was so excited, not thinking about the past—you’re a poor man, trying to survive. Then I thought, you go to Egypt, you make good money, and buy what you want. I still need to get a hug from my mom but it’s not going to be the same. Right now I am not free. My heart’s not free. When we talk about slavery and don’t take action, it feels like, “why should I say my words?” I should just stay at home and forget about it. But I can’t forget about it. I can’t. When I was captured I was six years old. I saw four three-year-olds getting killed because they didn’t have mothers. Who was going to be the mother of those kids? So they just took them and killed them. And when they kill them, they don’t kill them in a way you can’t see—they put them in front of you, and say, “you see that?” They want to get you to be scared. So when you’re six years old and you don’t have a family around you, when you have no one to protect you, what do you think? In my situation, I built a lot of trust with my master—got him to trust me to be a leader in front of other kids. But I didn’t tell the other kids my plan. You just have to do it. I planned it for five years. I saw people getting cut in the feet when they tried to escape. They cut their toes, and when they cut your toes you cannot run. You can’t even walk far. They want you to watch their cattle in a field every day. You sleep outside like animals—rain, cold, no shoes. You’re not a human being. You have to forget about your life. You’re not thinking about your family anymore. You have to think about yourself. So the kids in Sudan have a mentality that they don’t even want to leave anymore, because they don’t believe in their family—they don’t know where their family is. They don’t care anymore. Some people blame their families. And what about the mothers, whose children are captured? Even if their child makes an escape and comes back, what is she going to do? He’s going to have no culture, he’s going to be a weird person in the family. He’s going to see himself alone, always. He’s not going to be happy. Sudan is not a country that has education. Do I know my story? Some people don’t even know their birthday. Some people don’t know what money is. When I was in my village, I thought I was in the only village in the world. But if kids have education, they will not be enslaved today. They will now what a ‘human right’ is. Today, ‘human rights’ is about talking. It’s not about action anymore. When you think that the United Nations is speaking up today—a UN resolution, section this, number that, quote 1500 whatever—what does that mean? Will it help me in the village? I don’t have TV in the village. I have my resources, people are killing me for my resources, but I don’t know what the resource is because I’m not educated. I don’t know where the oil is, I’m not educated. I’m getting wiped out, in my land. But when we have education, paper keeps the story. When you write something down, you pass it down to generations. We don’t have that. Do we know if our great grandfather was a leader? Do we know if he was a thief? We don’t know, because we’re not educated. Politicians in South Sudan, their kids are in London, America, first world countries. What about the poor kid? The person who doesn’t know how to use soap, to wash his clothes, to wash his hands? What are we going to do for him? Are we going to help them, or just let them die like a dog? I don’t count myself as disabled. I have a brain, I don’t have hands. It doesn’t bother me. What bothers me is when I see people hungry. And I’m here eating, I have a TV, I’m sleeping. For 22 years I haven’t seen my mom or my dad. My grandmother, who I was visiting when I got captured, died in 2004. Do you think she died happy? I didn’t find my family until 2004. I didn’t meet my brother until 2005. My brother told me people believed I died and was buried a long time ago. Nobody believed. People have to take action, but we just do research. I don’t have anything to do with my people anymore, but I won’t give up. I’m here in America. I was in Egypt and my hands got lost, and I didn’t know where to go, but I made it to America. I’m here today, talking to people. Because when you don’t talk about your problem, I tell you that’s your problem. You have to speak to people, to let them know. We don’t need Sudan to be a perfect country. But the kids who are slaves today, are we going to get them out? I’m not going to give up. I believe. I escaped and I’m here today."," In 1985 William Akoi Mawwin was captured and forced into slavery at the age of six years. During raids by Muslim militia from Northern Sudan on the villages of the Christian Dinka tribes during the 1980s, tens of thousands of other boys between the ages of four and ten had the same fate. As well, babies and toddlers were killed, and girls were raped, killed, or forced into slavery. Some boys who escaped capture headed to refugee camps in Kenya, but it is estimated that only one in three survived the journey.After seven years in slavery, William escaped and lived on the streets of the capital. He worked to earn money for a passport, and left for Cairo, Egypt, where he found work in a rubber factory before a machinery accident took his hands. In 2001 the US government granted 3600 Sudanese orphans refugee status. Some 500 boys, including 21-year-old William, were placed in Arizona.William fashions his capture as a sudden disappearance: “You’re gone for good.” But his narrative confronts this problem of erasure and offers a solution: “I’m here,” he insists. This assertion of ongoing presence is part of William’s call to action. While his family gave him up as dead after he disappeared—“[n]obody believed,” he observes—William refuses to give up, in turn, on other slave children: “I’m not going to give up. I believe,” he concludes. For while he still doesn’t feel entirely liberated (explaining that his “heart’s not free”), William seeks a final sense of freedom through activism that might lead to a large-scale liberation of Sudan’s slaves. Reminding his reader about “the kids who are slaves today,” he asks: “What are we going to do…?”"
Jennifer,2005 (Narrative date),Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"In the labor camp, we were forced to do all kinds of heavy labor work, including planting grass and trees, clearing garbage, digging cellars for storing vegetables in winter, knitting sweaters, knitting cushions, making toys, producing disposable syringes, wrapping sanitized chopsticks and so on. Most of the products were for export. In particular, the sweaters we knitted were large sizes only suitable for foreigners who are big in build. In February 2001, we received an order for 100,000 toy rabbits…The rabbits were about 30 cm long, brown in color, with a long neck, wearing a large bright red collar made from fleecy material, with two black whiskers on each side of the face, about five-six cm long. Some of the rabbits wore cowboy vests, some wore dustcoats, and some had one eye patched up like a pirate. There were English letters on their chests, with their fists clenched, thumbs up. There were three toes on their feet, canary yellow in color. Their tails were white in color and very short. Usually the toy rabbits for processing were delivered to the labor camp by a middle-aged woman riding a tricycle. The steps we did included: flip over the rabbit which had already been stitched from inside, stuff the man-made cotton wool into the back, neck, ears, the 5-petal small flower on the head, and collar. Thread a soft steel wire into the ears, stitch together the back and collar, sew on the whiskers, use thread to stitch the mouth so as to make the gaping mouth close a little bit. Sew the eyes to make it more firm, glue on the eyebrows, use thread to shape the fingers and toes on the hands and feet. (The hands and feet of the half-made product are in one piece; we used threads to pull back parts of the hand and foot tightly, so the dent looks like a finger groove). Stitch on the tail, stick alphabets on the chests, etc. The tools used to stick the eyebrows and the alphabets on the chests look like a hot air gun. Except for the processes of sticking the eyebrows and the alphabets and stitching on the tails, I did all the other steps. The ears, five-petal small flower and collar were separate from the body when they came to us. We stuffed man-made cotton wool into them. After filling the ears, we flipped them over and threaded a soft steel wire (or aluminum wire) into them. The rabbit’s collar is a circular loop, the diameter is about four-five cm. After stuffing in man-made cotton wool, it is directly sewn onto the rabbit from the outside with red thread. This is the first time I learnt this method of sewing in the labor camp. The thread is pulled after sewing and the two sides will appear very even. You cannot see any traces of the stitching. This method is also used to sew the rabbit’s body from the back (if you can get hold of a rabbit and carefully pull it open, you can also see if a certain section of its collar and the section slightly above its back is sewn together using this method). Before sewing it up, it is first stuffed with man-made cotton wool. There is a wire in the body of the rabbit (slightly thicker than that in its ears, the wire seems to be two-ply, all the way through to the back of its head). The whiskers are made using black nylon strings one mm thick. This kind of nylon string is about 50 cm long before being cut up for making the whiskers. It is threaded through a needle which is stuck into one side of the rabbit’s cheeks through underneath its nose and out from the other cheek, leaving a five-six cm long nylon string at the beginning spot where the needle was pricked into, thus forming the rabbit’s whiskers. Then the nylon string is knotted so that it does not move and it is threaded back to the other cheek and cut off. The string is cut off so that it is around one cm shorter than the one above. After making the whiskers on one side, the two whiskers on the other cheek are completed using the same method. When the nylon string in the needle is used up, another is threaded in and the process is continued. It would go through over 30 processing lines to make a rabbit like this, and it would take over ten hours to make one. But the processing fee for each rabbit was only 30 cents. The processing fees were paid to the labor camp. We didn’t get anything. Usually we began work after getting up at five o’clock in the morning, and worked until two or three o’clock in the morning the next day. Sometimes we had to work overtime, otherwise we could not finish the job. At the busiest time, I did not dare to wash my hands after going to the toilet, in order to save a few minutes. At night, sometimes I was so exhausted that I could not even count clearly from one to nine. Yet I still had to force my eyes open to knit sweaters. The pattern of the sweater was quite complicated; sometimes we finally finished the knitting after much effort only to discover the next morning it had been knitted completely wrongly. So, we had to unpick the stitches and redo it. Long hours of highly intensive workload and severe lack of sleep made me feel, for a very long period of time, that the only thing I needed in my life was sleep."," Hundreds of thousands of people are trafficked across international borders each year, but millions more are enslaved within their own countries. Unknown numbers have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps). Created by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong, the Laogoi system is intended to “reeducate criminals” and uses prisoners as a source of cheap labor. The camps produce major consumer goods and pay no salaries. Prisoners work for up to 16 hours a day and experience solitary confinement, torture, gang rape, sleep deprivation, malnutrition, drugging, and brainwashing. Some of the Laogai prisoners are practitioners of Falon Gong, a spiritual movement based on Buddhist principles that was banned in China in 1999. Jennifer Zeng was one of these individuals. She was held in Beijing Xin’an Female Labor Camp and forced to make toys."
Seba,1996 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Mali (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"I was raised by my grandmother in Mali, and when I was still a little girl a woman my family knew came and asked her if she could take me to Paris to care for her children. She told my grandmother that she would put me in school and that I would learn French. But when I came to Paris I was not sent to school, I had to work every day in their house. I did all the work; I cleaned the house, cooked the meals, cared for the children, and washed and fed the baby. Every day I started work before 7am and finished about 11pm. I never had a day off. My mistress did nothing. She slept late and then watched television or went out. One day I told her that I wanted to go to school. She replied that she had not brought me to France to go to school but to take care of her children. I was so tired and run down. I had problems with my teeth. Sometimes my cheek would swell and the pain would be terrible. Sometimes I had stomach aches, but I still had to work. Sometimes when I was in pain I would cry, but my mistress would shout at me. I slept on the floor in one of the children’s bedrooms; my food was their leftovers. I was not allowed to take food from the refrigerator like the children. If I took food she would beat me. She often beat me. She would slap me all the time. She beat me with the broom, with kitchen tools, or whipped me with electric cable. Sometimes I would bleed; I still have marks on my body. Once in 1992 I was late going to get the children from school, my mistress and her husband were furious with me and beat and then threw me out on the street. I had nowhere to go, I didn’t understand anything, and I wandered on the streets. After some time her husband found me and took me back to their house. Then they beat me again with a wire attached to a broomstick until I lost consciousness. Sometime later one of the children came and untied me. I lay on the floor where they had left me for several days. The pain was terrible but no one treated my wounds. When I was able to stand I had to start work again, but after this I was always locked in the apartment. They continued to beat me."," The vast majority of domestic slaves are girls aged between 12 and 17. Globally, domestic work is rarely scrutinized or legislated, and statistics are hard to obtain. But the International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that at least ten million children, some as young as eight, are trapped in domestic labor around the world. There are two million child domestics in South Africa, 700,000 in Indonesia, 559,000 in Brazil, 200,000 in Kenya, millions more in India and Pakistan. The trafficking into domestic labor of children—mainly girls—is estimated to be worth $7 billion per year. Seba was one of these domestic slaves. She left her home country of Mali for France at the age of eight: a couple took her to Paris, promising her parents that they would educate and care for her, in return for work as a nanny. But Seba was enslaved as a household servant, beaten, tortured, and forced to do domestic chores. She was freed when a neighbor heard the sounds of abuse and beating, and managed to talk to her. Seeing her scars, the neighbor called the police and the French Committee against Modern Slavery (CCEM). Medical examinations confirmed that Seba had been tortured. In her narrative, which she told at the age of 22, Seba focuses on her mistreatment at the hands of a “mistress.” Though she does describe an occasion when the husband joined in a beating, most of the narrative is devoted to the starvation, beatings and torture by the wife. As well, while Seba terms the woman “mistress,” she never refers to the man as “master,” only as “[the mistress’] husband.” Showing a woman wholly invested in the institution of slavery, this narrative challenges the equation of mastery and manhood. The image is a drawing by Seba, which she completed while telling her narrative. It was the first time she had ever tried to draw a person. "
Karla,2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from),Mexico (slavery location),"","Karla Jacinto Romero was trafficked by a 22-year-old man at the age of 12, and enslaved until the age of 16 in brothels, roadside motels and homes in Guadalajara and other cities in Mexico. She estimates that she was raped 43,000 times, by 30 people a day for seven days a week during four years. She gave birth at 15 to a baby. The baby's father, a pimp, used the child to further control Karla, threatening to kill the baby if Karla tried to escape or resist.Karla was rescued during an anti-trafficking operation in Mexico City in 2008. She has shared her antislavery message with the US Congress, the Mexican House of Representatives, and the Vatican. Her testimony was used as evidence in support for H.R. 515 or Megan's Law that mandates U.S. authorities share information pertaining to American child sex offenders when these convicts attempt to travel abroad."
Leah,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"First of all, I want to genuinely thank each and every one of you for the opportunity of letting me share my story in the hopes that something that has gone on for far too long will be recognized and totally eradicated from our society. I was a typical teenager, came from a loving Christian family and had lots of close friends …. But one bad decision would ultimately change my life forever. I became addicted to drugs and the one person I thought was helping me break free of my addiction was in fact a trafficker of young women for the sex trade. It seems strange to even use the term “Modern-day slavery” in our country, but It went from something I knew next to nothing about, to the way I was forced to live my life for seven years. I knew of slavery from what my history classes taught me, it ended. Unfortunately, for many people today, this is just not the case. This is a way of life they are forced to live, how to think, when/where to eat, sleep and work. Slavery is alive and well today. Modern Day slavery, or as my pimp referred to it, “white slavery,” is simply a way for monsters to make a very good living. Throughout the seven years of being trafficked, I - along with other young women – were used as a commodity by one pimp and were bounced around from Myrtle Beach, SC; Miami, FL; Houston, TX, San Diego, CA; New Orleans, LA; Scottsdale, AZ; Chicago, IL; Columbus, OH and Denver, CO - for the sake of making money to enable our pimp to live the lavish lifestyle he wanted to live. We were used to glamorize and entice more young girls to ultimately feel a sense of initial comfort, only to be brainwashed into a dark cult of servitude. We were trained for one thing, to make him money. He was and still is, the most manipulative, calculated person I’ve ever encountered. My heart bleeds for the victims that are still under the control of others, living similar lives. I was fortunate in that I had a loving and caring family and close friends who welcomed me back with open arms, helping me to find my new normal. This was all done with the assistance of A-21. Unfortunately, so many other victims are not so fortunate as I, coming from backgrounds that include abuse and neglect and may fall through the cracks of what limited social services may be available to them. With the absence of a strong support system, these survivors more likely than not, will find themselves back in similar or even worse situations. If you’re not familiar with A-21, let me just tell you about what they are doing worldwide: • They’ve been operating for 8 years, currently working in 10 countries directly with survivors of trafficking across four continents, specifically USA, Thailand, Greece, Bulgaria, Ukraine and South Africa. • They have provided direct assistance to countless victims, some victims being as young as four years old. • They have assisted victims not only in sex trafficking, but in forced labor, forced begging, domestic servitude and organized theft rings. • They have a comprehensive after care to bring the survivor all the way from the point of rescue/escape to independent living. This includes full medical care, trauma rehabilitation programs, education support and social enterprise opportunities. • A-21 also offers legal representation for their survivors and have seen significant sentences on human trafficking across Greece, Ukraine, Bulgaria and South Africa so far. Without A-21, I would not have been able to walk this road to healing. Without the constant support and dedication of A-21 I’m not sure exactly where I would be today. Cara Lee Murphy, who is the US aftercare manager has gone above and beyond to ensure that my past doesn’t define my future. She continues to push me forward and to excel in whatever endeavor I choose. Without her, I could have just been another girl forgotten. Today I want to stress the importance of education on human trafficking – it does exist and not only in third world countries. It is a way of life for criminals in the heartland of America. I owe my recovery to the A-21 campaign, which is not only for abolishing and educating our society on modern day slavery, but for the recovery of victims such as myself throughout the entire process. And when I tell you that it’s a process, IT IS A SLOW, DAY-BY-DAY, PROCESS. Coming from a situation like I was in and getting thrown back into “normal” society, you have to find your new normal. Now that we know the truth about human trafficking, we cannot turn our backs and pretend that this problem does not exist. Therefore, I cannot express to each of you in these few minutes, how important it is that we - concerned citizens, educators, legislators, non-profits, and law enforcement - educate our youth and communities on what human trafficking is, how pimps work and who they profile. It’s a dirty secret in our society, but we can prevent others from falling prey to these predators. This was something I was never taught. This is a cancer, growing stronger each day and it is up to each of us to do our part to stop it. I encourage you to take a serious look at this problem and do everything you can in your power to assist agencies like the A-21 Campaign. Thank you for your time and God bless you.","In February 2016, at a hearing entitled Ending Modern Slavery: Now is the Time, ""Leah"" testified before the Senate Foreign Relates Committee.

Evelyn ,2016 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Cameroon (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Evelyn Chumbow. I am a survivor of human trafficking and an active anti-human trafficking advocate. I also serve on the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, following my nomination by President Obama in 2015, where I advise the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF). I was trafficked from Cameroon to Silver Spring at age 10. My trafficker told my parents that I would receive a better education in the United States. However, instead of attending school, I was forced to cook, clean and care for the children of my captor. Every time I would ask to go to school, my trafficker said I couldn’t go because I was too stupid. I would go days and weeks at a time without eating. Sometimes I would have to stand throughout the whole night. Other times, my trafficker would beat me until she was too tired to continue. She would call me “fat”, “ugly”, and “dirty.” Too dirty that I wasn’t allowed to sleep on a bed and had to sleep on the floor. At seventeen I discovered I had family living in the area and ran away to my aunt’s house. She also abused me and forced me to care for her daughter. Eventually, I ran away again and went to a local church, where the priest helped to put in contact with Catholic Charities. My trafficking was investigated, and criminal charges were brought against my trafficker. I was placed in foster care and became a ward of D.C. Foster care was a different, but also difficult challenge. I was happy to be in foster care, but the situation there was also dangerous. I was placed in a low income neighborhood, , and a lot of the other kids in the system were bad influences: drug dealers, prostitutes, gang members. I really wanted to get the education that was taken from me. I was too old to go to high school, but I went to a public charter school. I was happy for the opportunity to get an education, but hated school so much because the other students were gang members and drug dealers. But I refused to let that environment take over me. I got my Associates degree from the Community College of Baltimore County and just graduated from the University of Maryland University College with a BS in Homeland Security. At age 21, I was no longer considered a ward of the state. I got a house in Maryland, but still faced many struggles. For example, even though I was a green card holder, I still didn’t have the documents necessary for many social services, including food stamps. There is no additional help available after you leave the foster care system. A lot of people are really interested in your story and getting you out of your situation, but after we are rescued, nobody cares what you do. Survivors need more help once they escape their traffickers. We continue to suffer When I left my trafficker, I was talking to trees and still insisted on sleeping on the floor. I have physical scars that I carry with me, scars that I have to explain to my husband and young son. I also have many emotional scars. Survivors need psychological services. If I had the money to go to therapy, I would go. Accessing services is hard. Finding long-term care is hard. Our lives were taken away from us and we need help getting back into everyday life. Some of us are able to do it, but some are not able. It’s important for us to have long term care for the trauma that we’ve gone through. I get calls everyday from girls who have been trafficked and need help. I don’t think that human trafficking should be only sex trafficking but all form of modern day slavery if not for me, but for the next person. As an advocate, I have seen how society and even politicians talk about human trafficking, but it is rare to hear about real solutions, informed by survivors, that can make long-term change. We focus so much attention to sex trafficking that we lose side of labor trafficking, we as foreign children that was brought in to the united state was ask to be brought here, we force into this country and to become slavers. I don’t see the different between sex and labor trafficking, there are people that are in labor trafficking that also being sexually exploited everyday by their trafficking. I want us to focus on ending modern day slavery instead of separating the issue. There is a bill in Congress right now that just passed in the House called HR 4058: Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act that is dealing with the child welfare system – but it doesn’t include children like me, children trafficked for labor. It only includes children trafficked for sex. I will like to recommend long-term assistance for survivors of human trafficking including education and job opportunities. Additionally, foreign survivors should educate law enforcement officials on the cultural dynamics in relation to foreign victims of human trafficking. Language barriers create misunderstanding between foreign victims and law enforcement. Having survivor interpreters may help alleviate misunderstandings. The key to prevention tools for modern day slavery is education. Many victims come from impoverished areas where there is little to no opportunity for advancement. People find themselves in these situations out of need and do not understand the potential implications of their decision to leave and go to another company. They have a skewed reality that a foreign country will offer more opportunity, however many find themselves enslaved. Additionally, those that have even escaped from their situation find themselves re-victimized due to lack of job opportunities. With all that I have gone through, I am now a mother and wife, I just recently fulfilled my long term dream of getting degree, I am also working at one of the biggest law firm in the world and working helping survivors of trafficking to get a job.","Evelyn Chumbow was taken from her family in Cameroon at age 10 by a man who convinced her parents that she would get a better education in the United States. Instead, she was forced to work as a slave in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, doing manual labor for her captor and being verbally and physically abused.In her narrative, which she delivered before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she asked Congress to address labor trafficking as well as sex trafficking, and referenced a House bill that addresses only sex trafficking."
Edward,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",United Kingdom (slavery location),"I needed to earn enough money for my daughter for her school, and I was told about a good job in England, so me and two others took it. We were picked up and driven to a port; we went on a ferry to England. When we arrived they said we were going to work for good money, so we worked very hard, for long hours, to finish the job well. But when we finished, we never got paid. Instead we were locked up. They forced us to do more work. They would beat us and threaten us if we didn’t finish the work. We couldn’t go anywhere because they took our passports, ID and money. We were stuck. I felt hopeless, totally powerless. We would fix up houses, do gardening … I had to move heavy things that I could not even lift. I had to work from the early morning until very, very late 7 days a week. All we were given was some tobacco, alcohol, bread and butter for the week, so that’s how we lived. At this time, I knew I was a slave. I felt very sick, hungry and tired all the time. I was sold, from person to person, bartered for right in front of my face. I heard one man say I wasn’t even worth £300. I felt worthless. Like rubbish on the floor. I wished that I could die, that it could all be behind. I just wanted a painless death. I finally decided I would rather be killed trying to escape than stay. I knew one man who lived a long way away. I had no money or transport so I had to walk as fast as I could or they would catch me. My legs are bad because they beat me but I had to keep going. I walked for 10 days straight with no stopping. I walked about 200 miles, but I was very scared and lost so walked a lot extra. Look! These are the shoes I found, they are the wrong size but they are all I had! When I was walking all I could think about was [the traffickers]. They are chasing me, they will find me. I was very worried. I was very worried. I thought of my daughter too. I had let her down so much. I felt shameful. I was very cold, hungry and alone. I couldn’t find help anywhere. Eventually I reached the city of my friend, but had no way to find him. I knew this was the end for me. I was very happy when I met with Hope for Justice. I knew someone was going to help me! They gave me new clothes, food and a very comfortable bed. They took me to London to get a new passport. Hope for Justice have been very good to me. I didn’t expect any help, I thought I was finished. I am so happy to be free, to be alive!"," ""Edward"" was beaten, degraded and made to work long hours in forced labour in the UK. At one point he was sold by one man to another man for £300. He was removed from a situation of exploitation by the specialist investigators of the charity Hope for Justice. The British Government estimates that there are around 13,000 people in modern day slavery in the UK today. Over 3,000 people, including nearly 1,000 children, were referred to British authorities as potential victims of slavery in 2015, a 40% increase on the previous year. The most common countries of origin were from Albania, Nigeria and Vietnam."
Salma (Narrative 2),2009 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"In Mauritania, every ethnicity has to own another ethnicity and my ethnicity owned some other people also. My owner owned only my family. You might see some other people who live next to you but they had their own owner, a different owner, because they were a different ethnic group racially. We lived on a farm but really it is a desert. My owners herded animals, sheep, cows. If you have that you are rich. They used to own that. I do not remember much about my grandparents. My grandma and grandpa used to work on the farm and in the houses, but I don’t remember much about that because I was very young. They worked on the farm with the animals. When the animals were killed, they took care of the skin of the animals to make it into leather. That’s the most I remember about that. I was around seven when they died. We used to live all in the same house, in the same concession. They were not houses. They were tents, just tents. There were no buildings. It was one concession with everyone together. The house was in a circle with the owner’s house in the middle and all the slave houses around it, but the owner’s house was very protected from the wind. But we used to have a part to ourselves. The family that owned us lived kind of far from that. But it’s the same house. It’s all considered the same house, it’s within the same perimeter. That’s how the slaves and owners used to live. When I was a child I saw my owners all the time. We called them by their name, but they would never call you by your name. We called them by their last name, but they didn’t know your name. Hamad Malami was the last name of that family. They have one type of way to call you. And once they call you that then everyone in that house will know that you are the slave. I can give you an example. Aïssatou. When you pronounce it, it is a very beautiful name. But they won’t call you that. They will call you Aïsa, to minimize your name, or Shita or something like that. They change it to make it smaller. They change it to make it not beautiful to hear. But we know that when you are called by that then someone in that house will know that she’s the one who is supposed to take care of everything. She is the slave. They called me Suidima. My mother’s name was Lorita. They called her Ori. My grandmother’s name was Hamam. They called her Ham. I did not see my parents a lot because they were never there. My parents would take care of the animals but my mother worked in the master’s house also. I remember that my parents were not happy and were always complaining about the owner, but they were never there with me very much. I used to stay at the concession and my parents were at the owner’s concession working and taking care of the owner’s kids. My mom was at their house taking care of their kids. My mom used to be at the owner’s house and she used to do every, every, every single thing in that house with my sisters. They did every single thing and the owners never did anything, just would sit and watch. Even their baths, my mom used to give that to them. She gave them baths, took care of the children, cooked, did dishes, washed the clothes, everything. They needed water for the tub, she would go get the water. It might take her one hour to go and one hour to come back to get the water, maybe farther than that. My mom took care of everybody, everybody, the wife and the children. She bathed the wife and the children but she didn’t bathe the owner. Nobody will touch the man. Nobody washed him. He would wash himself. But the wife and children would be washed by slaves. I used to stay where my mom and dad lived. My parents would never sleep in the owner’s house. They always came back to sleep. They used to come home late at night to their houses. So my mom used to be there with the owner’s children, but they were in a different place. When my parents were working I used to stay home alone because my brothers and sisters were given to other people. I don’t know if the owners sold them or not. All I knew is they weren’t there. My parents, what they did, I didn’t know about that. I just knew that they weren’t there anymore. They were going one by one. When I asked where they were, they told me that they were gone, they were gone, but they will come back, they will come back. I was the youngest one. My brothers and sisters, they were older than me. They started to leave when they were older, when they started to be able to work hard, when they were teenagers. I asked my mom, where did they go? She didn’t even know about it. She told me they are gone, they are gone, but they will come back, they will come back. But it seemed like my mom didn’t know. I never heard my parents talking about it. But they were scared to talk about it. If they talked about it maybe the owner would hear. I was the only one asking where they were. The others wouldn’t talk about it. My brothers and sisters wouldn’t ask. I was asking because I didn’t know what had happened. I was younger and I didn’t understand why we were separated all the time, why they were leaving. I started to work when I was five years old. I used to do the same work my mom did. I would wash the dishes and help my mom. I washed the clothes of the younger children and would go and get wood for my mom. I worked for the owner. Everything I did was for the profit of the owner. Sometimes I would hear my parents talk about the owners. They would say that they hoped that everything would end one day. But they didn’t really want everything to end because they didn’t have somewhere else to go. They wanted everything to end but they didn’t know where to go and they didn’t have other people where they could go. They couldn’t leave if they wanted to, no, no. They couldn’t leave by themselves. Even if they left, the owners would catch them and bring them back. My parents never talked about escaping. They never thought about it. I was the only one who thought about how to escape. I was thirty years old when I started thinking about it. I escaped one day and they brought me back. The slaves know they cannot leave and they believe that they cannot have something else. They believe that whenever they escape, wherever they escape to, the owners will bring them back. So they cannot leave. They will always find them. They never think about going to a different country or going somewhere else. They never think about that. If they do escape they will be punished, yes. I remember one man. He had a different owner. I heard people talking. I heard a man escaped and then his owner caught him and when he came back, they said, he has been beaten to death. People said that they saw the man. The owner of this man was not far from us. He was just across from us. I was twenty- three or twenty-four years old. My parents used to talk about it but not very much. They would talk in secret, very late at night, when my mom came back and the owner was sleeping and when my parents were in the place where they would sleep. My mom used to tell me, if you leave that’s how they will do it. She would warn me. She used to tell me, they will do that to you like they did to him. I knew I wanted to escape. I was tired of everything. I could not understand it at all. I felt like things had started to change inside me and I should not do it anymore. They treated me as a slave. They would hit me even before they would yell at me. They would hit you first to do whatever they wanted you to do. I would wake up at five in the morning and would work until I went to bed at maybe two in the morning. And then I would get up and do it again. I used to think about escaping. I thought that they might catch me but I also thought that I might have success. I used to believe that everything would stop with me, everything will end with me, and I wouldn’t do that anymore. I used to believe that. Even the owner used to tell them, all our problems will come from her. He used to tell everyone to be careful of her because she will be the one who will bring him trouble or give him problems. When I start remembering, I remember that the big master used to say that, from my first memory. He used to tell that to my parents and my parents would tell me. The master used to say to my mom that he would take me from that house and give me to someone else because I could be trouble. When he beat me, I resisted. Maybe he beat me because he knew I was angry. I never accepted it. He could see it in my eyes. When my master would talk bad to my mom, I used to answer in her place. I would answer back, from when I was twelve or thirteen. Sometimes I was afraid, but I couldn’t take it. I don’t know what was in me. Maybe it’s something God put in me. Even where I work now I am always speaking my mind. Whenever I was working or doing something, I was always thinking about escaping. I was always thinking about how to get out of there, always. I would tell my mom that I would leave. She would tell me, if you leave I will be in trouble, so don’t leave. I never talked to my father about leaving, only my mom. My father was the one who believed that we should be there. He said that we don’t have any land, nowhere to go, no place to stay, so we cannot leave there. But he did believe that he was born to do that, born to be made to do that. My mother believed the same thing, but not at the same point. I used to know where West was because that was the way I was praying when I prayed. But I did not know what was the next country next to us or what was on the other side because I never went out. I used to think that I knew there was another country next to us, very close, but did not know how to get there. I used to believe that maybe when I got there, maybe they would take me, but I wasn’t sure about that. I used to believe that I could not escape with someone else because maybe they couldn’t go. I couldn’t go with someone else. On the day I escaped the first time, I was tired. In my mind, I couldn’t take it anymore. I thought I’m doing it, I’m doing it. They day before, they were beating my mom. They beat her because they said the food was salty that day. It was at night, late, late, late at night after I finished what I was doing. I didn’t say anything to my mom. I worked all day and went back to where I would sleep. I stayed up late at night. I wore my clothes but no shoes, nothing. I waited until I didn’t see anyone and from where I was I started running forward. Everyone was asleep and no one knew I was leaving. I ran away to the main entrance of the concession. I ran until I got out of the concession and ran until morning. I ran all night until the morning with no shoes. The ground was very sandy. When I put my feet into the sand it was up to my ankles. I was running and I thought that I had gone far, but I was still within where we lived. I was running until I saw the first house and entered that house, the first house I saw. I ran until I saw the first house and stopped there. I went into that house. There were people inside that house when I got there. They were surprised to see me. I told them my name and said help me. They said, where are you coming from? I said, from my master’s house. They asked me to sit down. They knew my owner. They knew from my last name. They sent someone over there to go get the people from my master’s house. And then they came and took me. I thought I was safe in that house. I thought that I had escaped and that everything was all right, everything was finished, everything was over and everything would end. I stayed there a long, long time before they came. He took an animal with him, what he drove to get there. Then he came and took me. The son of the master came. I first saw him when I was in the middle of that concession, sitting outside. He came and put his animal, got out of the stuff he was driving. He asked me, what are you doing here? I didn’t answer. I didn’t talk. Then he was on the animal and I was walking and we went back to my master’s concession. When we returned, he tied my wrists and ankles and there was someone in charge of beating me. After that, I didn’t talk for a while. They didn’t give me anything to eat. My master told them, don’t give her anything to eat after that. I don’t remember how long it was, maybe four days. I remember that my mom, at night, used to steal things to give me. I was in the place where they tie the slaves, the place where they would put you before they started beating you. It was a steel they would put in the sand, a strong steel that they put inside of the sand, like a steel post. They tied my wrists and ankles around that post and beat me and left me there. My mom used to steal and come there. Not all the time. She would come there and give me couscous into my mouth with her hands. They beat me with a thing they made to beat the slaves. It was wood attached to leather. They cut the leather into strips and attached it to the wood, many strips of leather attached to the wood, maybe 12 inches long. They would hold the wood and whip us with the leather. When I was tied up there I was thinking that if I didn’t die from this I would go back, I would escape again. I knew I would. All the time I was thinking about that, after they beat me, that I would go back. I was thinking that if I didn’t die from that, I would escape again. That was what was in my mind. When they untied me, I showed them that I would never escape again. I was quiet and everything and wouldn’t do it again. I talked to my mom also and told her that I would never do it again. I did everything that they asked me to do and I did it very well. Even if they asked my mom to do something, Iwould go and do it. Everything I was asked to do, I would add more on it, I would do more. I played with the kids and was nice to the kids. The next time I tried to escape was after my mom died. Before that, I thought that I would never leave my mom because they persecuted her after the last time I left. When my mom died, I decided then that I would escape soon. When I first escaped I only had two children. By the last escape, I had seven and my son was very young. He was just born. It was so hard to think about leaving my children. I thought, I am leaving but I will come back and take my children back. But I think that my children were a force for me. It gave me more power to leave, to escape. I really thought when I left that I would come back and get my children. I didn’t feel the same way about my husband. It was not the same thing. My husband came from somewhere and they gave me to him. My parents brought him from another concession to marry me. I didn’t want to be married. I told my mom that but it was done. They arranged it. I was married in 1978. I was twenty-two. I wanted a normal life. I knew that there was liberty somewhere. I saw the master and his family living in this way and this convinced me that I could have freedom. There was someone else inside the house, another slave. That person wanted to help me leave and I would talk about escaping with that person. This was another slave, not in my family. A man. He was short and very strong. His name was Bilal. We first started speaking about it some time after the first time I escaped. Bilal would come to my house and talk to me. He came to me. He told me you should do things slowly, not rush. Things will happen at the right moment, Bilal used to tell me. He said, you need someone to show you the way out of here, you cannot leave like that. We would talk in secret. We would talk at night. I started to form a plan with him. It was a long time that we were planning. We would talk about it when we got the chance to talk about it. But we both knew that this was the plan and when we could talk we would talk. Bilal told me that if you want to leave these people, you have to go across the river. I don’t know how he knew that. He used to tell me to wait until we found someone else to help us. The way he was talking, he meant someone outside the concession, someone who was working on the river, to help me cross the river. When we found him, I left. Bilal found him. I think that someone else knew that person, not Bilal directly. Someone Bilal knew knew him. One night, Bilal came and told me to be ready. He said to be ready, he knew someone who might be able to get me out that night. He said we would pay him. I asked Bilal how to pay him because I didn’t have any kind of money. But Bilal said he would pay him. He was close to the son of the master. Maybe the son gave him money, I don’t know. Bilal had the key to where they stored the food and drink. He was in charge of the food and drink for all the houses. He used to take care of the master’s son and the money. He controlled the food for everyone. I didn’t know if it would be that night exactly, I thought maybe it would be in two or three days. I didn’t leave that night. I left two days after that night. I was scared because of my children. I didn’t know what they would do with my children. All I was thinking was, I will leave, I will leave. The night I left, I called my two oldest children and talked to them, they were fifteen and eighteen, my daughter and my son. They were born in 1979 and the other in 1982. This was 1997. I told them that I am leaving but I am coming back. My son asked if I would come back. My daughter didn’t say anything. I told them that if I didn’t come back that someone else will come back. Then Bilal came late at night when everyone was asleep. He told me earlier that it would be that day. So I wasn’t sleeping, I was waiting. He was making noise with the keys outside and when I heard that I knew it was Bilal. I took all my clothes and my shoes. Then we started walking, walking, walking, like we would walk very far. We didn’t run, we were walking. The first time I ran and this time I walked with Bilal. Bilal talked to someone outside and he knew the way. When we stopped, I started smelling the river. We walked for maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour. It was that close. The first time I went the wrong way. This time I knew that I was going to get away. I knew. And I had Bilal with me. The river smelled like water, water. It was not the same as where I lived. It was a new smell that I never smelled before. I knew it was the river. Bilal told me to stop there and Bilal walked and came back with someone else. Bilal told me, you will go with this person and I will go back. He told me that if you cross the river you are going into another country. You won’t speak the same language but you might see one or two people who speak the same language as you. Bilal knew I was leaving. He helped me. Bilal didn’t want to go. He said that he is a man and he doesn’t have somewhere else to go. He didn’t want to go on that adventure because he didn’t have somewhere else to go. He said that people will help a woman but they won’t help a man like that. He used to tell me that I was smart and that they way I was smart I could make it. The man who took me across the river seemed like he was from Senegal. I never knew his name. He was from another country. He had a boat, a small boat. It seemed like he was a fisherman, he worked to find fish, that kind of person. He was speaking the same language as me, speaking French. Before he left, I told Bilal to take care of my children. I said, do everything you can to help my children to escape. Bilal gave me money. A lot of money. He might have gotten money from the owner, or was selling the food, I don’t know. I don’t know where he got the money. He gave it to me before we separated. Then I went inside the boat and crossed the river. It was a small boat with paddles. The man didn’t speak to me. I was scared but all I was thinking was that I was leaving. After we crossed the river, on the other side there were a lot of people who escaped from Mauritania. That man took me there to those people. It was a forest with tents, where people lived, people who escaped from Mauritania and made their life there. There were a lot of people there and families, families, families who live together. It was like a village. I don’t know if they were all slaves, but all of them were dark. That man took me to those people, that village. He told one of the people there, this person is coming from across the river and she wants to escape and you have to help her. He spoke to a man in the village. I don’t know if he was the head of the village or just another man. He asked me, do you want to stay here or do you want to escape inside Senegal? I said that I didn’t want to stay there. I wanted to go far. I was thinking that I wasn’t far enough away from where I lived. I didn’t feel safe there. I didn’t have any problem with the people but I didn’t feel safe. It wasn’t far enough. When I was there, I was asking people how I could get into the country. The man in the boat had left. I stayed in the village for fifteen to twenty days. After a while I found someone to help me go into the city. That person was from Dakar, from the city, and was making money by getting people out of there. I gave money to that man and he found a car for me to get me to Dakar. Someone else drove the car. That person told the guy who was driving where to take me in that car. They sent me to a street in Dakar where there were a lot of Mauritanian people, a community. When I was in Dakar, I felt that it was over because it was a long, long, long trip. I felt better when I got there. I was there until 1999, for two years, until December 1999. I left the concession in mid-1997. In Dakar, I worked as a maid in someone else’s house. Where I worked, the owner was rich and very powerful and very nice. He was from Senegal. And when I told him my story, he said he would help. I told him, I’m going to Europe. He said no, don’t go to Europe, you can try to go to the United States. He told me that when I get to the United States no one can try to take you back. Maybe if you go to Europe someone can catch you and bring you back, but not from the United States. He went to the port and talked to some ship owner. He talked to them and found me a way to come here. It took him a year, about a year to arrange all of that. The first time I saw the ship I was scared to death. It seemed like it was Greek, from the words on the boat. They weren’t speaking French, it was Greek people. There were men and some women on the ship. I came there at night and they put me somewhere all by myself. I saw them but they were not interacting with me. It was a very small room in the boat. I had foot with me and was drinking and eating, but it was a long, long, long trip. I was throwing up and vomiting a lot. The boat was moving very strong. We were there a lot, a lot of days. I was thinking, would I see my children again? We arrived in Baltimore. They told me it was Baltimore. They put me in a car and told me to go with them. They drove me outside the port and into the city. We didn’t speak the same language but we were trying to speak and it was enough to tell me what to do. The man I used to work for in Senegal told them a place where they should take me. A person then picked me up and took me to NY. I didn’t know the person who took me from Baltimore. I felt like I left somewhere very dark to somewhere very, very light. I was in the dark. Now I started to feel like my life has changed. I met some Gambian people and I lived with them together and I went and started doing hair. And one of them told me that I could apply for asylum when I told him my story. Someone did the application for me. The first time I applied, they denied me. I got hold of the man I used to work for in Dakar. I was sending money to that person and I think that he did everything to get hold of those people at the border, where I first came, that community in the forest. Those people reached Bilal. I was talking to that person and once I sent the money I knew that Bilal would know that it was for my children because I had told Bilal what to do. I trusted him. Bilal did everything, the same way he did for me. I knew he would know what to do. And then I waited. I worked two jobs, three jobs. My first was braiding hair, but also from 2000-2003 I did factory work, and at a store where they sold clothes. I didn’t believe that I could get paid for my work. I saved it and then sent it for my children. If someone doesn’t have freedom, they don’t have nothing. There is no education, nothing. They wouldn’t be a human being without freedom. People should be free, have communication, have something in their mind instead of being worked to death. Freedom is everything. I used to talk about my life at a University in Washington, but it’s not easy. It’s hard emotionally. But I liked it because I’m living and I like to talk about it. If I could, I would tell everybody. Wherever they call me in the world, I would go any time to tell my story.","Salma was born into slavery in Mauritania, one of the last places on earth where hereditary chattel slavery is practiced. She smuggled herself across the Atlantic on a cargo ship to freedom, arriving in the US in 1999. The following year, she sought legal asylum through the New York Association for New Americans.

Nadia,2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation War slavery,Iraq (trafficked from) War slavery,Iraq (slavery location),"Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, Delegates of the Security Council, good afternoon. I would like to thank the United States for calling for this debate and for inviting me to speak. It is with great sadness, gratitude and hope that I stand before you today as one of the few survivors of one of the world’s oldest ethnic and religious groups now threatened by extinction.I am here today to speak on the way the so-called Islamic State trafficked us, transformed the Yazidi women into Sex slaves, and the way IS committed a genocide against my people. I am here to tell what has happened to me and my community that lost hope is headed to the unknown, I am here also to speak on behalf of those who remain in captivity.I am here to speak about a global terrorist organization that came to end our existence, culture and freedom, to speak about the nightmare that change life for a community overnight.Before August 3, 2014, I was living with my family in Kocho village with my single mother and brothers and sisters, our village was beautiful, we were living in peace. But on August 3rd, the militants of the Islamic State attacked our areas and we found ourselves faced with a brutal genocide. These large groups of armed men of various nationalities in uniforms with weapons, had decided that the Yazidis were infidels and had to be eradicated.The Islamic State didn’t come to kill the women and girls, but to use us as spoils of war, as objects to be sold with little or to be gifted for free.Their cruelty was not merely opportunistic. The IS soldiers came with a pre-established policy to commit such crimes. Islamic State had one intention, the destroy the Yazidi identity by force, rape, recruitment of children, and destruction of holy sites they captured, especially against the Yazidi woman where the used rape as a mean of destruction for Yazidi women and girls and ensuring these women will never return to a normal life.On August 15th, the Militants called us to the school building, where the separated men from us; I witnessed from the second floor of the school, they took the men and killed them, including six of my brothers and step brothers who were killed, and three who escaped the mass killing with Creator Blessing.We, the women and the children, were driven away to another area. Along the way, they insulted us, they were forcefully touching women and girls.I was taken with some other 150 girls to Mosul, in a building in Mosul, there were thousands of Yazidi women of children and who previously captured by ISIL to be offered as gifts. A militant approached me, he said they would take me, I was looking down, I was terrified, when I looked up, I saw a big man, he looked like a minister. I cried, I said I won’t want you, I told him you are too big for me, I am a little girl. Another militant walked in, I was still looking down, I saw his feet, he had small feet, I begged him to take me for himself, I was so scared from the big militant.The one who took me asked me to convert, I did not, he then one day asked me for “marriage”, I told him I am sick, most of the captive women there had their menstrual period due to the fears. Then he one day forced me to dress for him and put make up, I did, and in that black night, he did it.He forced me to serve his militant squad, he insulted me by forcing me to dress improperly. And I was unable to bear more rape and torture, I decided to escape, but I failed and I was captured by the guards.That night, he beat me up, forced to undress, and put me in a room with six militants. They continued to commit crimes to my body until I became unconscious.After three months of abduction, finally I was able to escape. Now I live in Germany. Thanks to Germany who accepted to treat me.But it was not only me who suffered, it was a collective suffering, The Islamic State gave us two choices, covert or die, for those who accepted to convert fearing their lives, their men were killed, women were enslaved and children were recruited.To date, 16 mass graves have been found, including a mass grave of 80 women who they didn’t desire, therefore decided to kill. More than 400,000 Yazidis are displaced, more than 40 percent of our areas remain under control of IS, and the liberated areas are not habitable because of the destruction and Yazidi fears to return and live in their homes with peace.Over the past week only, more than 70 Yazidi women and children drowned on their way through dangerous paths to Europe, thousands are seeking and exit, a great percentage see immigration in the only choice.Mrs. President, Ladies and gentlemen: The Islamic State have made the Yazidi women a fuel for human trafficking. I am presenting to you our requests and I have hope that humanity has not died, yet.1. Bring back more than 3400 women and children currently suffering under the mercy of those who lost every bit of mercy.2. Recognize the mass killing, enslavement and human trafficking committed as a genocide, I appeal to you to find a way to open a case before the International Criminal Court.3. Liberate our land, liberate Kocho so that Kocho people can bury the remains of their dead, provide Yazidi Areas and other threaten minorities Areas with international protection so we can return one day and live in peace, I also request that you allocate an international fund to compensate victims and build our areas.4. Open your borders for my community, we are victims of a genocide and we have the right to seek a safe place where our dignity will be preserved. We request that to give Yazidis and other threatened minorities the choice to resettle, especially to the victims of human trafficking, as Germany did.5. Bring an end to ISIL, I have seen them, I have lived the pain they caused. We have to bring all human trafficker criminals and those who committed a genocide to justice so that the women and children in Nigeria, Syria, Somalia, and everywhere in the world can live in peace. These crimes against women and their freedom shall stop now.Narrative as delivered to the UN Security Council at a session on Trafficking of Persons in Situations of Conflict, December 16, 2015, New York City."," Nadia Murad Basee Tah was one of thousands of people who have been enslaved by ISIS in Iraq. She is a member of the ethnic Kurdish minority Yazidi people. In August 2014, 10,000 Yazidis were killed or enslaved during the Sinjar Massacre in northern Iraq. ISIS seized control of Sinjar district, home to about 350,000 Yazidis. After killing the men, they took women and children into captivity. Along with all 1100 women and children from her village of Kocho, Nadia was captured. ISIS also killed six of her brothers, and her mother (who was too old for sexual enslavement). Nadia was taken with 150 other women and girls, ranging from nine to 28 years old, to Mosul. The women and girls were then distributed from centers. This system allows ISIS militants to take and use women and girls, then return us to the center. Like the other women and girls, Nadia was raped and tortured. Nadia escaped to a refugee camp, remained there for a year, then immigrated to Germany through a visa program to treat and host women and girls who have escaped ISIS captivity. In December 2015, the Yazda organization helped her to speak before the UN Security Council. Since then, she had campaigned internationally to raise awareness about the Yazidi genocide and the plight of Yazidi women and girls."
Joy,2006 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Nigeria (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Netherlands (slavery location),"I was born in 1972, in Nigeria. In my family we were six, four brothers and two sisters. I didn’t go to school. I was working with my brother on the farm. I lost my parents when I was very small. When I was about five or six, I lost my mother, then my father at age ten. They were sick. My brothers and sisters were smaller than me: one brother was nine, another six, another four, and the youngest was two. Sometimes my aunt would come, and at harvest time, friends would sometimes come to help us on the farm. Sometimes neighbors would give us work or food. When I was 26, I was taking care of the children, and a man came to me in the village and said he wanted to help me. He said it would help me to take care of the little ones if I would go to Europe. I didn’t know him, I hadn’t seen him before in the village, but he said he knew me. He said he had a lot of work in Europe on a farm, with tomatoes and fruit. He had a wife and children there, and he said that maybe I can assist his wife with the children. I said: “ok, why not.” He said he would be back in three days time to take my picture, to get an international passport for me. Then he came back, took my picture, and said he would be back in a week. When he returned he showed me the passport, and said he had to take me somewhere. We went very far—before, I had only been to the next village or to the market. When we got there I met some men. They had white clothing, and a very big place. There was a woman there too, a priestess. They went outside to talk—I don’t know what they discussed—and then they asked me to pull off my shoes, and they brought blood for me to drink. They asked me to drink it for my own good, and said that it wasn’t going to kill me. I drank it, and they marked my body and my hand. Then they gave me a sheep’s eye and said I had to eat it. I said: “What do you want me to eat this for? I can’t eat it.” They said that anybody who was going to Europe had to do this. I didn’t want to eat it, but I was desperate. They gave me water to swallow it, and when I was finished, they asked me to put my hand on the juju. After we finished, they bought me clothes and shoes. Then they took away in a car, then straight into a ship. In the ship they asked me to hide. They had a cabin and they made me go underneath the bed. One white man took my passport from me and guarded the door. They were all speaking English. All I was thinking was that I found people who were going to help me. We got to Rotterdam, and two boys from Nigeria met us there and asked me to come with them. I followed them, and we arrived at a place. They said I had to stay there and rest. I didn’t see the man anymore. They gave me food to eat, and after three days they said I had to go with them to Amsterdam, to work. They took me there, to the Red Light District and said: “You are one of them, you can also work like them.” I said: “what kind of job is this?” They said: “prostitution.” They said it took a lot of money to bring me to Europe and that this was what I would do to pay back the money. I thought they were joking, but they were very very serious. One man, Johnson, said that if I went to the police, or if the police arrested me, they would deport me to Nigeria, and then he would come to Nigeria by himself to kill me. He said that I have to change my name, and that he was going to give me a new passport, British—not a real passport. He said I have to have it in case the police came. They said to me that because of everything I drank before coming, and because I had put my hand on the juju, if I went to anybody or tried to run away, the juju would kill me. So I was forced to do the work. They said I had to get $60,000. I didn’t see the money—when I saw the customers they had already paid. The money was already collected. They used to give me a drink, and they were putting some drugs in it. Even my food had the drug in it. They didn’t allow me to talk me to anybody, and they had guns. I did talk to some customers, and they said I had to go to the police, but I was afraid. The two boys used to sleep with me a lot, and they used no protection. The first time I was pregnant was in 2000. Johnson asked me to abort. I didn’t know how to do it, but he gave me something to drink. And when I drank it, I miscarried. Then in February 2001, I was pregnant again. He said I had to do what I did before, but I said: “no, I don’t want to do that anymore.” It was very painful. He said that if I didn’t take the drink he would use a knife to cut my stomach. He was very serious. He said if I didn’t want to drink what he gave me before, he would force me to do it. I said: “ok.” I pretended like I’m going to work, and I made up my mind not to drink what he gave me. They dropped me to work, and I knew that they were around the area, watching me. I met a customer and I explained it to him. He said I had to go to the police. But I was afraid at that time—I thought that maybe if I went to the police they will lock me up. I followed the man as if I was following him to a house, and took the metro."," An orphan who was tricked into leaving her village in northern Nigeria in 1998, Joy Ubi-Ubi fashions the turning-point from freedom to slavery as the moment when she drank blood during a voodoo ritual. Afterwards, once Joy was in Europe, her captors said this ritual meant the “juju” would kill her if she tried to escape. As Joy explains, she was thereby “forced to do the work” of a prostitute. She was enslaved for three years in the deprived Bijlmer district of Amsterdam—home to many West African immigrants. But the narrative also includes a parallel turning-point from slavery to freedom: the moment when Joy was asked to drink something again: a liquid that would make her bleed, and miscarry. This time, she refused to take the drink. Not wanting to abort her pregnancy, she made the decision to escape, then was helped by a West African Pentecostal minister who operates mission houses in Amsterdam. This use of native West African voodoo is a common feature of the slave experience for Nigerian women held in Western Europe (of whom there are around 10,000). The women and girls undergo an initiation ritual before leaving their country: for Joy this included the marking of her face and hands, and laying hands on a “juju” (statue), as well as drinking blood. They are often made to swear to the gods that they will work hard for their employers, and will never mention their real names, run away, or contact the police. Captors threaten the women with punishment by the gods for any disobedience, and warn that any attempt to escape will awaken a curse on their families. Once in Europe they are drugged, then resold. Held in brothels, they have sex with customers but are not paid: Joy notes that all money changed hands before the clients reached her room. Any pregnancies are aborted."
Faith,2005 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Zimbabwe (trafficked from),South Africa (slavery location),"I am 26 years old. I was going to school, but I fell pregnant and had to quit. After having my baby, I had no job. Then, my uncle was living in South Africa. On one of his visits home, he informed me that he had friends in Johannesburg who owned companies, and he could get a job for me there if I came with him. I followed him. We traveled with a Kombi driver and four other men. I was the only girl. We left Bulawayo at about 2pm and arrived at Beitbridge at 10pm. Since the other men and I had no travel documents, we were dropped at Beitbridge, while my uncle and the driver crossed the border. At about 12 midnight, we started to cross the border by foot, and swam across the river. At 3am, we reached the other side, and the men placed a white plastic bag on the road so that the Kombi driver would recognize that we had reached there. The driver saw it, drove up, and picked us up. We continued the journey and got to Pietersburg early in the morning. We then drove straight to Hillbrow. My uncle left me at the minibus driver's house because he had not paid the fare. After two days, my uncle came back, paid the driver and took me to a club in Hillbrow and said that is where I would live. He said I had to pay my own rent. Then he had a discussion with the owners of the club and abandoned me there. That night, the runners asked me to go up to my room. Then they sent a white man to sleep with me. That is when I realized that I had been tricked by my uncle. I was very confused. The white man asked me to give him a blowjob. I resisted, so he went down and complained to the owners. They started forcing me to drink alcohol so that I could please the customers. Finally, I had to accept that I had become a prostitute. My uncle came to see me for the first week or two to collect his money, but after that, he disappeared. When I called home, they told me that he had said that I had run away from him and he did not know where I was. I could not tell my family that I had become a prostitute. I just told them that I was working somewhere. I am very unhappy, but now this is my life. I tried to escape once, but I had no place to go to, so I had to go back there."," Faith was taken from her home country of Zimbabwe into South Africa in 2004. Like many young Zimbabwean women, she was trafficked through the false promise of employment. Other Zimbabwean women are tricked into slavery through promises of marriage and education, and some are simply abducted. Zimbabwean women are also forced into prostitution in the UK, the US and South East Asia, and some are trafficked internally from rural to urban areas for forced domestic labor. High levels of poverty and unemployment are factors in Zimbabwe’s trafficking problem, and the low status of women in Zimbabwean society perpetuates gender violence. The situation worsened after 2005, when the Zimbabwean government began Operation Murambatsvina (“Operation Clean-Up”), a campaign to forcibly clear slum areas. This displaced hundreds of thousands of people, and left an estimated 223,000 children vulnerable to trafficking. In South Africa, where Faith was still in slavery as she narrated her story, the number of trafficking victims remains unknown but the International Organization for Migration reports that trafficked women and children arrive from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia (trafficked through Zimbabwe), and that several major criminal groups in South Africa now traffic women: Bulgarian and Thai syndicates, the Russian and the Chinese Mafi, and African criminal organizations, mainly from West Africa."
Flor (Narrative 1),2010 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),""," In 2001, Flor Molina was 28 years old and had just lost her youngest child. She was working two jobs in Puebla, Mexico, but not making enough money to feed and clothe her surviving children. At night, she took sewing classes. When her sewing teacher told her about a job in the United States, she accepted. But a woman confiscated her documents at the border. She was taken to Los Angeles, and immediately put to work in a sewing factory. There she worked 18-hour-days, was subjected to physical abuse, and wasn’t allowed to leave the building unattended. She escaped after 40 days and was helped by CAST, an LA-based NGO. She told her story in 2010, as part of the California legislature's hearings on the California’s Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The law requires companies doing business in California with more than $100 million in annual global profits to report their efforts to eliminate slavery from their supply chains. Flor is now a member of CAST’s Survivors Caucus, a group of women from numerous countries who escaped forced labor in the United States. Another narrative by Flor can be found in the archive."
Shandra,2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Indonesia (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I am an advocate, a survivor of human trafficking, and the founder of Mentari, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing human trafficking survivors with mentorship and job training to help them rebuild their lives. In my native Indonesia, I was a college-educated financial analyst employed by an international bank. I lost my job in 1998 because of political turbulence and its fallout, so I expanded my job search to the United States. After responding to an advertisement for a job in a Chicago hotel, I checked the legal documents, paid a recruiter fee, accepted the position and flew to New York City. I entered the United States lawfully on a nonimmigrant visa arranged through the “recruiting organization” that brought me here. I was picked up at the airport, along with five other women, by men we all believed were affiliated with our recruiter. Shortly thereafter, however, our passports were forcibly removed, our lives were threatened and the situation became clear: we were being trafficked into the sex trade. I managed to escape by jumping out of a small bathroom window, and I cooperated with law enforcement to successfully prosecute my trafficker. It was hard for me to survive because there were not many services available to help me. Safe Horizon, NY assisted me to be independent and also to stay legally in the United States. I believe that to end human trafficking globally, the U.S. government needs to focus on prevention, and on strengthening policies that are enacted to prosecute traffickers and to provide victims with stable and sustainable support. The U.S. government has been a leader, through its annual Trafficking in Persons report and other diplomatic initiatives, in urging governments around the world to do a better job of preventing modern slavery. Our government can do much more. One of the most effective ways to prevent human trafficking is through education and awareness. I urge Congress to invest in supporting and encouraging countries to implement programs that will make people more aware, and will help them question whether a job opportunity is legitimate, or the work of a criminal labor recruiter. Labor recruiters and contractors are directly involved in the trafficking and exploitation of workers around the world, including men, women and children who enter the United States lawfully. These criminal recruiters make false promises about jobs and charge workers high recruitment fees that force workers to stay in abusive or exploitative working conditions under debt bondage. I know several trafficking survivors who paid up to $20,000 in recruitment fees for jobs that didn’t exist. In most cases, they borrowed the money from people or loan sharks in their home country that expect to be paid back. Now exploited, trafficked and unpaid, they cannot pay back those loans – this creates debt bondage. It is important to have uniform standards for employment agencies that send workers to another country. They should be required give information about the working conditions for the jobs they are offering, and they should provide workers with a clear description of the workers’ rights. Congress has an opportunity to help prevent trafficking by illicit labor recruiters into the United States, and to demonstrate to other countries the kind of policies needed to address human trafficking. I urge Congress to re-introduce The Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination (FORTE) Act of 2013, which would deter human trafficking, forced labor and exploitation by: 1. Requiring that workers coming to the United States receive accurate information about the job, their visa, and working conditions;2. Ensuring that no fees for recruitment are charged to workers;3. Requiring that the recruitment agency registers with the Department of Labor; and4. Enforcing a penalty if the law is not followed. I encounter men and women from all over the world who have experienced human trafficking in some form. They are from different nations, cultures and backgrounds, but many have one thing in common: they were brought here by a seemingly reputable recruiting agency. With an estimated 14,000 individuals trafficked into this country each year, it’s a problem that needs to be addressed – this legislation is one important part of the solution. Another important step that the U.S. government can take to prevent modern slavery is to demand transparency in supply chains for products that are sold in the United States. California has passed legislation that requires companies to publicly disclose what efforts, if any, they are taking to ensure their supply chains do not include forced labor. This legislation is a good first step, but it should not be limited to one state; Congress should initiate supply chain transparency on a national level. I also urge Congress to strengthen the United States’ role in developing a shared global foreign policy to fight human trafficking, and especially to prosecute traffickers. Building our capacity to conduct inter-country investigation and prosecutions should be a high priority in that effort. Mr. Chairman, I want to ask today for your support of a Senate companion to H.R. 500, the Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act, introduced by Representatives Honda and Poe. This bill would create a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal government policy and programs on human trafficking. It is so important that survivors play a role in finding the solutions to end modern slavery, and in helping the government understand how to provide survivors the support they need. This proposed legislation is a great step forward. I want to close by saying that as a survivor of human trafficking, I am committed to empowering other survivors. That is why I established Mentari, an organization based in New York that provides mentorship and job training to survivors. It is very difficult for trafficking survivors in the United States, and globally, to recover from such a terrible experience. It is even more challenging when you are in a country where you don’t speak the language and have little or no family support. I hope the U.S. government will recognize the need to provide sustainable support for survivors, including long-term support to help survivors receive training and opportunities to gain employment. Programs that support job training and job creation can help prevent survivors from being re-trafficked, as well as protect all men and women who are vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking. I believe the United States, again, can and should be a leader in demonstrating best practices to the world.","Shandra Woworuntu graduated from college with a major in Finance and Bank Management in her native Indonesia. Looking for an opportunity to work in the US, she responded to an advertisement for a job that promised a six month position in the hotel industry in Chicago. But the agent who met her at New York City’s JFK airport drove her to the brothel and took control of her passport and identification. When she tried to protest, he put a gun to her head. She was forced to work for 24 hours a day at different brothels throughout New York and Connecticut and eventually escaped by jumping out of a bathroom window in Brooklyn. Her traffickers were prosecuted and Shandra now works with anti-human trafficking advocacy groups and is a legislative lobbyist in Washington DC."
Almasi,2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Kenya (trafficked from),Kenya (slavery location),"I know I’m pure, I’m beautiful, someone can see my heart from far. I am a mother of three that is two girls and a boy. In 2009 I was married and when my youngest son was very young and that’s when we separated with their father and he went until today I have never seen him. I don’t know if he’s alive or dead. I went through hardships, I went through hard times with the kids and one was just young so I was going asking for work like washing clothes for people, doing cleaning and I became a very good cleaner and I survived. What I was earning was very little. Before when I was still a girl I had a friend. We used to play and share a lot when we were still girls, I did not have kids at that time and she disappeared for a long time. One day she appeared very beautiful, very different and changed. She came looking for me, I told her I have three children and then told her, “Your life, you have changed. What happened, what are you doing nowadays?” she told me “I’m staying in Mombasa and I go to work and I earn very good money. And you?”I explained to her that I am doing cleaning, that I go wash for people. I told her that now I was worried because my son will be going to class eight and I needed money to pay for education.” She told me no problem. “I will, if you want there is work which is paying very well in Mombasa. And that’s what I am doing and that’s why you see my life is changed. I’m not the one you had seen before.” Because she was a friend, I trusted her and decided to go to Mombasa. I left my children with my mom who I told I had found work in Mombasa. I had hope that maybe I could change something in my home because even my parents have that good life. We then travelled that day, I can’t remember when but it was in 2009 at night. We reached Mtwapa at night. She then took me to a very private house with no neighbors. She called they opened the gate and we went inside. I was told that I would be given an interview because I said I am a good cleaner. While I was cleaning the house I found there were some other girls there. I did a good job, I was accepted. In that house there was no going out and there was no cleaning job again. I was employed there but not as a cleaner, it was another job…Every evening men used to come there and pick up girls. We were there, it’s a big house but I think some were used to do that job by now. I also had no clothes so they brought me clothes, short clothes. I was not drinking alcohol but I had to drink there. You are forced, you must do what they want you to do because the owner of the house would be paid, there is nothing you can do because you don’t know where you are. Even now if I am told to say where I was staying, I can’t tell. One day I asked the other girls, “When I was coming here I was told that I’m coming here to do a cleaner job. I wanted to ask that person.” One girl told me don’t ask anything here, if you ask, you might just disappeared. “ One day a customer came and that customer just picked me. He was a white man but he said he wants to go out with me. For the first time in 6 months, I was allowed to come out from that house with him. When we reached town on the road some commotion happened. Something happened and I always say it was maybe an angel that God sent for me on the road. People were fighting on the road and we stayed there, there was a lot of traffic. He did not close the door so I saw that and looked at him, I opened the door and walked out. He didn’t follow me and I always said that was just an angel that God sent to me to take me out of there. From there I went through hell because I had to look for a way to come out of there and come home. I don’t have a relative in Mombasa and maybe that person might be looking for me. I had to look for a way so I begged in the streets, asking for fifty shillings there until I found transport to come home. I chose a wing because it helps creatures like birds to fly. It gives them energy and I feel that I have a wing to fly too. I put different colors there, there is yellow, there is blue, there is red, blue, red and yellow. And this is white. Yellow, for me it gives me courage to go on with life and blue, this is the color that makes me feel like I have been liberated from jail. Somehow I was being jailed and I am free. Red, for me it shows the pain that sometimes I feel through my body. Sometimes I go through a lot of pain, I just feel pain. I feel sick sometimes. This red shows how sometimes I feel inside me. The pain in my body. White shows the purity of my heart and soul. How to accept and take everything easy and say there and we have to accept it. Yeah, I have to accept it. I see myself as a tortoise. The tortoise means determination because a tortoise is always determined even if he’s going ten miles. A tortoise is always ready to encounter anything that will come in front of him. He is just going maybe even hidden his head but he is ready to encounter anything. I want to work hard to provide a good education for my children so that they can be able to live a better life. I don’t have a land or something they will inherit but I can give them education that will be their future. I am passionate about working in my community to create change so that other people will not have to go through what I went through. I expect a beautiful future and a future that is truthful. A future that everyone will be able to find greener pastures in their own home. A future with no lies, a great future indeed."," Almasi was enslaved within Kenya.

Rani,2010 (Narrative date),Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was living in Southern India and had loving parents. I got to live my childhood. I was happy. As our financial conditions deteriorated, my father's health worsened. A respectful woman from the village approached my father and offered to ease his burden by taking care of one his children. She said she would cloth me, feed me and educate me. I went to live with her family just down the road from our house. I remember my parents visiting me and how happy they were to see that I was well taken care of. And one day when they came to visit me, I was gone!I was sold by the lady to a man and was told that he was my master. I had no idea what was happening. I was only seven years old. I was a slave to my master! They took an innocent life like mine and treated it like garbage. When I tried to speak - they shut me down. When I tried to protest - they beat me brutally. I was starved and put through much cruelty. I literally saw cages where children were held and seasoned for submission. They broke my will and damaged my spirit. No child should pay this price because of slavery. I became lifeless and worthless. Still the people wanted to make a profit. They put me up for international adoption and that is when my life changed. I was soon adopted by a lady in the United States of America. Ironically, my deterioration became my passport to freedom. In 1999, after 21 years, I returned to the country I hated most, India, for a short vacation. Miraculously in a tourist hotel in Southern India, I met my birth mom and that was when I learnt that my parents had no idea where I went and why I had disappeared. It is after that encounter, the missing pieces came together and I got the picture - I was trafficked at the age of seven and sold into slavery. The feeling was horrific and left me numb. That is when I decided that I need to do something to help all those innocent children and people who are trafficked into slavery. We've got to bring hope and inspiration to people who are sold and subjugated into slavery against their will. From my own traumatic past that still haunts me, no child should be deprived of his/her freedom and dignity. Every innocent child who is sold into slavery, every child who is trafficked pays a high price and we cannot allow that. I have today become the voice of these survivors and victims. Some say I am the face of slavery - but I am also the face of hope and rescue. Under the Tronie Foundation, I am developing the survivor-led mentorship programme for women and children. We all need to come together and become their strength. We need to raise a voice together and end slavery. Together we can prevent crimes against children sold into slavery. I ask for partners such as the UN and their audience to join me as I carry my voice around the world with millions of victims and survivors of slavery, as we all work together to carry a global Anti-Trafficking message.","Rani was taken from her family in India and enslaved when she was seven years old. After a year, her enslaver sold her into illegal adoption. She grew up in the United States. In 1992 she married Trong Hong, a survivor of trafficking in Vietnam, where he had been a child soldier. In 2002, Rani's testimony before the Washington State legislature helped to pass the state's first anti-trafficking legislation.

Asia,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Asia Graves, and I am the prevention education coordinator for FAIR Girls and a survivor of domestic minor sex trafficking in America. It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak to you about what human trafficking looks like here domestically, how trafficking interacts with the child welfare system and to make you understand that a girl who is involved in human trafficking is a victim in need of long-term compassionate services. She is not a prostitute or criminal. I would first like to start out by telling you my story of surviving sex trafficking. I believe that I am one of the lucky few because I received the care and support I needed to overcome my past. Then, I would like to share with you the work I do at FAIR Girls to find and empower hundreds of more girl survivors of sex trafficking right here in the nation’s capital. As a survivor of sex trafficking, I no longer consider myself to be a victim. While the average age of entry into sex trafficking in America is only 13 years old, my life as a victim of sex trafficking began at age 16. An age where I should have been going to school dances and slipping notes to my friends during class. Long before my exploitation began, I was already battling things no child should experience. I did not have a positive support system, my family could not care for me, and the teachers and social workers who met me did not see the warning signs. By the time my pimp sold me, I was isolated and scared, which is exactly what most girls feel as they fall victim. At 16, I was living with my mother who was addicted to crack cocaine and herself a victim of years of abuse. I didn’t know what else to do, so I moved in with my father who was an alcoholic. I did not know my life would turn upside down. My dad told me that I had to pay $900 in rent each month or I’d be thrown out. How was I supposed to do that at age 16? I got a job working as many hours as I could, and I even missed school. When I could not pay his rent, my father threw me out. So with no place to go I moved in with a group of girls who were staying in a one-bedroom apartment. They tried to convince me to sell my body for sex to pay their rent. It was January 2004, and one of the biggest snow storms ever in Boston. But, I refused and started to walk in downtown Boston with nowhere to go and nowhere to sleep. As I walked, a guy who looked about my age pulled up in a car and offered to help me. He said I was too pretty to be out in the snow. I had nowhere to go, so I said yes. The thought of him taking care of me and having a place to live was like a dream to me. The first week was like being in a fairytale full of romance, good food, and a place to sleep. But, then things changed. After a week he told me that he was a pimp and I was his property. When I told him I wanted to leave, he beat me for the first time. Then, he called an escort service who took naked pictures of me and put them on their website. Men came to the hotel and had sex with me. He told me he would kill me or let these men kill if I did not have sex. Two weeks later he took me to the track, which is a place where pimps sell girls like me, and made me work all night – rain or snow, even if I was sick. He said that if I didn’t then he would kill my family. He sold me to several other pimps that had sex with me and forced me to have sex with other men. My story is sad, but it’s common. And, girls like me are all around, but people don’t see them so they remain victims. Three years passed. Pimp after pimp, beating after beating, and feeling like I’d never get free. And, feeling like maybe I was not worth this world. I didn’t even feel I was worth a $3 happy meal. After being beaten, hit in the head with an iron, and sexually assaulted with a hairbrush I had enough. And, I was pregnant. I wanted my baby. I wanted to have someone who would love me for me. I tried to run but was held hostage at gunpoint. When I finally escaped I spoke to the first officer that I could find. My traffickers took out their revenge on me. I thought I was safe staying with a friend, but the next morning my traffickers sent four women with steel-toed Timberland boots to assault me. They knew I was pregnant, and they kicked me all over my stomach and left me beaten on the sidewalk. I lost my baby, and I felt like garbage. I could have died, but something inside me said to fight. So, I walked to the nearest police station and a police woman named Sgt. Kelly O’Connell met me at the door. She knew my trafficker. During the interview, I started to miscarry and Sgt. O’Connell rushed me to the emergency room. Honestly, I feel blessed to have found Sgt. O’Connell and to have a group of investigators to believe in me and my story. I did not wake up one morning and say that I wanted to be a prostitute. No girl does. And, there is no such thing as a “child prostitute” because legally children cannot consent to be sold for sex. No girl chooses to be a slave. Yet, girls like me are the face of modern day slavery in America. You might ask how this can be possible. Here is how. 80 to 90% of victims of trafficking have been sexually abused. That is my story, too. I was raped by my mother’s drug dealers from the ages of 6 to 10 years old, which made me vulnerable to trafficking. I went to school and told my teachers as well as a school social worker who just believed that I was making it up. I stopped asking for help. My life as an American victim of modern day slavery could have been prevented. Over the past five years, a strong team of women leaders, including Sgt. O’Connell, have helped me rebuild my life. They kept me safe. They stood by my side as I testified against six traffickers. I wish this had never happened to me. I wish no girl or boy was sold into sex trafficking. Yet, all this pain has led me to being able to truly empathize with each of the hundreds of girls who come to FAIR Girls every year. I hope someday to be a lawyer, and take my past and use my work at FAIR Girls to truly ensure fewer girls fall victim to sex trafficking. I am going to be honest with you right now. The state child welfare system failed me as a child. How is it possible a straight-A student like myself went missing and no one reported it? What about all those social workers and foster homes where I was abused and beaten? To start, we need three critical changes. First, we need critical funding to open specialized homes where girls and boys sold into trafficking can truly receive the compassionate care they deserve. Often times at FAIR Girls, we have nowhere for these young girls to go. We do our best with our partners, but many times we are hiding in hotels while looking for safe house. This is not how a victim of slavery who has just been freed should spend her first night. FAIR Girls and many social service agencies nationwide have the staff and vision to create specialized safe houses, but we need the resources to launch and sustain them. And, I think you could help us make that happen. Second, every social worker and teacher needs to be educated how to identify and assist child victims of sex trafficking. FAIR Girls is a member of the DC Anti Trafficking Task Force, and we have educated hundreds of law enforcement, social workers, and educators in victim identification. We can only truly keep American children safe if their adult support systems are educated and given the tools they need to understand the warning signs before a child is victimized. I often wonder what could have happened if one of my teachers or social workers had intervened and taken action to help me before I was sold by pimps all over America. This is not expensive training, but it’s lifesaving. Third, children, their teachers, and their social workers need to be educated nationwide on how to stay safe from sex trafficking. As the prevention education coordinator at FAIR Girls, I have educated thousands of teen girls and boys in foster homes, schools, and detention facilities. This curriculum has educated over 4,000 teens nationwide. Children in the child welfare system are most at risk and absolutely have to be educated on how to avoid being sold into sex trafficking. Had someone like me come to my school when I was 16, maybe my story of exploitation would never have happened. Recently, one young teen mom recently came to me saying she was being pressured by her older “boyfriend” to strip because she needed the money. I was able to join up with her school teacher and child welfare advocate to stop her fall into sex trafficking. FAIR Girls has hundreds of stories just like hers. We work closely with the DC and Maryland child welfare agencies, and this evidence-based partnership model could be emulated nationwide with the right resources. I appreciate the opportunity today to speak before you. And there are many more stories that I would like to share, as I believe passionately in the rights of the girl survivors that we serve at FAIR Girls. And I am very open to questions. I consider today the beginning of a wonderful dialogue that will lead to creating new resources to help girls just like me.","In 2004, at age 16, Asia Graves was trafficked in Boston and spent two and half years trapped in sexual exploitation. In 2009 she testified during a six-day trial that resulted in the conviction of two men at the centre of a major child-trafficking operation. They were both sentenced to 25 years in prison. Before testifying, she had moved to Tennessee, fearing for her safety, and returned to Boston only to speak at trial. In 2012 she moved to Washington DC and began work as the Maryland Program Coordinator and Survivor Advocate at FAIR Girls, a nonprofit group fighting sexual exploitation."
Withelma,2013 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Prior to being a college student, I spent for the most part, the first 18 years of my life in the foster care system. Seven of those years I was a child being sexually trafficked on the streets, internet, strip clubs, massage parlors and even in the back of express papers. Many children, like myself, come from various traumas previously to entering into foster care, and many times, are further exposed to trauma throughout their experience in the foster care system. Although there are many people who uplift the system for its successes, there are many elements within the experience of foster care that make youth more susceptible to being victimized. Youth within the system are more vulnerable to becoming sexually exploited because youth accept and normalize the experience of being used as an object of financial gain by people who are supposed to care for us, we experience various people who control our lives, and we lack the opportunity to gain meaningful relationships and attachments. In addition, traffickers / pimps / exploiters have no fear of punishment because they rely on the lack of attention that occurs when these young people go missing. Also, these traffickers / pimps / exploiters, depend on the instability of these young people’s lives to hide their involvement, which perpetuates the foster children and youth’s vulnerability. Many children, myself included, who grow up in foster care express how it is common household knowledge that many caregivers take them in primarily for the paycheck in which they are provided for the purpose of caring for the child. From my own experience and that of others, the money that is given by the state is supposed to be utilized to provide for the child’s basic needs—however the money is often used for other things, specifically for special luxuries for the caretaker and their biological children and families, unrelated to the financial support of the child it was intended for. These caregivers will make statements like “you’re not my child, I don’t care what’s going on with you, as long as you’re not dead, I’ll continue to get my paycheck.” This “nothing but a paycheck” theory objectifies the youth and the youth begin to normalize the perception that their presence is to be used for financial gain. This creates a mind frame for the youth that their purpose is to bring income into a household. In addition to the statements, the caregiver’s lack of action in times of need, imply to these youth that they are not concerned about what happens to them, as long as the paycheck keeps coming in. Nevertheless, this makes youth feel like an object and less like a person, and for me and many others, youth begin to normalize the behaviors and actions toward them by accepting that their purpose is for the financial benefit of others. Therefore, when youth are approached by traffickers / pimps / exploiters, they don’t see much difference between their purpose of bringing finances into their foster home and bringing money to traffickers / pimps / exploiters’ “stable.” Traffickers / pimps / exploiters also rely on how so many of us have been sexual abused and molested while in foster care. Back in my day, if I were to report abuse in a placement, I was often moved before it was addressed, only to preserve the opportunity to keep that placement open due to the lack of placements available. Sometimes, specifically more so with private FFA’s (Foster Family Agencies) and sometimes County/State Child Welfare Departments, do not thoroughly investigate caregivers’ background or family household. I once lived in a home in which a younger child and myself were being inappropriately pursued by the foster father. After we reported it, it was found that the FFA wasn’t aware that the foster mother was married and wasn’t aware that the man lived in the home. Furthermore, myself and many others, are stigmatized for reporting abuse. Once a youth makes such a report, that information is transferred within the disclosing of history to potential placements which makes it harder to place these children and harder for normal treatment within a home due to the fear of us making a “false claim” of sexual misconduct. Lastly, while I was in care, my social workers were aware that I was being exploited and did nothing about it. It is vital that foster children and youth be properly assessed and identified for sexual abuse/exploitation by child welfare agencies as there are many “red flags” that can be noticed if our agencies were supplied with the proper training. It is also important to point out here the ways in which the foster care system, inadvertently, objectifies the presence of youth for monetary purposes, and it also normalizes the idea to youth that other people are supposed to control their lives and circumstances. The foster care system, in its entirety, serves in the role of the parent so it is never clear to the youth who exactly is in control, or supposed to be in control. Multiple social workers fluctuate in and out of youths’ lives, and they have limited interaction with the youth which leave the children feeling hopeless and without a sense of order. Due to the multiple roles and persons in the foster care system, children and youth become accustomed to others (most of whom are strangers to them) dictating what will happen in their lives at home, in school and socially. Where they live, who they see, and what opportunities are available to them are at the mercy of multiple decisions made by adults with whom they have little or no attachment to. Foster care creates an ever changing environment of youth having to adapt to strangers making their life decisions. This is conducive to the parallel process of traffickers/pimps/exploiters who seek to keep control of a youth's life. Moreover the foster care system lacks and continues to eclipse opportunities for youth to gain meaningful relationships and attachments. Many foster children and youth switch placements so often that it doesn’t allow us to gain skills to acquire or sustain relationships and attachments. For others and for myself, opportunities to build these skills such as problem-solving, or what it means to reconcile after an argument, are denied and instead we are just moved to another home. These placement moves take away the opportunity to explore what a healthy relationship is and how to work through problems in a constructive way. Like me, any youth in foster care, becomes accustomed to adapting to multiple moves from home to home which allows us to easily then adapt to when traffickers / pimps / exploiters move us multiple times, from hotel to hotel, city to city, and/or state to state. For myself, as unfortunate as it is to say, the most consistent relationship I ever had in care was with my pimp and his family. Ultimately, traffickers / pimps / exploiters have no fear of punishment because they depend and rely on the lack of attention that occurs when these young people go missing from care. No one looks for us, or keeps us on their radar. The system just makes no effort. There are no amber alerts, no posters, when youth from the foster care system go missing. Traffickers/pimps/exploiters are aware that when foster youth go missing, it is always assumed by the system that they have willingly run away. There many opportunities to improve the foster care system so that girls like me, as well as boys, are less vulnerable to traffickers / pimps / exploiters. First, I believe child welfare agencies should be working with local programs which support and provide resources to youth who have been sexually exploited to enhance their responses with working with these youth to transition into a healthier lifestyle. Secondly, these youth should be provided trauma-informed counsel and care at all times, which means that the agencies should be actively working to gain and maintain the resources to do so. Working with these youth for the betterment of their well-being also consists of changing protocols in child welfare agencies. These youth should be able to have someone to call on at all times. The county agencies can set up a 24/7 cell phone hotline (in which the number would never be changed) to connect with a specialist or WOD (worker of the day) to respond and interact with these youth when they reach out. Lastly, child welfare agencies need to figure out how to make these children visible when they go missing. People will not be able to help these youth if they are not made visible. These youth also need to be actively involved in the decision making process of their life circumstances. Positive examples of youth involvement are proven. In California, TDM’s (Team Decision Meetings) and in New York, FTC’s (Family Team Conferences), are convenings in which many parties vital to the work of the agency, the young people and their families (biological and created) are brought together to make a plan that supports the youth’s individual goals and meets the needs of the agencies. I also believe that these youth should be appointed with one person who will follow them throughout placement changes whether it be a CASA or mentor, these youth should have a constant ally throughout their time in care and this person should also be available whether or not a youth is currently in placement. Finally, we need to ensure that these conversations are followed with Federal action from the input received here today. Personally, I feel there is so much more that can be done; these are just a few places to begin in the longer process of our Federal Government's partnership with nationwide child welfare systems in their effort to end the vulnerability of this population. I would like to thank the Human Rights Project for Girls, as well as the Chairman, and Members of the Committee for taking the time to hear my testimony. Thank you to all who work on behalf of these children. You are appreciated with all you do to end the vulnerability of all children.","Withelma Ortiz Walker Pettigrew grew up in the U.S. foster care system.

Angela,2013 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour Debt bondage,Philippines (trafficked from) Debt bondage,United States (slavery location),"My name is Angela Guanzon. I am from the Philippines. I came to the United States on a lawful visa with the promise of a good job. In the Philippines going to the United States is like winning the lottery. I was so excited to go I did not ask many question. When I got my visa to go to the United States my passport was taken and I was told it would be held for me until I got to the United States. I travelled with about 10 other workers to the United States. When I got to the US things were very different than I thought. I was told I owed $12,000 for my transportation to the United States and the visa. I was told I would have to work for 10 years to pay this off. I was then forced to work at a retirement home for the elderly located in a suburb of Los Angeles. I worked 18 hour days and had to sleep on the floor in the hallway. I am my co-worker, Jayson were threatened that if we tried to escape, I would be deported by calling the police and telling them that we stole something from her. This went on for two years. My experience shows that human trafficking happens today in the United States and that it happens to both men and women. Finally I was rescued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after a neighbor noticed that I never had a day off. I spoke out about what happened to me to the FBI and eventually testified against my trafficker in criminal court. She got a 5-year prison sentence. I am now a Certified Nurse’s Assistant and a member of the CAST Survivor Advisory Caucus, a group of survivors in California who are learning leadership and advocacy skills in order to raise awareness and influence policies to better protect and help survivors of human trafficking. I am also a member of the National Survivor Network (NSN) which has over 85 survivor members from 18 state around the United States. Because of my work with the Caucus and the National Survivor Network I know the type of abuse that happened to me and my co-workers happens to other people as well. I know about workers who came to the US on an H-2B visa and was promised a good job like I was but instead had to work in a hotel under threats of the police. Other workers came to the US on an H2-A visa to work in agriculture but instead ended up enslaved on farms around the US with armed guards keeping watch. I don’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. No one should believe they have to work for an employer night and day for 10 years after getting a visa to come to the United States. Workers like me need information and protection so when we take an opportunity to come to the United States we have our freedom like everyone else does. For this reason, I would like to thank Chairman Royce for taking such an important step and introducing HR 3344. I feel like he has really listened to what I and other survivors have seen as a grave abuse that can be prevented. I hope to work in the future to help pass this piece of legislation and I am proud to stand here today to speak on behalf of other survivors to a world more free of abuse. Too often we only hear about sex trafficking both in the United States and abroad and it's very important to me that the Committee is paying attention to all forms of human trafficking.","Angela Guanzon was brought to the United States from Bacolod City, Philippines, in 2005, to work at an elderly care home in California. But upon arrival she was told she owed $12,000 in fees, to be deducted before wages. She worked 18 hours a day and slept on hallway floors for two and half years. The FBI rescued Angela and several other workers in 2008. Angela testified against her trafficker in criminal court and the woman received a five-year prison sentence. Angela is now a survivor-organizer with the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST), a nonprofit organization that provided her with shelter and legal assistance."
Songhwa,2012 (Narrative date) ,Prison labour,China (slavery location) North Korea (trafficked from),North Korea (slavery location),"Hello, my name is Songhwa Han, and I came to the United States with my two daughters in 2008 as refugees, following the passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act by the U.S. Congress in 2004. For the lowest class people in North Korea, they have a most desperate and earnest plea. That plea is to be freed and liberated to freedom and human rights from the worst suffering and pain of starvation. I want to thank the U.S. Government for hearing our plea, for hope, and giving us freedom. I want to just describe very briefly my reasons for leaving North Korea. I escaped with my two daughters from North Korea for the first time in 1998. Before defection from North Korea, my family consisted of eight people. My mother and my two-month-old newborn baby son died from starvation, and my oldest daughter, who was 18 years old at the time, left home to find food and never came back. To this day I do not know of her whereabouts or what happened to her. I had another five-year-old son who I had to leave at an acquaintance’s home before I escaped to China. I promised my son, if you just sleep for five nights I will be back with rice and candy and I will come back to get you. Afterward, my five-year-old son, who was suffering from malnutrition, was kicked out of the house I had put him in and died while waiting and crying out, “Mommy, sister, when are you coming back?” He cried and cried, and died in a grass field. This news was delivered to me by someone I had hired to go and bring my son to China. My husband was arrested and sent to jail for the crime of crossing the Tumen River and going to China and bringing back a sack of rice, when what he had done was simply to go to China to find food for his children and save them, who had slowly over time grown weaker and weaker from starvation. He died while incarcerated in prison from the severe punishment he received. Afterward, my family was labeled as anti-state traitors for having crossed over to China and the North Korean police and the Bowibu, or the national or domestic security agents, came to look for us in our countryside village home. They came to kick us out of the village, for me to take the remaining family members and move away to another place. Our family had devoted ourselves to the Party and to the dear leader, but contrary to the police in the United States, instead of protecting the citizens the North Korean police yelled and threatened to burn down our house if we did not move out. I could no longer beg for help or for mercy, and I decided right then and there rather than staying put and starve to death, even if we died trying to go find our way to freedom, I decided to seek out freedom. My one sole wish was to feed my children just one meal of white rice, and decided that I would never suffer from starvation or be unfairly mistreated, and therefore took my seven-year-old daughter, who was malnourished and was not growing up properly, put her in a sack and carried her, and held my older daughter’s hand and leaned on one another and each other and crossed the waist-high currents of the Tumen River and safely escaped from North Korea. After escaping to China and living in fear for almost 10 years, during that period we were forcibly repatriated four times. During one of those forced repatriations, I would just like to share about my experience from the time I was forcibly repatriated during the summer of 2003. First of all, once a North Korean defector was handed over by the Chinese police to the North Korean Bowibu, or the security agents, one had to become an animal. Second, the defectors were repatriated or ordered by the North Korean guards that, “You are all dogs from now on, so therefore lower your head and move around by only looking at the ground.” The prisoners are handcuffed and chained to one another, and if the slightest noise is made the prisoners are beaten with rifle butts. After the interrogation is finished at the Bowibu, the prisoners are taken to a reformed hard labor camp, where I was sent. We were forced to work from 5 o’clock in the morning until late at night, and after dragging our dead-tired bodies back from work we were only giving a fist-sized corn/rice ball to eat, and until 11 o’clock in the evening we were required to participate in self-reflection and self-criticism group meetings and forced to sing patriotic martial songs. We would then spend the rest of our night sitting in front of one another and picking off the ticks and lice from our clothes and our hair, and then sleep for a few hours, and then wake up early in the morning to the wake-up call and then get dragged out for more labor. These types of punishments were given out to misdemeanor criminals. These punishments were repeated for as long as six months, and like men who would die from malnutrition and starvation and the women prisoners who collapsed from fatigue and could not get up again, both women and men alike had to carry heavy logs up to the mountainside. If a prisoner became injured there was no recourse for medicine or for medical care. In the wintertime there was no proper footwear available, so pieces of cloth and strings would be used to cover up the feet. While working in the snow, many would come down with frostbite, but we could not stop work and had to continue working, and also continue to work the following day.Sometimes the men had to shovel human waste from the latrines with their own bare hands. The women prisoners would then carry the human waste, mixed with dirt, on their backs and carry the load into the fields. So for the crime of going to China for only wanting to live and not die from starvation, North Korean refugees who are repatriated by China become prisoners and end up suffering under crushing labor, doing construction work or coal mining work, and become sick or injured, or worse, suffer in misery and pain and die while working under horrendous conditions. The wretched and poor North Korean refugees continue to suffer like this, and the misery is never ending.For the crime of betraying the nation, in the Bowibu, the domestic or national security agency prisons, the North Korean refugee men who were forcibly repatriated were beaten with steel pipes and countless people died from beatings inflicted on them, where arms and legs were broken. I, myself, was beaten in the head for the crime of having gone over to China, and I was beaten so severely that my skull still has pieces of bone imbedded in my head. Besides this injury, because I was beaten so severely and punched around so much, my eyes became swollen and one of my eardrums ruptured. To this day I am hard of hearing in one ear. While we were suffering from thirst, there was no water to drink and the prisoners would end up drinking foul water from the water tanks or wells and come down with colitis, and die without any care or treatment given to them. North Korean refugees, if they are miraculously able to survive and be released from prison or from the reform labor camps, will attempt to escape from North Korea even if it means death if caught again. Through this hearing today I earnestly plead and beg of you, refugees of other countries have been accepted in the United States numbering in the tens of thousands of people or more. But after the North Korean Human Rights Act passed in 2004, only about 130 North Korean refugees have been granted asylum in the United States. These defectors, who have been separated from their parents, separated from their children, these defectors who have no place to go, these North Korean refugees who are shuddering in fear in China right now and desiring freedom in the free world, whether it be South Korea or the United States, desire to be rescued and accepted into freedom. If 100 North Korean refugees were accepted after the Human Rights Act passed we would have more than 1,000 North Korean refugees in the United States by now. Those who long to go to the United States and who travel to Thailand and were incarcerated in the detention camps in Thailand, who long to go to the United States, because the wait period was so long, waiting for many months, they decided to change their destination to South Korea and ended up going to South Korea instead. I sincerely hope that the United States will accept the North Korean refugees, like South Korea. Being accepted into the United States is the wish of many North Korean refugees in earnest, and on their behalf I make this request to all of you here today. I pray that for those North Korean refugees who are in the period of uncertainty, that you will deal with China intensely and help rescue the North Korean refugees in China right now. Please help us, the North Korean refugees. Thank you.","Songhwa Han escaped to China from North Korea in the mid-1990s. After being detained in China, she was returned to North Korea, where she was held in forced labour in a state prison camp. While living in China as a refugee she also endured forced marriage, domestic abuse, detention, and official beatings. She received protection with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2006 and asylum in the United States in 2008. China has forcibly returned tens of thousands of North Korean refugees over the past two decades. Most have been punished in North Korea with beatings, torture, detention, forced labour, and sexual violence. China’s decision to forcibly repatriate them violates the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol."
Sam,2003 (Narrative date),Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I used to be a graduate student in Georgia State University in 1996. I’d like to share my personal experience to let people know why some products from China are so cheap. Before I returned to the USA in February 2001, I worked as a tax auditor in China for nine years. On June 7, 2000, I was arrested in China only because I handed in a letter at the State Appeal Bureau in Beijing to express my opinion about Falun Gong, which is a traditional exercise based on “Truthfulness—Compassion—Forbearance,” and is being persecuted in China. I was put in a jail in Guangdong Province for almost two months. Here I will not mention how the Chinese government persecuted family church members, Tibetan Monks and Falun Gong practitioners. I only want to let you know how some products from China are made and why they are so cheap. In prison, I was forced to work on export products such as toys and shopping bags without pay…The cell was only about 300 sq. feet in size, with 20 prisoners and one toilet inside. They slept and worked in the cell. Sometimes we were forced to work until two am to keep up with the schedule. They only provided two meals a day (only once a week you have meat in your food). In other words, being hungry, you still need to work more than 15 hours per day. The police used a wire whip to beat you if you did not do a good job or you could not keep up with the schedule. During this desperate time in prison, I was always wondering who gave them the business and who helped them to abuse us. Now the same kind of tragedy is happening to my wife. She was sentenced to forced labor camp for three years without any trial and without a lawyer only because she handed out flyers in the street to clarify to the Truth about Falun Gong. She has already been detained for more than 34 months. In my wife’s letter to my parents, she mentioned that she was forced to do embroidery work for export. The hard work, malnutrition and torture made my wife almost lose her eyesight.In that female labor camp alone where my wife is detained now, about 3000 female Falun Gong practitioners have been detained there and forced to work for export business. According to human rights organizations, there are more than 100,000 Falun Gong practitioners detained in China’s Forced Labor Camps. How many people other than Falun Gong practitioners are detained in forced labor camps and prisons and are forced to work without pay for China’s export business? Who knows? ","Unknown numbers of people have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps). Human rights organizations claim that Falon Gong practitioners are often targeted for arrest, along with ethnic minorities, Catholics, Protestants, and Tibetans. By some estimates around 100,000 Falon Gong practitioners have been sent to the Laogai. Sam Lu was one of these individuals. Sam, who now lives in the US, was imprisoned in 2000. He wrote his story to help end the ongoing enslavement of his wife in a different Chinese labour camp."
Dina,1999 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"I came here today as a woman, a Khmer woman. I came here today to tell you my story, in the hope that after you listen to me you can understand my situation and the situation of thousands of Khmer women and other women around the world. It is very difficult for me to come here and speak to you; but I am doing this because I want you to listen, to me the real person; and I want you to remember me and what I say to you today when you are in your offices talking about policies and strategies that affect me and my sisters. I want you to remember we are not “problems” we are not animals, we are not viruses, we are not garbage. We are flesh, skin and bones, we have a heart, and we have feelings, we are a sister to someone, a daughter, a granddaughter. We are people, we are women and we want to be treated with respect, dignity and we want rights like the rest of you enjoy. I was trafficked, I was raped, beaten, and forced to accept men. I was humiliated and forced to be an object so men, yes men, could take their pleasure, I brought profit to many and brought pleasure to others. And for myself I brought shame, pain and humiliation. But worst of all I receive demeaning comments from you: you discriminate against me, you give yourselves a job because of me and you are busy thinking about the best way to protect the community from me. The police come to Toul Kork almost every day. They always have a reason to come, but they come more frequently before festivals like Pchum Ben, because we are an easy target to extract money from. In a public forum the chief of these police stands up and states, “We do not arrest the girls”: lies and more lies. They arrest us and take our money, our jewelry, sometimes even our few possessions we have in our room like our bed covers. If we cannot pay then they detain us for a day or two, they give us no water. When they are convinced we simply have no money to pay they take us to another brothel and sell us to a newpimp, usually for $100 for one girl. Then we become indebted once again and have to pay off that debt to the new pimp. This is trafficking. The police, yes, the police sell us for another cycle of slavery. Do you think it is in their interests to see my occupation decriminalized? Of course not: then they lose their share of the money. In one day we pay almost 15,000 riel [$3] in bribes to the district police, to the municipal authorities and the local authorities. Then another group of police come and arrest us. If we do not run and hide we are re-sold to slavery. Your solution is to ask these people to protect us. Think again. They live off our blood. Money is too important to everyone, money and more money. It is not enough to eat: people demand more because they want nice things. I come from a poor family; they sent me to study at a cultural school in Phnom Penh. I was living with a family but I could not contribute to my living, so they helped me find a job in a nearby hotel washing dishes. This hotel had many sex workers. But I just washed dishes and went to school. One night a man followed me when I was on my way home and raped me. I was only 17 years of age. You cannot imagine how I felt and what impact this had on me. But after that, I was lured to becoming a sex worker under false promises. I was sent to Stung Treng; I was beaten when I refused to accept men. Shortly after I was taken to Stung Treng a man came to pay for me to go with him. He paid my maebon. He took me to the pig slaughter house where he worked and locked me in a dirty smelly cell. Then he came back with six other men. They all, one by one, raped me; one man raped me twice. After a whole night of gang rape I was faint with pain. When the morning came I heard the workers preparing to start their work. I heard the pigs being pushed into the pens, they were screaming. I knew what that feeling was like: I was no better than the pigs to these men; they could have killed me. Something inside me did die, and I will never be the same. I am 24 years old and my life has been like this since 1993. I did not know the Khmer Rouge years but I have heard the stories of suffering. People say they were slaves. Compared to my life for the last five years I think I and my sisters have suffered and are suffering more than you have. I know starvation, I know slavery, I know being forced to work all day. But I also know physical violation and torture every day, I know discrimination and hatred from my country-people, I know not being wanted and accepted from my society, the society that put me in this condition. I know fear, I feel it every day, even now that I dare speak my life is in danger. This is a crime, but no one is punished. I fought the Khmer Rouge, I was a soldier fighting to protect you from the Khmer Rouge and risking my life. I fought for the freedom of the Cambodian people, this is what the commander told us we were to do and I was proud I was fighting for freedom. I fought for your freedom—only to become enslaved and abused by you. After all these years I now work as a sex worker. I also run a union to unite sex workers to fight for basic rights and for freedom. We bring our voices to forums like this to educate people like you, with the hope you can learn from us. Many of my sisters are scared to join our struggle because they live in constant fear of abuse and threats. Some of you think that I am bad because I choose to remain a sex worker. My answer to those people is: I think your society, my society, my motherland Cambodia, is bad because it does not give girls like me choices; choices that I see are better for me. I think it is bad that my country allows men to rape young women like me and my sisters and go unpunished. I think it is bad that my society lets men seek and demand the services of women like me. I think it is criminal that we are enslaved to make money for the powerful. I think it is bad that my family are so poor and getting poorer because they can not survive as farmers with little resources which are getting smaller because more powerful people move them off their land. I think it is bad the police treat me and my sisters like we are criminals but those who exploit us and take our dignity, our money and sometimes our lives live in freedom, enjoying their lives with their families. Because why? Because they have a powerful relative, because they have money. Is this right? Is this justice? My sisters and I we do not create the demand, we are the objects; the demand comes from the men, the men come to us. We are cheated, deceived, trafficked, humiliated and tortured. Why? Because men want us and we bring money to the powerful. But we are the powerless. You give us AIDS; when we are no longer profitable you leave us to die, but we do not die in peace: you point your finger and you blame us. You, the development organizations, give us condoms and teach us all the time about AIDS. We do not want your words, we do not want your judgment, we do not want you to tell us what is better for us. We know about AIDS; we watch our sisters die from the disease. Ask us if we have the power to demand condom use from our clients. Look at me: you see a woman, but my boss sees dollars. An extra payment to my boss and the client does not wear a condom. If I protest I receive a beating. If I die tomorrow no one cares: there are many other girls who will be tricked and trafficked like me, because we feed many people. I do not want to go to your shelter and learn to sew so you can get me work in a factory. This is not what I want. If I tell you that you will call me a prostitute. But those words are easy for you because you have easy solutions to difficult problems you do not understand, and you do not understand because you do not listen. My life has become this way now; for me there is no turning back, so let me continue to practice my occupation, but recognize my occupation and give me my rights, so I am protected and I can have power to demand justice. I am a post Khmer Rouge child But was a slave I was forced to work against my choice My body is tortured I am full of pain I am not a citizen I am not a person You see me as a virus I am invisible Your eyes do not see me You hate me You blame me Some of you pity me I do not want your pity","In 1993, Dina Chan was exploited in northern Cambodia. Women are internally trafficked for sexual exploitation in Cambodia, usually from rural areas to the country’s capital, Phnom Penh, and other secondary cities. Cambodian women are also brought to Thailand and Malaysia for commercial sexual exploitation. An orphan who got into debt for overdue rent payments and tuition fees, Dina was trafficked from Phnom Penh to Stroeung Treng at the age of 17. Her narrative describes police corruption, starvation, and gang rape. She points out the irony that she fought for others’ freedoms as a soldier, “only to become enslaved,” and rejects the response of “pity” to her story. She also issues a call for prostitutes to unionize and “fight for basic rights.” On behalf of herself and her “sisters,” Dina demands recognition of her humanity: “We are people, we are women and we want to be treated with respect.”"
Patience,2004 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery Sexual exploitation,Togo (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Ghana (slavery location),"I want to now be called Patience. This will be my new name because I want to forget about all my past and start a new identity in life. I was about ten years old when I was brought across the border to become a trokosi. I was abandoned in the shine by my relatives for the rest of my life. When I was being brought I was given no reason, I only remember that I had a lot of beads on my waist. I brought a bundle which was stuffed with a stool, cloth, broom, plates and some other items, placed on my head to carry for the journey. We crossed the border into Ghana, and when we got there I was taken through some rituals and was finally left in the shrine. My relatives came from Togo to visit me a few times but I never saw my mother. They only told me she lives at Togo. At the shrine there were some other trokosis but I was the youngest. They sent me on errands and gave me food to eat. Later I started joining them to the farm. My education ended when I came to the shrine. When I grew up, I asked the priest why I was brought to the shrine in Ghana, because my relatives came from Togo to visit and I got to know that I belonged to a different country. He said I came to atone for the death of my relatives who were involved in a land litigation case with another party. My relatives were cursed at the shrine for trying to possess a piece of land which did not belong to them. Many people had died, including my father. I was therefore brought here so that people would stop dying rapidly under strange circumstances. I was not given any definite time to serve at the shrine, after which I should return to my country. Life had the shrine had not been easy. As a child, I had to fend for myself, apart from going to farm for the priest. My basic needs were provided by myself. I went to the bush to cut trees and burnt charcoal for sale. I also sold firewood. As a trokosi you had no rights over the fruits of your labor. We were threatened that if you earned money for yourself you would die. Thus whatever we sold, we gave it to the priest. He collected all the money, and if it pleased him, he would determine how much to give you. I saved and bought soap, food, panties, etc, from this. The only times that I worked extra hard to make some money off farming was when some fruits were in season. I picked baba fruits from the bush, which I pounded for sale. I picked mangos for sale when it was season. When I became an adolescent and had my second menstruation, the priest instructed me to be sending food to his younger brother in his hut. One day when I sent the food again, he seized me and raped me. I cried and complained but was told to shut up. This continued until I got pregnant. I later realized that it was an arrangement between the priest and his brother. I had a baby girl later. I continued to cohabit with him and now I have three children. My husband does not take care of us. He beats me up mercilessly and there is nobody to complain to. I enrolled my children in the primary school in town and they are schooling. When life became tough for me, I decided to run away from the shrine for a while. The priest heard this and he cautioned that the curse I came to redeem from my family would follow me. Misfortune would follow me and I would fall sick and die. I was frightened but later on gathered courage to leave my children and go, because we were hungry. I followed a woman from our community to Accra. She gave me some money which I paid her later. I slept on the floor in a long room with many other strange people. The next day I paid for the floor, a bucket of water for my bath, and rented a bowl. I joined other porters. We carried loads for people and they paid us what we bargained with them. I saved some money from this and send some provisions and clothing to my children. While I carried foodstuff for one of my customers one day, she engaged me in conversation. She sympathized with me. She requested that I leave that job and work with her to sell eggs. I felt very sick and returned to the shrine. The priest said it was the curse and he told me would follow me. I went through some rituals. When I recovered I left for Accra again, because I was committed to paying the debt to the egg-seller. I explained my problem to the operator and we entered into an agreement that she would pay the debt while I would work for her for one year without pay. She would however provide me with free meals. I had joined the woman for four months, when I heard my daughter was very ill. She gave me some money to buy provisions and send my daughter to the hospital. When my daughter recovered a little I returned to Accra but paid her visits with money from my employer. I had worked for the woman for about eight months when I had information to return to the shrine to be liberated from the trokosi system. I was liberated on the 9th of July, 2002."," The system of trokosi (“wife of the gods”) has existed in the Volta region of rural Ghana for centuries. During the late 1990s, numbers reached to around 6000 trokosi, most native to Ghana. It also exists in Togo, Benin, and southwestern Nigeria. Fetish priests who run shrines insist that only by handing over a virgin daughter—typically aged between eight and 15—can families atone for alleged offences committed by their relatives or ancestors. These offences range from murder to petty theft. Once the girls are handed over, priests turn them into slaves and impregnate them repeatedly. They are beaten when they try to escape, and are denied education, food, and basic health services. Most remain in slavery for between three and ten years, some for their whole lives. If they die, the family must offer another virgin daughter, and if they are ever released, former trokosis are considered unmarriageable. Any children born to trokosi become slaves, and trokosi are passed on to the next priest upon one priest’s death. Until July 2002, Patience was a trokosi, brought from Togo to a shrine in Ghana at the age of ten. She was released by International Needs-Ghana, which has liberated several thousand trokosi from shrines across southeastern Ghana since 1996. The trokosi practice was banned in Ghana in 1998, but enforcement of the ban has been ineffective: officials are hesitant to restrict the practice because they view it as an integral part of their religious beliefs, and fetish priests claim the right to preserve their forefathers’ culture. Togo and Benin have done little to stop the practice, and practitioners in Ghana bring girls from these countries. Several former trokosis now campaign against the practice."
Ker,2011 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"My name is Ker Deng, and from a time I can’t remember until very recently, I slept with cattle and goats. I ate the grain that was fed to horses. I was treated worse than the animals I slept with. Like them, I was property. I was a slave held in Northern Sudan. But the animals weren’t beaten every day. I was. Every single day, with a horsewhip. Sometimes on my front, sometimes on my back. Sometimes with my clothes on, sometimes not. But every day. The animals were fed every day. But I wasn’t. To the man who owned me and my mother, the animals had worth. They were valuable. We weren’t. My mother and I were captured when I was too little to remember. My mother told me how it happened: Of the day Arab raiders from the north came to our village. They burned our huts. They killed the men. They stole the livestock. They tied the rest of us to camels and dragged us to a life of slavery in Northern Sudan. Our slave masters were named Zacharia and Mariam. They gave me a name: “Cattle-Keeper.” That’s why I had to sleep in the shed with the goats and the cattle. They’d tie my ankle to a goat, so I’d be awakened if they tried to get away. At least I had a grass roof over my head. My mother had to sleep outdoors – in the garden – so she could keep animals away from the family’s crops. Zacharia and Mariam had five children, some of them older than I was, some younger. When they went to school, I would go into the fields to pick red tea. I was fed with the horses. Once in a while, I was given watermelon or vegetables to eat. I remember being told, “This is your food for the next few days.” When I was very small, I couldn’t control the goats. That’s usually why I was beaten, but not always. Zacharia drank. And whenever he got angry, I got a beating. My mother could do nothing to help me. She’d be locked up, and if she resisted in any way, she was beaten, too. When he was drunk, Zacharia would call me an infidel and make me recite Muslim prayers. I still remember them. I want to forget them. I’d like to forget all of it, but I can’t. The worst thing Zachariah did was to blind me. He was dissatisfied with my work looking after goats and sorting red tea leaves. I was beaten and hung upside down from a tree. Zacharia rubbed chili peppers in my eyes and built a fire under me so the smoke would make the pain even worse. I almost went crazy because the pain was so bad. I was saved by a neighbor, an imam named Bakit. He felt sorry for me and cut me down from the tree. He took me to his home, and he let me stay there several years. In the beginning, I could still see. Bakit even had me sort red tea leaves for him. But because of the peppers, my sight gradually got worse, and after a while, I became completely blind. First I lost sight in one eye and then in the other. My mother always told me, “Do not forget who you are. You are Dinka man, born in the South, and your father still lives in the South. Don’t forget your language and who you are.” As far as I know, my mother is still being held in Northern Sudan, and she’s only one among many. I often saw other Dinkas in the same situation we were in, but was never allowed to talk to them. My mother never gave up hope. She used to say to me, “I know we are living in a bad situation, but maybe something will work itself out.” I think of my mother every day, and what she is probably still going through. I pray to give her the strength to survive -- and to give you the courage and wisdom to find some way to gain her freedom. I would like the people of America to know that Southerners are still being held in the north, and they are still being treated worse than animals. And I bring you a message from them, and from me: I want to see my mother again, in freedom, along with all the others being held in slavery in Sudan. You are powerful men and women. Please, find some way to help. Thank you for your time and consideration.Narrative as told to the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights of the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, October 4, 2011","Ker Deng, one of the Dinka people of Southern Sudan, was captured into slavery as a child during Sudan's civil war. His father had died and he was captured alongside his mother, Angel Mangok Diin, and taken to the North by raiders. He was blinded by his slave-holder, Zakaria Salih, as punishment for letting a goat escape. Unfit for work, he lived with a neighbour then in 2010 was handed to slave retrievers who return former slaves to the South. In 2011, a sponsor enabled him to resettle in the United States. His mother remains enslaved."

Holly (Narrative 1),2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"When I was fourteen years old, I was coerced into prostitution by a man I had met at a local shopping mall in New Jersey. This man exploited a young teen girl who had just graduated eighth grade middle school and was afraid of going into high school, so afraid that she agreed to run away from home. This man promised a glamorous new life; he told the girl she could travel across the country, meet famous people, and live in Los Angeles, California. What he delivered, however, was very different. He took the girl to Atlantic City, ordered her to prostitute, and intimidated her into cooperation. She was sold to the first buyer for $200, a man who told the girl that she reminded him of his granddaughter. When I was arrested by law enforcement for prostitution, I was made to feel like a criminal, like a juvenile delinquent. I felt stupid, ashamed, and ostracized by society. Days later, alone in my bedroom, I felt so abandoned, so forsaken by society, that I attempted suicide. I wish I could travel back in time to tell this young girl that, years later, advocates and legislators all across the country would be standing up for her, that they would demand better protection and services for kids like her. Had there been a Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act or Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act in 1992, perhaps law enforcement would have immediately recognized that I was a victim, not a criminal. Perhaps they would have assigned a victim’s advocate to accompany me through the process of cooperating with and providing testimony to detectives. Perhaps funds from the proposed Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund could have enabled me to immediately enter effective aftercare treatment and remain there until I fully understood that what had happened to me was not my fault. Perhaps my healing process could have been easier, faster. And perhaps my family and I could have had an easier transition. Even though these protections weren’t available to me, they can be made available to victims today. With effective and well-informed legislation and services, victims can heal, overcome, and achieve their greatest dreams and highest potential. However, without effective services, it is very difficult to heal. This is why I encourage legislators to include provisions that authorize resources for services for all victims of human trafficking and child exploitation – girls, boys, men, and women. Without effective services, victims may return to exploitative situations and youth may be returned to abusive situations from which they had originally run. While youth may escape juvenile detention, they may not escape continued abuse or sexual exploitation. This is particularly true in states implementing safe harbor protections where law enforcement cannot adequately respond without well-resourced service providers trained to work with child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. In order to create effective anti-trafficking bills, solutions, and services for victims, I encourage legislators and advocates to consult with many survivors having diverse experiences – no single experience can represent all situations of sex or labor trafficking. Male, female, and transgendered survivors; survivors who were children when exploited and those who were adults; and survivors who were U.S. citizens and foreign nationals when exploited – each survivor has a different experience, a different perspective, and a different insight into effective programs that can prevent exploitation, protect victims, and prosecute traffickers and other exploiters. This is why I support the Human Trafficking Survivors Empowerment Act, which would create a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal government policy and programs on human trafficking. It is so important that survivors play a role in finding the solutions to prevent and end sex and labor trafficking. Many survivors, including myself, agree that policies on prevention should be one of our highest priorities, which is why it should also be a priority for policymakers. In my book, Walking Prey: How America’s Youth are Vulnerable to Sex Slavery, I discuss many predisposing risk factors that can increase a child’s vulnerability to a sex trafficker’s tactics, as well as community risk factors that can increase the likelihood of crossing paths with a trafficker or other exploiter. With effective community programs, we can prevent human trafficking and child exploitation from happening in the first place. One predisposing factor I mention in Walking Prey is being a youth with minority status, including LGBTQ youth. Nikolaos Al-Khadra is a male advocate from Chicago who identifies as a survivor of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. Nik says he was forced into prostitution at the age of seventeen; he had been ordered to leave home after accepting his identity as a gay male. “I grew up with [a lot] of emotional and physical abuse,” Nik states in a personal email. He describes a home life in which his father regularly attempted to “’beat the gay out’” of him. He writes: “I drove to the gay area of Chicago. I had parked my car, met some other kids who were hanging out on a street named Halsted. I had went back to my car to get something not paying attention and was snatched from my car.” Nik then describes a hellish experience of forced drug use and forced prostitution. He says: “I think with the obvious signs of just leaving home, my personal bags in the car and being oblivious to my surroundings [I was vulnerable]…These men are predators [who] prey on kids like myself who were either like me throw-away youth or runaway.” After managing to escape, Nik says he then returned to “’Boystown’” and “networked” with others on the street. He says this ultimately led him to illegal escort agencies through which he was exploited for sex in order to survive. Nik writes: “There really needs to be more programs for LGBTQ youth who become homeless over parents attitudes [toward their] child’s sexuality. I think being beat down mentally all throughout my childhood was why I stayed years in the sex trade.” If Nik was in the room, he would tell you that the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act (RHYPTA) is a necessary step toward preventing sex trafficking and protecting runaway and homeless youth. And I would agree. Many youth in America face homelessness for various reasons, including running away or leaving home to escape abuse or neglect. The National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) estimates that, on an annual basis, approximately 380,000 youth under the age of eighteen “experience a homelessness episode of longer than one week.” The NAEH further estimates that about 50,000 youth in America “sleep on the street for six months or more.” Included among homeless youth are LGBTQ youth who may run away to escape discrimination within their homes or communities. The NAEH explains that “[m]ultiple research studies indicate that a conservative estimate finds 1 in 5 homeless youth self-identify as…LGBTQ.” A 2001 University of Pennsylvania study reports a “place holder” number of 3,000 regarding transgender youth living on the streets of America…; however, the authors say they believe the actual number to be “much higher.” There are many advocates like Nik and myself who experienced some form of human trafficking or child exploitation. In the Washington DC area alone, we have survivors like Evelyn Chumbow, Barbara Amaya, Tina Frundt, Withelma “T” Ortiz Walker Pettigrew, and Tanya Street, all of whom are authors, founders of organizations, or college students. Evelyn, for example, is a survivor of domestic servitude as a minor; she is now attending the University of Maryland studying Homeland Security. We are all eager to share our thoughts and perspectives in order to transform our negative experiences into positive change. Thank you again for holding this hearing and for inviting a survivor to share testimony. I hope the survivor community, advocates, and policymakers can continue to work together to combat human trafficking and child exploitation and to stand up for victims across the country.","Holly Austin Gibbs (formerly Smith) is a survivor of child sex trafficking and an advocate for survivors of all forms of human trafficking. In 2011, Holly submitted joint testimony to Congress with labour trafficking survivor, Ima Matul, in support of reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Holly also testified before the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations on the connection between sporting events and sex trafficking. In 2015, Holly testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of two bills: Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act and Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act.

Barbara,2014 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Barbara Amaya and I am a survivor of trafficking.I spent the first 12 years of my life in Northern Virginia. When I was only 10 years old, family members abused me. Before the abuse I was a pretty normal little girl: I loved to read, collect stamps, draw and I was a member of the Barbie fan club. Unfortunately, after I was abused, I became a different little girl. No one helped me or validated the abuse I had suffered, so part of me went into hiding and I became depressed. I didn’t want to be around anyone, no longer went to school, and eventually ran away when I was 12.When I ran away, I was a walking target for traffickers and predators who look for damaged children: I had been abused, I was depressed and was in desperate need of help. It didn’t take long for traffickers to find me. Surprisingly it was a couple – a man and a woman – who found me on the streets of Washington D.C. They took me off of the streets where I was hungry and alone and brought me into their home where they fed me and seemed to care for me. That is, until they initiated me into the world of trafficking. They used me for a few months until they no longer needed me and then sold me to another trafficker. Right in our nation’s capitol, I was sold into trafficking to a man named Moses. Soon after buying me, Moses took me to New York City where he trafficked me for 8 years.During my time on the streets of New York I was abused, shot, stabbed, raped, kidnapped, trafficked, beaten, addicted to drugs, jailed, and more all before I was 18 years old.To ease my pain, I became addicted to drugs. This habit became very expensive and I was no longer a valuable commodity to my trafficker, so he released me into New York. It was terrible; I was addicted and alone in the city. Thankfully, at a methadone clinic where I had sought treatment, I met a woman named Anita who helped me to find my sister who had apparently been living in the nearby city of Philadelphia and that Christmas, she helped me reunite with my family.After a very difficult time detoxing off of methadone I started to slowly get my life back. I lived in Washington State, Mississippi and eventually came back to Virginia where I got married and tried to have a baby. Soon after I starting trying to have a baby, I found out that because of all the trauma I had endured on the streets, I was infertile. Somehow, I think it was a miracle; I was able to have treatments and can happily say that I was able to have a daughter.In all of that moving around and having my daughter, I kept my past a secret. No one knew about the years I had been trafficked or abused but me. Then one night, when my daughter was 15, she decided to run away. My past came rushing back to me and I was so afraid that the same things that happened to me would happen to my daughter. I couldn’t just sit around, so I spent the whole night making phone calls and looking for her. Thankfully, I found her the next morning and, shortly after, told her about my story. After that, she never ran away again and she is doing well today. I have a wonderful grandson and I live a content and quiet life.I believe I am alive today because God watched over me all those nights on the streets. He kept a part of me untouched inside – despite all the men and all the trauma I endured – a part of me remained clean and whole. I call that part of me my soul.I choose to believe that I went through all that I did, so that today I can help others. If I can educate one person or give hope to one victim of trafficking, then I am doing my job and everything I went through was worth it. I choose to be a victor not a victim – not just to survive, but to thrive. Today I tell my story whenever I can so I can help others.Narrative as written for the Richmond Justice Initative. ","Barbara Amaya is an award winning author, advocate and survivor.

Trong,2012 (Narrative date),Forced labour Debt bondage,Vietnam (trafficked from) Debt bondage,China (slavery location),"My parents and my whole family are farmers. The reason why I decided to go to China to work was because someone came and said there’s a lot of money to be made. If there was a lot of money there, I wanted to go to make a little money to help out my parents. When I got home and first met that aunty she said it would be easy housework near the border. The work would be for a couple of months and then I’d be home again. She said I should try it out for a while and if I could not do the work and if I wanted to go home, then I could easily do so. When I first got there, I didn’t know what kind of work was in store for me. I’d been there for 2 or 3 days when I met a few other Vietnamese people. I became acquainted with them and they told me, “All of us Vietnamese people have been deceived.” At the time I felt very upset, but the reality was I was so far from home and didn’t have the money to get back. The work there was physically demanding, tiring and required heavy lifting. The work was dangerous at times because after the bricks had been fired in the kiln, and had to be removed, if we weren’t careful they could collapse and spill out. We had to pay for everything. Even the two mats they gave us, we had to put money together to pay for them. They said that the expenses had to be paid for, “For you transportation, food and accommodation. Your wages don’t even cover the costs and now you’re demanding money?” When I got home I felt angry that I could be cheated by someone from my own family. I have learnt a lesson, that from now on, whenever people talk about going away for a job, we need to be cautious whether they are our relatives, or strangers, we can’t trust just anyone. I want you to know it’s not just women and girls who are deceived by these people.  As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," China remains a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subject to forced labour. There have been a number of media reports exposing cases of forced labour in the country, especially among the disabled whose families are unable to care for them and with an underdeveloped government support system leaving them vulnerable. The disparity of work opportunities between rural and urban populations has created a high migrant population vulnerable to human trafficking. The lure of a higher income leads many migrant workers to accept jobs in China without knowing exactly what they entail. Trong went to China from Vietnam after his aunt told him he could get housework near the border. He was told he would work for a couple of months and then return home. However upon arrival he was told by other Vietnamese workers that he had been deceived. Trong had been enslaved into debt bondage in a brick kiln, forced to work to cover the costs of transportation and accommodation. Eventually Trong along with his friend Lin were able to escape."
Vannak,2014 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Cambodia (trafficked from),Thailand (slavery location),"I decided to go and work far away from home, because my family was very poor. My wife was seven months pregnant and we had no money for the baby’s delivery. At that time, I decided to leave home to find a job at the border. The motor bike taxi driver said, “There are no jobs except drying fish, if you don’t go, you’ll have to pay for this motorbike fare, and you’ll have to give the recruiter 400 baht.” At that time I didn’t have any money so I had no option but to go. I was locked up when we arrived there by a few Thai guys, and they moved their fingers like this and said, “Bang! Bang!” So we didn’t dare to run away. When I got onto the boat I was scared. A Thai killed a Lao many by cutting his throat, and dumping him into the water. Sometimes we worked 3 days and nights straight. If we took a rest we would be beaten. They kicked, hit and cursed at us. The owner beat me because I kept asking him to let me go home. I never received any salary. I worked on the boat for over 3 years. I escaped with a Thai worker. It took 20 minutes to swim away. When I reached land my goal was to go back to Cambodia. The only goal I had was to go back home. [Vannak is using art to share his experiences] I draw these because I want to illustrate what I experienced. I want to draw these so that my neighbours and those who have never been there will not be deceived like me. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Men, women and children are victims of human trafficking for forced labour in the Thai fishing industry. Enslaved people are subjected to physical abuse, excessive and inhumane working hours, sleep and food deprivation, forced use of methamphetamines and long trips at sea confined to the vessel. Due to the fishing industry relying on trans-shipments at sea to reduce expenditure, some find themselves trapped on long-haul trawlers for years at a time. This makes the monitoring of enslaves labour on fishing vessels costly and difficult. The Thai Government has faced severe pressure to tackle forced labour specifically in the fishing sector, with the European Commission threatening a trade ban in 2015 for not taking sufficient measures to combat illegal and unregulated fishing that would cause the loss of up to US$1.4million a year in seafood exports. As a result the Government have reportedly accelerated efforts to combat labour exploitation, however despite this most workers in the Thai fishing sectors remain unregistered. Vannak sought work away from home in order to provide for his family. He was offered a job by a taxi driver drying fish in Thailand and told that if he refused he would have to pay for the journey, money he did not have. Vannak was locked up and forced on to a fishing boat where he worked for 3 years under the constant threat of violence and never receiving any salary for his work. Eventually, Vannak escaped, swimming twenty minutes to shore and making his way back to Cambodia and his family."
Vatsana,2014 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,"",Thailand (slavery location),"When I was a child my family was poor. My parents were farmers. The reason I went to Thailand, was because my family didn’t have enough to get by. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family. I met a woman. I knew her through a friend of mine. I trusted my friend and I made a quick decision. She persuaded me to work in Thailand near the Mekong River. She said I would work with her relatives. There was a factory. They needed people to work with them, for 3,000 baht per month. I believed her  I arrived at a two-story house. My room was near the dog’s room. It was a small room. I woke up at 4 or 5 in the morning. There was so much work to do I wouldn’t finish until 7pm. If I was slow she shouted at me. When she was not satisfied with my work she would slap me.  She would lock the door. She said if I went out the police would arrest me. I thought that if I obeyed her I’d have a chance to go back home. People rarely walked by because the house was at the end of the road, so I had no chance to ask for help. At the end of the month I asked for my salary, but she said she bought me for 8,000 baht. More than 10 years passed and I still didn’t get any money. I found a rock and tied it with a rubber band. When I got a chance and the owner was not at home, I threw it over the fence. The rock landed on the road. When the rescue team arrived it was 5pm. She made me hide under the bed. They walked past the bed. I flicked on of them and they looked down. I felt really happy because I knew that I was going home. I stayed at that house for over 16 years. I never got any pay. To all the employers – if you want to hire, wither domestic or international workers, treat us like human beings. Pay us our money, it’s ours. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," It is estimated that 425,500 people are enslaved in Thailand, with the many subjected to forced labour. Women overseas-workers most often find employment in private households or service sectors, finding themselves having to pay significant fees for the migration and recruitment process. Domestic servitude is also prevalent with the majority of enslaved being women from rural Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Victims are often physically and sexually abused, confined to the house and find their pay and identity documents withheld. Vatsana was offered a job in Thailand working in a factory. However, upon arrival she was taken to a private home and forced to work from 4am to 7pm every day. Vatsana experienced physical abuse daily and did not earn any money for her work. Finally, one day after over 16 years of enslavement, Vatsana was able to get a message over the fence and was rescued."
Xiaoxiang,2013 (Narrative date),Children,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"He asked me if I like turtles or not. I said yes and he told me that he could take me to buy a big one. He took the small turtle and lured me behind the central square. He also bought me some medicine to eat. I didn’t want to do anything after taking the medicine. He managed to get rid of my brother and took me on a bus. We changed buses later. We took the bus again and when we got off, it was already dark. We took the double-decker bus and slept at night. In the morning we got off the bus and went to someone’s home. We went to someone’s home, and the person hit me every day. They hit me a lot. I remember him beating me when I was taking a shower. He hung me upside down and hit me. He grabbed my feet, hung me and hit me like this.","Minority children and those from very poor families are extremely vulnerable to trafficking in China. A highly organised practice exists where couples have children for the very purpose of selling them. Children from minorities are also deceived into trafficking under the false promise of work in hospitality, construction and manufacturing but are instead forced to engage in criminal activity or prostitution. There are also an estimated 1.5 million children currently enslaved as forced beggars in China. Xiaoxiang, a young Chinese boy was playing with his brother in his front garden when he was abducted for illegal adoption domestically. Xiaoxiang was rescued by police working on another child abduction and reunited with his family."
Zakir,2011 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",India (slavery location),"I used to feel sorry for myself… “Why did I come to Mumbai?” If I hadn’t come then this would have never happened to me, I would have never been sold. We were extremely poor. There was no one to earn money in my family. After my dad died, my aunt came to my house. And she told my mother “I will take him with me. In Mumbai I will educate him.” So my mother agreed. That’s why I came. To study. How was I to know that she was going to sell me? My aunt said “Are you just going to study or do you plan to work as well? I’m going to make you work at the zari factory next door. You better work properly there.” I think my aunt sold me because she wanted more money. They used to hit me with the bed frame, and I had marks on my body from it – big black marks. They used to hit me on my back, on my arms and on my legs. They used to say, “C**t, mother f*****r, F**K you! Keep quiet or we will beat you.” “You pimp! You want money? What money? You pimp. A**hole.” She would abuse me and hit me and say go back to work. She would tell my boss, “Don’t let him out. Make him work.” I want every child to study. Studying is very important. If you study you will succeed. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," India has a population of more than 1.3 billion people, there are still at least 270 million people living on less than US$1.90 per day. While laws, systems and attitudes regarding key 'fault lines' such as the caste system, gender and feudalism are rapidly changing, social change of this depth and scale necessarily takes time. In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, including intergenerational bonded labour, forced child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced recruitment into non-state armed groups and forced marriage. Zakir travelled to his aunt’s house in Mumbai where he was told he would get an education. However upon arrival he was forced to work in the zari factory next door. Subjected to physical and verbal abuse daily, Zakir received no money for his work. Eventually Zakir was rescued by an anti-trafficking organisation and went back to school."
Bella A.,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Women,Albania (trafficked from) Women,United Kingdom (slavey location),"I wasn’t thinking actually to go abroad but just when you met people and they give you any opportunity, and then you started thinking maybe it will be a good idea. So I met a friend of someone that I know that I was looking for a job because I couldn’t survive to pay my rent and he give me the idea of going in Belgium and working in restaurant. The man arranged everything. I was in Belgium for two days. I didn’t see anything suspicious to make me feel uncomfortable or. But then they say now we’re going to see the work and they took me to a lorry. They forced me to go in there. And when they forced me to go in they took everything, so I didn’t have anything with me. No identity no passport or ID, nothing. I had nothing. I was no one. I didn’t know where I’m going, I didn’t know I was going to be a part of trafficking, sex trade. The only thing that came in my mind, when they sell organs and they kidnap people, they kill them, they use their organs and they sell them. So only this thing came in my mind, nothing else. [...] I was terrified, I couldn’t breathe I was suffocated but I couldn’t talk. I couldn’t even scream you know because I was scared. And the journey, I think it was about 10 hours. 10 horrible hours. [You arrive in the UK. Have you got any idea where you’re going?] No. [...] They say er welcome to the UK, we are in UK. They took me to a apartment, to a flat. They didn’t treat me bad at the beginning but then they start erm to explain me how is it, how it works, what I was going to do. And makes me feel, and embrace it like a normal, normal thing. Just your life has changed, this is your life. This is what you have to do, you don’t have to be scared, you have to co-operate and makes things easy. More easy for you, more easy for us. It’s good for everyone. They say it’s nothing what you haven’t done before just you have to do it as a business, and you’re going to take your part of money, it’s profession you have to do it. It’s just a profession, you have to see it as something normal. So we will find the customers, you have to do the job and then we share the money. If you don’t, if you try to escape, then we will find you and you can imagine what’s going to happen to you and maybe to your family. The first 10 days they didn’t put me through all this, they tried to convince me. And after I was like rejecting and saying I’m not going to do, then they put me on drugs and then alcohol. [...]  I, I thought how you can make a business with a human body? With a woman, a woman body. How can you call that business? [The day Bella escaped] I was really sick that day, really, really sick but er I was really lucky because I found, I found 5 seconds opportunity to leave and I just left. I was without shoes, nothing. And I just ran and ran. I ran about 2 hours I think. And then erm I stopped in a shop which I though, I felt like er safe. Lucky there was a doctor in there and he asked me what’s wrong what’s going on. And I said I’m on drugs, someone drugged me and so then they called ambulance and the door stay with me until the ambulance came, they took me to hospital. And there the police, came because I didn’t know, I know who I was but I didn’t know where I was, what I was doing. [...] No passport, no nothing. I just had my jeans on and a blouse and that’s it. [...] Oh yeah, this police officer Kate, I think Kate, yeah it was a lady called Kate. She was really nice with me and she say we’re going to take you somewhere after we finish with the hospital. It was about half past 3 in the afternoon I think and we get to the convent half past 3 in the morning. Sister Ensie had prepared a bed for me and I fell asleep ‘til 11. When I wake up Sister Ensie prepared a breakfast for me and I felt like family, you know the love at the first sight that happens? For some people you can love them from the first sight and Rahab was love at the first sight. And not without reason. Because they are beautiful in heart and they become my family later on. So they were the first person who see me as a human being, they didn’t victimise me let’s say. [...] Bella: I wasn’t treated as a criminal, I wasn’t treated as a poor victim. But as woman, as a human being that has rights to have care in the most difficult days. [...] I just needed like love, unconditional love. Being loved from people, being appreciated, not that I’ve done, I haven’t done anything to be appreciated, but they were amazing people. [...] Rahab is my, let’s put it this way, without Rahab I wasn’t going to be what I am today, because they invest in me so much, they invest in me love, care time. Everything they have got in their hands they invest in me. So I was really lucky. I was the first girl they took care of and erm I hope one day will feel proud of me. As told to Rahab Adoratrices"," The UK is a destination for men and women from Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East often seeking better livelihood opportunities. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries, of whom 61% were female. The majority of adults classified as victims of sexual exploitation and the largest proportion of victims was from Albania. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Bella was living in Albania when her marriage failed and she became estranged from her family. During the financial crisis beginning in 2008 Bella’s business began to struggle, so she began to look for work. Not originally planning to go abroad, Bella was offered an opportunity to work in a restaurant in Belgium. However, when she went to go and see the work she would be doing, she was forced in to a lorry and her documents were taken off her. The lorry took Bella to the UK where she was forced into sexual exploitation. She was able to seize a window of opportunity one day and ran for two hours to freedom. She was taken by police to Rahab Adoratrices, a charity founded in 2009 to care for women affected by human trafficking for sexual exploitation."
Shyima,2014 (Narrative date),Children Domestic slavery,Egypt (slavery location) 2001-2004 Domestic slavery,United States (slavery location),"Hello everybody, I’m so sorry I’m late it was the flight I promise. [laughs] let’s see erm well my name is Shyima Hall, I’m going to begin telling you guys who I am and why I do this, and erm in the end, if you have any questions, you’re more than welcome to ask me.  Let’s see erm, like I said my name is Shyima Hall, erm I was a victim of human trafficking and I’m here to share my story with you guys, I was born in Egypt, I was also number 7 of 11 kids, big family. Erm I had a family of erm, they were very poor family, but it was a happy family and I was okay with it. My childhood was in Egypt, a very nice childhood. I had friends, I had my brother and sisters, family, erm it was a wonderful experience for me [laughs]. Erm I had a sister that worked for a family in Egypt. She was the oldest of my family, of the kids. She was actually at twin of two girls erm, let’s see erm, before I go into her job and what she did, erm let you know that Egypt law for labour work is when you’re age 14, boy or a girl, you’re allowed to work, your parents is allowed to marry you to whoever they think is suitable for you. Erm and er, you’re a grown person by age 14. Let’s see she worked for a family in Egypt as a maid by choice, she chose to work for them, she was, it was her job. Just like us going to work in the morning but she lived with them. One day she decided to steal money from them. And erm when she stole money from them, erm she ran away after that, they called my parents, my mum showed up to the family’s house. And let explain to you guys, the family’s house is or who they, how they are. They’re a very very wealthy family. Erm their house is probably half of this campus, that’s how wealthy they are. Erm they had 5 kids, 3 girls and two boys, twins. Erm they erm, very powerful people in Egypt. Let’s see so she worked for that family and when they called my mum in, they said hey, you’re daughter stole money from us and we want to be repaid or we’re going to send her to jail. So as a mother’s first instinct in her case she said, oh you know, here’s my daughter in her, in her spot. And erm, she will repay all her money by erm, by working for you guys. They said that’s great. She’d young, we can teach her, erm everything we want to the way we wanted to, and she wouldn’t talk back. Erm so that was a great thing for them, that I was 8 years old at the time. Even though it was still against Egypt law, it was fine by them. So my job was to, pretty much was to take my sister’s spot. And to repay her debt. Erm, I stayed with the family for almost a year and a half in Egypt. My job was to wash dishes, erm help around with the twins which were the youngest two boys they had, erm clean around the house, do what I was supposed to do, been told to do. Erm my, my family didn’t even contact me throughout those years. Maybe once, and that’s because as a kid I cried and I missed them. And then they got hold of them. I wasn’t the only person that worked for them in Egypt, they had other people in the house as well, actually about maybe 5 to 7 other people that worked there, but they were all adults. All by choice. Erm two, a year and a half afterwards passed, and they decided that they were erm gonna move to the US because erm they had got in some trouble with the government in Egypt. When they decided to go to the US they said hey, you’re daughter hasn’t finished her debt. She belongs to us still. And erm, again my parents said yeah, she’s she still belongs to you guys, you know. And they told me, hey you’ll be there for maybe 7, 6 months, maybe less than that, and then you’ll come back home. As a kid I mean, I didn’t know like right from wrong. I did what my parents told me, as you know, you think your parents, they know what’s best for you so you follow their lead. They signed all the paperwork, erm they even taught me how to erm, when I’m getting my passport like, passport to say ‘oh this guy is going to adopt me and that’s why I’m going with him to the US. They played out all, what was necessary to make it okay where no one will question them. They erm, they thought of everything. And I just went along with it. When I was leaving, I got to see my parents once, for the last time I ever see them. And that was at the airport. Erm they, they said goodbye and erm, we’ll miss you and be good and listen to what you’re told. And pretty much that was it, I’ve never seen them again. I went on a flight with a man that I met only once before, the guy acted that he was my parent, erm and he sat way in the front of the airplane and I was way back there like, had nothing to do with me, and erm we went through different flights and different arrangements and finally we were in the US, in Irvine. Erm is where I met the parents, erm again and he just pretty much like a package, he handed me over. Erm I went through security yin the airport like nothing. It was, you know the guy didn’t even notice, because the guy that was with me he was mixed with Arab and half white and so he looked nothing like me whatsoever. Erm no one ever questioned him, nothing. It was like oh okay, here you go. A guy kind of looked at me and looked at my passport and then he turned around and said oh we’re going to Disneyland, and that was it. Then I got hand to the parents and erm they took me to their house. Erm I, I was still confused honestly. I was still like you know hey, this is going to be for a little bit I’m gonna go back home. Erm, they took me to their house and showed me this is where you’re gonna to work. Pretty much, you’re going to take care of the kids. Now I’m the only worker they have. Erm, and erm, pretty much like do what you, what we tell you and end of story, you’re not allowed to go outside, you’re not allowed to talk to anybody else. I mean, I only spoke Arabic at the time, I didn’t speak English to be able to communicate with anybody else. Erm, I, they showed me where I lived I erm, I stayed in a room in the garage. It had a bed, it had a blanket, and a light. And the light, you know eventually broke and I lived the rest of the years with no light in that room but erm, erm that was my sleeping arrangement and they thought that was perfectly fine to treat a human being. Erm, sorry. I, I did my labour work which was in my case for human trafficked slave, was I was labour work, I wasn’t sexually abused or anything I was only abused by verbally, slapping, smacking. Other people actually go through worse when they’re slaved, if they’re sexually slaved. Erm, I hated where I lived, I woke up in the morning at 5 in the morning get the kids clothes ready, erm get their erm, lunches their breakfasts, get the kids all ready for school and that was my , that was my day. I woke up, I got up, I cleaned the house, they had two story house, 4 bedroom on top and erm they had about two other living room on the bottom, a computer room, bathrooms. And my job as a 9 year old was to do all that and to clean and as they, do as they told and as human beings they thought that was right to treat another person. And the amount of two years I lived with them I got to speak to my parents twice. And erm the first time I cried to my mum and was like hey, I want to come back home I can’t do this anymore, they’re verbally abusing, everything it’s just horrible. And she turned around ‘oh you’re okay, you’re almost done paying your sister’s debt, you have to do this for the family. You should think of your family.’ And I couldn’t say anything else, you know that’s what my mum is telling me. I got off the phone and the dad goes up to me and he’s like don’t you ever complain to us, complain about us to your mum. So they, he was on the other line listening. He was like how dare you, we give you the world. We treat you as one of the family. And I couldn’t imagine this how family treat each other. Erm… erm I lived with them how miserable was. But… sorry… with the way they treated me the way they, the mum go up to me and says, remember you’re nothing compared to who we are. And that was her way of letting me, you know, hey, you stay in your place and that’s it, this is your place for you to work for us and to pretty much do what you’re supposed to. I went to, I took the kids to parking, I took the kids to the pool around the neighbourhood. No one ever would notice me either. I was a kid with [crying] ripped clothes, erm looked miserable and you can just tell… and no one ever looked at me… and this is why I do the talk that I do, for people to understand that you can help somebody else. [Crying]. I had one neighbor come up to me once at the park and ask the little boys ‘hey, who is she?’ and they said, they were taught to be like ‘she’s your stepsister, so she’s just here with my dad so she’s going to be leaving soon’. So they even taught their own little kids, their youngest little boys to say like, hey this is, this is part of our family you know, they’re not doing anything wrong. Erm [crying] the two years I had to, were the most miserable two years of my life. I finally erm, a neighbor you know, noticed me and called and said hey there’s a kid that erm lives in this house, very young, never see her go to school erm, see her anything. See her just up. And erm I guess took the police 3 days to go around the house and to be okay, there’s something wrong in the house to come in. Erm and you can’t even imagine the day I was rescued. Honestly it was the worst day ever at the time, I thought. Because here there’s bunch of cops coming to the house, and you’re always drilled in your head to be, if anybody would ever take you, any police officers, anybody will talk to you, they will just put you in jail because you’re not supposed to be here. You will never see your family again. They’re going to beat you until you’re just, nothing else is left of you. And the mum would tell me that all the time, all the time in my head. And all I can think of when they came through those doors is like, my life is over. I thought it had it hard then, but I thought, oh man the worst is coming. [crying] Erm, the dad open the door, and he said, you know they spoke in English I didn’t really understand what was going on other than the dad telling me in Arabic you know like go away. And erm I erm, I walked away and all I heard was you know the door shut, and they didn’t come in. And erm it took maybe 5 more minutes and erm, the cops knocked on the door like crazy again. I guess they needed a warrant and warrant to come in, in the house. And all I heard was just yelling, bunch or yelling like crazy, and I didn’t understand anything of it. Erm and as they took me outside the house, the dad goes and tell me in Arabic ‘don’t you dare tell them you, you work for me’. And they were just trying to push him away from me. Erm no nobody at the time was able to communicate with me and tell me what’s going on. They had to go and get somebody that spoke Arabic to erm talk to me on the phone and be like ‘hey, you know it’s going to be okay, these people are here to help you. So just go with them’. And the first thing they did was, they put me in a marked cop car and that’s the one thing I’m always point at, see these, these are the things that you don’t get near, these are the things that are gonna take you and that’s it for you. And so I was, I was frightened I was just like, this is it for me. Erm I ended up being taken to a, an erm it’s called Orangewood, back in Orange County and it’s like a group home. And I got placed there and erm it was a day later, the cops came by and they got my parents on the phone and erm my parents instead of erm res, like pretty much making me feel better or anything. The first word out of my dad’s mouth was ‘How dare you to leave these people’s home. These are the people who put a roof on top of your head. Cared and treated you as family’. I remember being so angry to hear these words from him, it was… [Shyima is passed some water] thank you… it was very hard to hear those words from him because I just thought like, he really has no idea what these people put me through. Staying up ‘til 2 o clock in the morning to finish cleaning the house, to doing their laundry, to them pushing me around, to tell me I’m nothing. And that’s when he tells me I was part of their family… I remember one time when I was in the family’s house, when I first got there. I washed my clothes into the washing machine, and she goes and throw my clothes on the floor and says, you’re clothes are dirty, you don’t mix it with, with our clothes. And she give me a dish, soap like you wash the dishes with and a bucket and that’s how I washed my clothes. Because my clothes were dirtier than theirs. [Crying] I’m sorry… no matter how many time I do this I still… erm but yeah, my dad was like be thankful, pretty much. And he put my mum on the phone and she was like ‘you’re gonna give me a heart attack, you’re gonna kill me. You’re supposed to stay with these people, you’re supposed to be thankful for what you have. And these people have helped us so much’. And I came to find out I guess they’d been giving them a little extra money I guess, to help them out. And the same sister that stole the money from them and I was in the situation with, she got married with the money they give them extra. Erm I honestly, I had nothing to say to them. I was just really hurt, there was a bunch of cops around me, an Arabic speaker that was translating what’s going on to them. And I was just crying and telling him like, dad these people are hurting me non-stop. And he’s like ‘well you should be thankful for what you have’. And they end up, the cop end up taking the phone and they hanged up on them, they were like, you don’t need to listen to them. Erm they came by a few days, I was still terrified of what was going on around me. I refused to talk to the cops and they kept on asking me the only way we help you is by you talking to us and telling us what’s going on. Now I’m, I’m scared, I’m like what if I go back to this family again? What if they win and they take me back? What they gonna do? They’re probably gonna show me the worst all over again because I even dared to say something. And all I can say to the cop is like nope, I was fine, I was just visiting just you know, don’t worry about it. And they couldn’t do anything else because I wouldn’t talk. But again that’s another thing with victims, they don’t know what to do with themselves, they always scared their going to go back to where they were. Their emotions are all build on the things you’re always told and the things you’re always told are going to happen to you.  I end up going to foster care through the system and I went through 3 different foster parents. Erm I was a teenager, not many foster parents want to really take in a teenager. You never, you never know what you’re going to get with it. Erm I had my first foster parents they were Arab because I didn’t speak any English, and I stayed with them actually about 3 years. Erm it didn’t end up working out because they said I was becoming way too much of a teenager. Erm and I guess you’re given, you give a kid a candy and just got hyper with it I guess, erm I was excited to know what was out in the world, I wanted to learn everything. Now through all this I was Muslim, I wore my scarf I practiced my religion very well, I prayed so God can get me into a better place. Erm my first foster parents were very hardcore Muslims as well. Erm so since I was becoming too much of a teenager they moved me along to my second foster parents, I was no longer in California, I moved all the way to San Jose for my second foster parents. Erm I was still not, erm trying to learn and going through school systems and they were another foster parents that were Muslim and they spoke Arabic too. I didn’t last long with them, I stayed only for a year. Erm and erm I moved along from them to my third foster parents which was erm in Cali, back to California because I was a ward of Orange County. Erm, through every foster parents you know, you go through the problems and me growing up and trying to learn everything else around me and my third foster parents I didn’t want to be a Muslim anymore and I took my scarf of because I was getting bullied in school and kids would pull my scarf off of me. Erm just spit on me, it was horrible so I decided I keep on going through all these things because I believe in a faith that’s really not getting me anywhere. It’s not even just the Muslim part it was just me thinking of God, hey you know, this is not working out pretty much. And erm I decided to take my scarf of and going through that was a lot different for me to because I had a hard time with is because I thought you know I’m going the worst right now, not believing in what I had always been taught. Erm my second, my third foster parents were American. They spoke full on English, not Arabic and erm and that’s from where I got the last name Hall. I got adopted by them and I carried their last name. I had my problems with them where after my, now came 2007 is when I started having my little problem with them because my case was coming to an end and I finally decided to speak to the police officers, it took me from 2001 to 2007 to speak to the cops and tell them really what happened. Erm the agent they really didn’t give up on the case, erm they wanted to put them in jail really bad because they knew what they were doing was wrong and they were like this happened in our own back yard like this shouldn’t happen so close to home, so they didn’t give up on the case.  I went erm through court and they decided that they weren’t going to put me on the stand erm for trial because my own sister erm the one that started everything else, was coming to testify against me and because erm this family were wonderful to her and they’d, they stood by her they did everything so great for her. So I was the wrong one. Erm so the lawyers worked really hard not to have me go through all that because I was still like you know going through all my emotions, like I was going through all the pills to put me to sleep because I would never sleep. Any pills to make me happy. Erm and erm I went through the case and erm the day of the trial was, it was really hard because it was my first time every seeing them again, the family. And the mum got up first and spoke and said, she was very determined and angry with the judge, stood up and told him you know, ‘shame on you, you have us come to court on a holy day’ because it was Eid at the time, ‘and taken us away from my family and my kids’. Erm I, I wasn’t planning on getting up and speaking, but when I got up and I, I spoke and I said, I told her how dare her to say that you took us away from my family and friends on a holy day when she took my whole childhood away from me. Took me away from my family, my friends, even, we were poor, we had nothing, it still was my family, my life. And she took that away from me. She was very upset that the judge had the court date on Eid. And that’s really all I had to say to her, pretty much shame on you. The good thing about the case, they were, they plead guilty so they weren’t able to get as big a sentence, but the good thing is they still went to jail. She went to er 22 months of that’s how long she had me, for 2 years and the dad went for 3 years to jail. I was the first case being, for human trafficking being ever solved in Orange County and in California. They didn’t get a lot of jail time but the community and the police officer they all learned a lot from it to, for the next victim how to help them right and how to make things go along a lot faster. Erm I, I’m happy where I am now. I’ve been through all that and erm I have a wonderful daughter, she’s 2. She makes me happy. Wonderful little girl. And this is why really I do most of my talks, because I never want her to grow up in such a horrible world. She’s… I would kill for her and that’s how I would want everybody to look around and to be like, if you see something, do something about it. Because of that neighbor, I’m here today to speak to you and to tell you about my story and to let you know how awful things are out there and what other people go through. And there’s a lot worse case than mine. I was blessed because I had people behind me and they helped me along with it, I was very a determined person to be like, I was given an opportunity to stay in the US and I’m gonna do everything I could do to make it worth. To give back what was given to me, my life. And to have a wonderful life. Erm I really don’t have much to say. There’s a lot more to everything but erm, if you guys have any questions you’re free to ask me.   As told to Sam Houston State University Global Center for Journalism and Democracy","Egypt is a source, transit and destination country for women and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation. Egyptian children are recruited for domestic and agricultural labour with some of these children facing conditions indicative of involuntary servitude such as restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats and physical or sexual abuse. Families in remote villages across Africa send their children to work in cities for extra money, a custom that has led to the spread of trafficking as wealthy Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate to the US. It is estimated that 10 000 forced labourers in the US are trapped in domestic servitude. Shyima was just 8 years old when her family sold her into slavery to settle a debt. She was then smuggled into the US and held as a domestic slave in California. She was denied medical care, proper nutrition, an education, and her childhood"
Shandra (Narrative 3),2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Indonesia (trafficked from) Debt bondage,United States (slavery location),"I arrived in the United States in the first week of June, 2001. To me, America was a place of promise and opportunity. As I moved through immigration I felt excited to be in a new country, albeit one that felt strangely familiar from movies and TV. In the arrivals hall I heard my name, and turned to see a man holding a sign with my picture. It wasn't a photo I cared for very much. The recruitment agency in Indonesia had dressed me up in a revealing tank top. But the man holding it smiled at me warmly. His name was Johnny, and I was expecting him to drive me to the hotel I would be working in. The fact that this hotel was in Chicago, and I had arrived at JFK airport in New York nearly 800 miles away, shows how naive I was. I was 24 and had no idea what I was getting into. After graduating with a degree in finance, I had worked for an international bank in Indonesia as an analyst and trader. But in 1998, Indonesia was hit by the Asian financial crisis, and the following year the country was thrown into political turmoil. I lost my job.  So to support my three-year-old daughter I started to look for work overseas. That was when I saw an ad in a newspaper for work in the hospitality industry in big hotels in the US, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. I picked the US, and applied. The requirement was that I could speak a little English and pay a fee of 30m Indonesian rupiahs (in 2001, about $2,700). There was a lengthy recruitment process, with lots of interviews. Among other things they asked me to walk up and down and smile. ""Customer service is the key to this job,"" I was told. I watched through the window as the new driver gave Johnny some money - I thought, 'Something here is not right' I passed all the tests and took the job. The plan was that my mother and sister would look after my little girl while I worked abroad for six months, earning $5,000 a month. Then I would come home to raise my daughter. I arrived at JFK with four other women and a man, and we were divided into two groups. Johnny took all my documents, including my passport, and led me to his car with two of the other women. That was when things started to get strange. A driver took us a short way, to Flushing in Queens, before he pulled into a car park and stopped the car. Johnny told the three of us to get out and get into a different car with a different driver. We did as we were told, and I watched through the window as the new driver gave Johnny some money. I thought, ""Something here is not right,"" but I told myself not to worry, that it must be part of the way the hotel chain did business with the company they used to pick people up from the airport. But the new driver didn't take us very far either. He parked outside a diner, and again we had to get out of the car and get into another one, as money changed hands. Then a third driver took us to a house, and we were exchanged again. The fourth driver had a gun. He forced us to get in his car and took us to a house in Brooklyn, then rapped on the door, calling ""Mama-san! New girl!""  By this time I was freaking out, because I knew ""Mama-san"" meant the madam of a brothel. But by this time, because of the gun, there was no escape.  The door swung open and I saw a little girl, perhaps 12 or 13, lying on the ground screaming as a group of men took turns to kick her. Blood poured from her nose and she was howling, screaming in pain. One of the men grinned and started fooling around with a baseball bat in front of me, as if in warning. And just a few hours after my arrival in the US, I was forced to have sex. I was terrified, but something in my head clicked into place - some kind of survival instinct. I learned from witnessing that first act of violence to do what I was told.  The following day, Johnny appeared and apologised at length for everything that had happened to us after we had parted company. He said there must have been a terrible mistake. That day we would get our pictures taken for our ID cards, and we would be taken to buy uniforms, and then we would go to the hotel in Chicago to start our jobs. Day and night, I just drank beer and whisky because that's all that was on offer - I had no idea that you could drink the tap water in America. ""We'll be OK,"" he said, rubbing my back. ""It won't happen again."" I trusted him. After the bad things I had just endured he was like an angel. ""OK,"" I thought. ""The nightmare is over. Now I'll go to Chicago to start my job."" A man came and took us to a photo studio, where we had our pictures taken, and then he drove us to a store to buy uniforms. But it was a lingerie store, full of skimpy, frilly things, the like of which I had never seen before. They were not ""uniforms"". It's kind of funny, to look back on that moment. I knew I was being lied to and that my situation was perilous. I remember looking around that shop, wondering if I could somehow slip away, disappear. But I was scared and I didn't know anyone in America, so I was reluctant to leave the other two Indonesian girls. I turned, and saw that they were enjoying the shopping trip.  Then I looked at my escort and saw he was concealing a gun, and he was watching me. He made a gesture that told me not to try anything. Later that day our group was split up and I was to see little of those two women again. I was taken away by car, not to Chicago, but to a place where my traffickers forced me to perform sex acts. The traffickers were Indonesian, Taiwanese, Malaysian Chinese and American. Only two of them spoke English - mostly, they would just use body language, shoves, and crude words. One thing that especially confused and terrified me that night, and that continued to weigh on me in the weeks that followed, was that one of the men had a police badge. To this day I don't know if he was a real policeman. They told me I owed them $30,000 and I would pay off the debt $100 at a time by serving men. Over the following weeks and months, I was taken up and down Interstate 95, to different brothels, apartment buildings, hotels and casinos on the East Coast. I was rarely two days in the same place, and I never knew where I was or where I was going. These brothels were like normal houses on the outside and discos on the inside, with flashing lights and loud music. Cocaine, crystal meth and weed were laid out on the tables. The traffickers made me take drugs at gunpoint, and maybe it helped make it all bearable. Day and night, I just drank beer and whisky because that's all that was on offer. I had no idea that you could drink the tap water in America. Twenty-four hours a day, we girls would sit around, completely naked, waiting for customers to come in. If no-one came then we might sleep a little, though never in a bed. But the quiet times were also when the traffickers themselves would rape us. So we had to stay alert. Nothing was predictable. Despite this vigilance, it was like I was numb, unable to cry. Overwhelmed with sadness, anger, disappointment, I just went through the motions, doing what I was told and trying hard to survive. I remembered the sight of that small girl being beaten, and I saw the traffickers hurt other women too if they made trouble or refused sex. The gun, the knife and the baseball bat were fixtures in a shifting and unstable world. Physically, I was weak - the traffickers only fed me plain rice soup with a few pickles, and I was often high on drugs They gave me the nickname ""Candy"". All the trafficked women were Asian - besides us Indonesians, there were girls from Thailand, China and Malaysia. There were also women who were not sex slaves. They were prostitutes who earned money and seemed free to come and go. Most nights, at around midnight, one of the traffickers would drive me to a casino. They would dress me up to look like a princess. My trafficker would wear a black suit and shiny black shoes, and walk silently alongside me like he was my bodyguard, all the time holding a gun to my back. We didn't go through the lobby, but through the staff entrance and up the laundry lift. I remember the first time I was ushered into a casino hotel room, I thought perhaps I would be able to make a run for it when I came out. But my trafficker was waiting for me in the corridor. He showed me into the next room. And the next one. Forty-five minutes in each room, night after night after night, the trafficker always waiting on the other side of the door. Because I was compliant, I was not beaten by my traffickers, but the customers were very violent. Some of them looked like they were members of the Asian mafia, but there were also white guys, black guys, and Hispanic guys. There were old men and young university students. I was their property for 45 minutes and I had to do what they said or they hurt me. What I endured was difficult and painful. Physically, I was weak. The traffickers only fed me plain rice soup with a few pickles, and I was often high on drugs. The constant threat of violence, and the need to stay on high alert, was also very exhausting.  My only possession - apart from my ""uniform"" - was a pocketbook [a small handbag], and the things it contained. I had a dictionary, a small Bible, and some pens and books of matches I pilfered from hotel rooms, with the names of the casinos on them. I also kept a diary, something I had done since I was little. Writing in a mix of Indonesian, English, Japanese and symbols, I tried to record what I did, where I went and how many people were with me. I kept track of dates too, as best as I could. It was difficult because inside the brothels, there was no way for me to know if it was day or night. My mind was always thinking about escape, but the opportunities were so rare.  One night I was locked in an attic in a brothel in Connecticut. The room had a window that I found I could open, so I roped the bed sheets and my clothes together and tied them to the window frame, then clambered out. But I got to the end of my makeshift rope and saw I was still a long, long way from the ground. There was nothing for it but to climb back up. Then, one day, I was taken to the brothel in Brooklyn where I had arrived on my first day in the US. I was with a 15-year-old Indonesian girl I'll call Nina, who had become a friend. She was a sweet, beautiful girl. And she was spirited - on one occasion she refused to do as she was told, and a trafficker roughly twisted her hand, causing her to scream.  We were talking with another woman who was in the brothel, who was the ""bottom bitch"", which means she was sort of in charge of us. She was being nice, saying that if we ever got out I should call this guy who would give us a proper job, and we would be able to save up some money to go home. I wrote his number in small piece of paper and I kept it safe. And it was while she was talking about our debt - the $30,000 the traffickers said we had to pay back - that I just started to freak out. I felt sure I would die before I ever served 300 men. I closed my eyes and prayed for some kind of help. Not long afterwards, I went to the bathroom and saw a small window. It was screwed shut, but Nina and I turned all the taps on loud, and, my hands shaking, I used a spoon to unscrew the bracket as quickly as I could. Then we climbed through the window and jumped down on the other side. We called the number we had been given and an Indonesian  an answered. Just like the bottom bitch had said, he promised to help us. We were so excited. He met us and checked us into a hotel, and told us to wait there until he could find us jobs. He looked after us, bought us food and clothes and so on. But after a few weeks he tried to get us to sleep with men in the hotel. When we refused, he phoned Johnny to come and pick us up. It turned out he was just another trafficker, and he, the bottom bitch, and everybody else were all working together. This is when I finally had a stroke of luck. Near the hotel, before Johnny arrived, I managed to escape from my new trafficker and I took off down the street, wearing only slippers and carrying nothing but my pocketbook. I turned, and shouted at Nina to follow me, but the trafficker held on to her tightly. I found a police station and told an officer my whole story. He didn't believe me and turned me away. It was perfectly safe for me, he said, to go back on the streets with no money or documents. Desperate for help, I approached two other police officers on the street and got the same response.  Outside the brothel, there were detectives, armed police and a Swat team with sniper rifles lurking nearby.  So I went to the Indonesian consulate, to seek help getting documents such as a passport, and some support. I knew that they had a room that people could sleep in in an emergency. But they didn't help me either.  I was angry and upset. I didn't know what to do. I had come to the US in the summer, but it was getting towards winter now and I was cold. I slept on the Staten Island Ferry, the NYC subway and in Times Square. I begged for food from strangers, and whenever I could get them to listen, I told them my story, and I told them that there was a house nearby where women were imprisoned, and that they needed help. One day, in Grand Ferry Park in Williamsburg, a man called Eddy bought me some food. He was from Ohio, a sailor on holiday. ""Come back tomorrow at noon,"" he said, after I had gone through my tale.I was so happy I didn't stop to ask him what ""noon"" meant. I knew from school that ""afternoon"" meant PM, so my best guess was that ""noon"" was another word for ""morning"". So early the next day I went to the same place in the park, and waited hours for Eddy to return. When he finally came, he told me he had made some calls on my behalf. He had spoken to the FBI, and the FBI had phoned the police precinct. We were to go that minute to the station, where the officers would try to help me.  So Eddy drove me there, and two detectives questioned me at length. I showed them my diary with details of the location of the brothels, and the books of matches from the casinos where I had been forced to work. They phoned the airline and immigration, and they found that my story checked out.  ""OK,"" they said in the end. ""Are you ready to go?""  ""Go where?"" I asked.  ""To pick up your friends,"" they replied.  So I got in a police car and we drove to the brothel in Brooklyn. To my relief I was able to find it again.  It was just like a scene from a movie, except instead of watching it on TV I was looking out of the window of a parked car. Outside the brothel, there were undercover police pretending to be homeless people - I remember one of them pushing a shopping trolley. Then there were detectives, armed police and a Swat team with sniper rifles lurking nearby.  I can enjoy it now, but at the time I was very tense, and worried that the police would enter the building and find that nothing was happening there that night. Would they think I was lying? Would I go to jail, instead of my persecutors?  A police officer dressed as a customer pressed the buzzer to the brothel. I saw Johnny appear in the doorway, and, after a brief discussion, swing open the metal grille. He was instantly forced back into the blackness. Within seconds, the whole team of police had swept up the steps and into the building. Not a single shot was fired.  An hour passed. Then I was told I could get out of the car and approach the building. They had covered one of the windows with paper and cut a hole in it for me to look through. In this way, I identified Johnny and the girls working in the brothel without being seen. There were three women there, Nina among them.  Let me tell you that when I saw those women emerge from the building, naked except for towels wrapped around them, it was the greatest moment of my life. Giving birth is a miracle, yes, but nothing compares to the emotions I experienced as my friends gained their freedom. In the flashing blue and red lights of the police cars, we were dancing, yelling, screaming for joy!  Johnny was charged and eventually convicted, as were two other men who were caught in the following days. I still needed support, though, and an opportunity to heal. The FBI connected me with Safe Horizon, an organisation in New York that helps victims of crime and abuse, including survivors of human trafficking. They helped me to stay in the United States legally, provided me with shelter and connected me with resources to get a job.  I could have returned to my family in Indonesia, but the FBI needed my testimony to make their case against the traffickers, and I really wanted them to go to jail. The whole process took years.  In Indonesia, the traffickers came looking for me at my mother's house, and she and my daughter had to go into hiding. Those men were looking for me for a long time. So great was the danger to my daughter that eventually the US government and Safe Horizon made it possible for her to join me in America. We were finally reunited in 2004.  In return for helping the government, I was granted permanent residency in 2010. At that point, they told me I could choose a new name, for my own safety. But I decided to stick with good old Shandra Woworuntu. It is, after all, my name. The traffickers took so much - why should I give them that too?  A couple of years after my escape, I began getting severe pain and numbness in my joints. I developed skin problems and found I was suffering from terrible migraines. After many tests, the doctors put it all down to the psychological toll of what I had been through.  It's been 15 years now, but I still have sleepless nights. My relationships with men are still far from normal. I still see a therapist every week, and I still go, once a fortnight, to a psychiatrist to pick up a prescription for anti-depressants. I still get flashbacks, all the time. The smell of whisky makes me retch and if I hear certain ringtones - the ones my traffickers had - my body stiffens with fear. Faces in a crowd terrify me - they jump out, familiar for an instant, and I go to pieces.  Spend any time with me and you will see me fiddling nervously with the ring on my finger to calm myself down. I used to wear an elastic band on my arm, that I would snap continuously, and a scarf that I would twist about.  So happiness eludes me, and perhaps it always will. But I have got better at dealing with my flashbacks. I love to sing in a choir, and I have found raising my children to be very healing. My little girl is a big girl now - a teenager! - and I have a nine-year-old son too.  I have decided to do everything I can to help other victims of trafficking. I started an organisation, Mentari, which helps survivors reintegrate into community, and connects them to the job market.  At the same time, we are trying to raise awareness of the risks of coming to the US among people who still see this country as some kind of dream land. Every year, 17,000 to 19,000 people are brought to the US to be trafficked. Last year, we helped publish an educational comic book on the issue in Indonesian. We also provide chickens and seed so that the poorest can raise the chickens to sell and eat, and don't feel they have to sell their children to traffickers.  Not all victims of trafficking are poor, though. Some, like me, have college degrees. I have helped a doctor and a teacher from the Philippines. I have also helped men who were trafficked, not only women, and one person who was 65 years old. I have spoken about my experiences at church halls, schools, universities and government institutions.  After I first started to tell my story, the Indonesian consulate approached me, not with an apology but a request for me to retract my statements about their refusal to help. Sorry, too late - it's out there. I can't pretend what you did didn't happen. Even after my case made the news, the Indonesian government didn't bother to get in touch to check if I was OK, or needed help.  As well as working with community groups, I have also addressed the Mexican government and last year I testified before the US Senate.  I asked the senators to introduce legislation to ensure that workers recruited overseas know their rights, are not charged fees, and are told the truth about the salary and living conditions they can expect in the US. I'm happy to say that since then the law has been changed and overseas recruitment agencies have to register with the Department of Labour before they can operate.  I was also lobbying the Senate, on behalf of the National Survivor Network, to place victims of human trafficking in roles where we can have a direct impact on policy.  The Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act has done exactly that. I'm honoured to say that in December 2015 I was asked to join a new advisory council, and we met for the first time in January, at the White House.  We urgently need to educate Americans about this subject. Looking back on my own experiences, I think all those casino and hotel workers must have known what was going on. And that brothel in Brooklyn was in a residential area - did the neighbours never stop to ask why an endless stream of men came to the house, night and day?  The problem is that people see trafficked women as prostitutes, and they see prostitutes not as victims, but criminals. And in cities, people turn a blind eye to all sorts of criminality. We might start by putting men who pay for sex in jail. After that brothel in Brooklyn was raided many sex buyers were interviewed, but all were later released.  Nowadays, men who are caught in the act are sent to a one-day session called John School. It's not really punishment, but it teaches them how to identify children in brothels, and women being coerced into sex work. Good - but not good enough. I think men who pay for sex with trafficked women or men should have their names put on a public list, just like they do for child abusers and sexual predators.  I am still close friends with Nina, who recently turned 30. And for years, I had a phone number for Eddy, the man who spoke to the FBI on my behalf, when I was desperate. In 2014, around Christmas, I dialled the number. I was going to tell him about everything that had happened to me, but he cut me off, saying, ""I know it all. I followed the news. I am so glad for you, that you have made a life for yourself.""  Then he said, ""Don't even think about saying thank you to me - you have done it all yourself.""  But I would like to thank you, Eddy, for listening to my story that day in the park, and helping me start my life again.  Written for BBC News.","There are an estimated 57,700 people in modern slavery in the US according to GSI estimates. The US attracts migrants and refugees who are particularly at risk of vulnerability to human trafficking. Trafficking victims often responding to fraudulent offers of employment in the US migrate willingly and are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in industries such as forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Shandra Woworuntu arrived in the US hoping to start a new career in the hotel industry. Instead, she found she had been trafficked into a world of prostitution and sexual slavery, forced drug-taking and violence. It was months before she was able to turn the tables on her persecutors."
Mark,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Netherlands (slavery location) Sweden (slavery location) United Kingdom (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"Back in 2009, towards the end of 2009 like I kind of fell on hard times you could say. Erm which led to me being picked up in the street by a gentleman who promised me work, a place to live, you know three meals a day sort of thing. Sounded excellent. Er so my plan was to go work for this gentleman, save some money, get myself back on my feet. Turned out not to be quite as it had been sold to me. Er ended up moving around the south of England a fair amount. Interviewer: You were being moved around basically were you? Mark: Yeah. Ferried from place to place. Working 18 hour days for, at first little pay and later no pay at all. Interviewer: I mean we often use this term slavery don’t we, and it’s a difficult term to use but at the worst moments when you were going through this is that how you felt? Did you feel like a slave? Mark: No question. It’s definitely a form of slavery. Interviewer: And you just felt you couldn’t get out, you couldn’t escape the situation? Mark: There was no way. After a, up to a, up to a certain point I was entirely dependent on my boss for the thing, for money, for food, accommodation, everything like that. There was no physical way I could leave. … Interviewer: Mark, who do you think could have, should have helped you? Or do you think there was any opportunity you could’ve asked for help? Mark: None at all. At the time I didn’t see it. I couldn’t see the police taking me seriously. Erm every time the police had visited us on worksites for example they’d treat the victims as the criminals. Erm so kind of, there was no way I was going to go to the police. Erm who else do you go to sort of thing, who’s going to believe you? Interviewer: And when you were in that situation were you physically restrained? Was there anything physically stopping you or is it you just being to think that you cannot get out, you can’t get out? Mark: it’s a form of mental imprisonment I would say. I was never physically restrained, I was never locked in. But you come to a point where you can not leave, where you either stay there and suffer this or you go back out into the world with nothing at all. It’s the lesser of two evils. … Interviewer: Mark, how are you doing now? Mark: I’m doing fine now, but kind of, of my own volition sort of thing. I think that the way that the authorities have handled, not just my case but every other case that I’ve come into contact with has been horrendous, absolutely horrendous. So, I’ve got there, kind of under my own steam. There’s definitely a lot of, a lot of work that needs to be done. As told to BBC News","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. According to the most recent Eurostat findings, European Union (EU) citizens account for 65 percent of identified trafficked victims within Europe. These individuals mostly originate from Eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia. Mark Ovenden is a survivor of modern slavery. In an interview with the BBC, he recounts how he was offered accommodation and employment just outside his hometown in Southern England. At the time – Sept. 2009 – he had no job and was eating out of soup kitchens, so he jumped at the chance to earn some money. But things did not turn out as Ovenden expected. Between Sept. 2009 and April 2010, he moved with the family to different areas in the U.K., Holland and Sweden where he was forced to work for either no money or minimal pay. The work – taking up and laying driveways – was physical, repetitive and generally involved labouring for long hours. Ovenden, who said he had no support network of friends or family at the time, soon became completely dependent on his bosses."
Mitos,2018 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Philippines (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"If I never argued with them, still I would be their slave. My job was to take care of them, take care of the house, take care of all their needs. They never allowed me to go outside. When I go outside, I have to be with them, and when they go outside they have to lock me inside the house. I don’t have any privacy. I sleep in the living room. No bathroom to take my shower. My things are all placed in the toilet. Every day, 24 hours on call. No day off. No freedom. They always verbally abused me calling me names, stupid, animal, garbage. I respected the family where I am working but they never showed me respsect. Even the food, sometimes they eat, and they scrap foods from their plates and not from the serving plate. I feel as if I’m flying up on air like before I was feeling like I was carrying a heavy heavy load on me. Now that I’m free I feel very very happy. Recovering from emotional and mental abuse is very difficult.  It doesn’t matter how many times I forget, it always pops up in my mind. Although how much I miss my family, although how much I miss my daughter, going back is not my priority now, because as the breadwinner of the family I have to work. My advice to anybody working as a housemaid, being abused, just continue to be brave. Think of your family. Don’t do anything bad and wait for the time you are ready to fight for your rights.  ","The United Kingdom remains a significant destination and, to a lesser extent, transit country for women, men and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation.

Ope,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Spain (slavery location),United Kingdom (slavery location),"My early memories of Nigeria, I had a nice childhood growing up. My parents are not very wealthy but at least they managed to send me to primary school. In 2005 I met this guy who takes people abroad to work. He said I would be working in a factory or as a nanny and I would be earning good money. They never tell you that you are coming to work as a prostitute. We stayed in a boat for 4 days and 4 nights. The water kept splashing inside and we had to bail it out. It was really cold. We had little food and water, I was lucky to be alive. Then on the 5th day, we got to Tenerife island in Spain. Police and the ambulance came then they flew us to the mainland, to Madrid. My trafficker was waiting outside the airport. He took me to his flat. That’s when I found out the other girls are working on the streets as prostitutes. I’d never done such a thing in my life. I was worried and scared I found out later there is a specific amount of money they make you bring home every day. If you go home empty handed, you get beaten up really badly. I left Nigeria to get a better life, and the situation I was in at the time, it was even worse than the life I was living in Nigeria. If I’d just stayed at home, none of this would’ve happened. On the day I was raped, this man stopped next to me in a van. The direction he was driving to was l lonely and dark, so I told him to let me out. The next thing, he brings out a pistol. I’d never seen a pistol before. So, I didn’t argue with him, I just sat still. He beat me up and raped me. And after that they decided to traffic me again, to England. We landed in Stanstead airport and spent a day in London before they moved me to Coventry. It was a normal house, just a normal house in a normal street they said I would be working as a prostitute but not for long because it takes time to get a good job. I said it’s the same trick as those people in Spain used. The first year it was just work, sleep, eat. Even if you are sick they don’t care, they still bring the men in. four, five a day. I could not leave. It was like I was a slave to them. After a while they let me out to buy things, because they didn’t think I would run away. One day I went to the market, I saw this wallet on the floor. I was thinking maybe there is some money inside, at least I have some money. When I opened it there was this ID card. It was a Belgium ID card. That night I had a small suitcase and put some clothes in it. I went to their bedroom and took some money, one hundred or something. I wanted to leave, to get to France. So, I took a bus to the town centre to the national express. And they sold me a one-way ticket to London. I went to Kings Cross to board the train. Then the immigration officer, he looked at me and said, what other ID do I have? I said ‘I don’t have anything. I don’t have anything’. I spent the night in a police cell, then they sent me direct to HMP Holloway. I was thinking I should’ve stayed back, I shouldn’t have run away. If there was a way I could go back to my traffickers, I would have gone back instead of me being in this place, in prison. It was like a dream, you know? I never believed the judge would have set me free. Now I would like to go to Uni, and hopefully one day get married. It’s been a year since I ran away from them. My life is getting better than the way it used to be. Courtesy of BBC News","There are an estimated 11,700 people living in modern slavery in the United Kingdom.

Cristina,"",Sexual exploitation Children,Romania (slavery location) Romania (trafficked from) Children,United Kingdom (slavery location),"When I was 16, my mum forced me to sleep with men to pay for our flat in Romania. One client, Sorin, suggested babysitting work in the UK. Mum wanted us to go but I didn’t trust him when he provided a false ID. Sorin drove us from the airport to a house in Birmingham. There, a man and woman controlled three girls who worked for them in their spa salon doing massage. I was bought vulgar clothes, taught bad English words. They called me Roxie. It wasn’t massage we did in the spa, but other things. I was forced to provide sexual services for more than a year. One day the police saw me with my make-up on getting out of a car. They asked questions. I didn’t understand English. They took me to a police station. I spent the night in a cell. I told them everything through an interpreter. I testified against the traffickers.

Erm so he’d invite you for a drink inside the house. He’s put his hand on your knee, and it was uncomfortable but it was, yeah it sort of progressed from there. I realised it was wrong when he started to say you now need to, I’ve done this for you, what are you going to do for me? I said I didn’t want to and he said oh it’ll only take a couple of seconds and I was special to him and if he was special to me and if I appreciated what he did, I would have sex. I think from the first time that’s when he felt like he owned you or he’s made his mark on you. I didn’t tell them because Keith had always said it was a secret. I didn’t tell them because I was ashamed. Because the background I come from, sex before marriage or sex itself is quite a hidden subject and shameful to speak about. There'd be 2 or 3 and then Keith would say, erm you need to do me a favour erm, he owed them something and that I needed to do it. They’d offer you weed, they’d offer you drugs, they’d offer you alcohol, and they were a lot more forceful and violent. And they’d pass you around. The men would then bring their friends in and the network got bigger. I was hooked on diazepam, erm so I kept going back. You can try and run away, but trafficking almost steals your identity. So you become what they need you to become and that’s all that you feel worth. So you go back because that’s the only thing that’s giving you purpose.

It was only when one of her employer’s children’s teachers called the police that this survivor was able to escape."
Bukola,2016 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",United States (slavery location),"My trafficker was my husband. There was no way I could reach out to anybody for help. My trafficker, he promised marriage, and we had actually taken the step by doing a traditional marriage. After I became pregnant, his attitude just changed. When we’d go to church on a Sunday, I would tell women I see that I could braid hair, and they would come to the house to have their hair braided, so he found out that I was good at it. Then, he decided to exploit me by taking the money. I was there without enough food. I couldn’t go out at will. I was confined in the house just braiding hair, and sometimes for up to 14 hours. A public health nurse always come to the house to visit, and I got connected with that through the WIC program. I didn’t have the courage to say anything to her. But when it was time for me to make the jump, I had to call her, and she said, ""The first step is to go to the shelter."" And I stayed there for 8 months with my son. I was referred to a support group for immigrant women and refugees. That support group really helped me because I saw many other women in my shoes sharing their story. And some of them have gotten help, and that was really uplifting and encouraging for me. It’s important to completely give survivors their power back by helping them. If they want to go to school, to go to school. If they want to start a trade or do their own business, to be able to start something on their own.  As a journalist, I am just one the few people who not only can write but can actually put their experiences together in a book, because writing the book was both therapeutic and challenging. I’m glad to have a second chance, and that is why I have dedicated my life to these efforts to help other victims. If you have not walked in their shoes, you have no idea what they are going through.   Courtesy of the Office for Victims of Crime"," There are an estimated 57,700 people in modern slavery in the US according to GSI estimates.

If we’re recognizing signs, we’re able to do something about it. My trafficking was for almost 8 years. He was a close friend of the family. The words were used: ""If you tell, I’ll cut you. I’ll bust you in your head. I’ll bust you in your nose."" Being a male and being sex trafficked, when you go to a person and say, ""Hey, so-and-so is doing this to me,""—""Oh, we don’t believe you. Stop lying."" We’re the victims. We need people to believe who the victims really are. Being a male survivor, that’s what’s needed: support. Being able to understand that it happens to everybody, you know, not just the male or the female, but to everybody. If others can see that there are male survivors, and that’s it’s okay to tell, then maybe we can get additional help out and get the word out that we’re here to help.   Courtesy of the Office for Victims of Crime"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States.

Niko,2016 (Narrative date),Trafficking,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"It just...it was awful, the whole experience. Trafficking, it doesn’t know any boundaries. And it happens all over America. So I came from kind of a more privileged background, but I still...it still happened to me—and a male. The victim can be male, female, transgendered, anyone. You’re initially brainwashed. And then, over a period of time, you become conditioned where you start to accept that this is all you can do. I was kicked out of my parents’ home because of my sexual orientation, and, in a lot of ways, it really conditioned me for being very vulnerable To describe the relationship between the trafficker and a victim is a domestic violence situation. There’s this connection to the abuser. The biggest thing that I went through was therapy and acceptance. Acceptance that the abuse that I went through, I didn’t deserve; that I didn’t bring that on myself. I relocated out to Los Angeles for graduate school in psychology. I wanted to work with, not just the victim, but the whole victim support network—family members, friends, whoever is in their support network.   Courtesy of the Office for Victims of Crime  "," There are an estimated 57,700 people in modern slavery in the US according to GSI estimates. Research indicates that runaway and homeless youth populations face notable vulnerabilities to human trafficking. Covenant House, one of the U.S.’ largest privately-funded childcare agencies aiding runways and homeless children, has been conducting research on the prevalence of human trafficking and survival sex as well as labour trafficking among homeless and runaway youth in New York City, New York, and New Orleans, Louisiana. The research supported the findings that vulnerabilities such as housing insecurity were critical motivating factors in prompting minors to engage in survival sex. Niko was forced to leave his parent’s home after they refused to accept his sexual orientation. As a result, he became vulnerable to exploitation. In this narrative Niko talks about how anyone can be vulnerable to trafficking and how he worked to dispel the feeling of self-guilt surrounding his abuse. "

I wasn’t getting paid. I was lied to. I was abused. I didn’t know I was a victim of human trafficking until I told my story. I was born in Ecuador.

I never end up going to school. I was home 24 hours with the baby, and then, little by little, she started telling me to cook, to clean. I wasn’t getting paid. I was monitored, everything that I did. I felt trapped without, like, no exit. They made me feel that they were doing something great by giving me food and giving me a place to live, and the way that I had to pay them back is doing everything for them. I was a victim of human trafficking. I’m happy that I got good guidance. I work in a bank. I’m currently the operation supervisor branch manager. I created a very simple program all about banking. I was able to help these people that didn’t know the basics of banking. They felt that I helped them a lot, and that was a good experience for me. I came out from the darkness.

Amy,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United States (slavery location),"I still see this attitude of, ""It’s just immigrants,"" or, ""It’s just people in other countries."" It happens to U.S. citizens so much more than people are aware. We need to understand that freedom of movement does not equal freedom of choice. Most of the time, being trapped is something we can’t see. It’s something that the trafficker pinpoints as a vulnerability and is able to use against the victim. The world of a trafficking victim is constant fear, constant dehumanization, just feeling like you are not even a person anymore. I experienced sex trafficking. I was a single mom trying to finish college, and that was what eventually led me to an adult club. It wasn’t something I was comfortable with, but, feeling pretty desperate, I thought, ""Let me just try it, see what happens."" The second night was when I met my trafficker. He was giving me what I thought was a legitimate job offer. You know, he said, ""Let’s go over to my business."" But once I got in there, I was held against my will, and that was the process of beatings and rapes by multiple subjects, and held in there for over 12 hours. And because that process was methodical and designed to break me down, I was very much like a robot. I was going to do what he told me to do. It wasn’t so much that nobody noticed; it was they didn’t know what to look for or what to call it. Sex trafficking is the action of a perpetrator recruiting, transporting, maintaining, harboring through force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of exploitation. I came in contact with a lot of law enforcement officials, and they just weren’t trained. Some of them were well-intentioned. What you’re really going to want to look at is other signs that indicate exploitation. I saw this in shelters; medical doctors as well ER—physicians. That’s why training is so important. Having the resources available, allowing the victim to choose but giving her support to do so, is important Having a long‐term support system of people who have been there, now, for years, has been why I’ve been able to do as well as I’ve done. It’s that long term that’s important. I never thought that what I went through would be useful. The courts have found, when they have taken any cases... Now I’m in my last year of law school and enjoying being a mom and helping train law enforcement and using negative experiences that I’ve been through to put it to something useful.   Courtesy of the Office for Victims of Crime"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States.

They offer us job in United States working in hotels. When we came here, what happened is, there was not such a job like that. They got us a job in DVD manufacturing company. We already invest a lot of money to come, so we had to accept the job, and we did. But he treated us like we were no one. We were living in a one-bedroom apartment, and it was three people living there. My pay check every week was, like, $39. When we were in that situation, people could see us. We were hard-working in that company. Nobody noticed anything. And then we met Catholic Charity person, and we explained her our situation, so she contacted one agent from ICE. Services are so necessary, especially when you’re trying to come out of that situation, because you don’t have anything. Those services, in my case, helped me a lot. They made it all possible to bring my wife and my two kids. I got a job, thanks to the people that were out there to help me. But they changed our lives. I mean, they save us. And I can tell you now because I’m a survivor of human trafficking, yeah. I experienced labor trafficking. We were really scared. We were uncertain what’s going to happen. The first day that we arrived in Biloxi, we didn’t have money to buy food. And then we met social worker. An agent from ICE start interviewing us, asking questions about the case and all those things that we went through. But our case was already open in Kansas, and they start helping us. Because we provide enough information of what they did to us, they went to jail for years and years.

A young lady moved in with me to babysit my kids. Her brother was in a gang. I got jumped into the gang by being raped by all of them, and so then I was forced out onto the streets from 8 o’clock at night till 5 in the morning, 7 days a week. I felt like there was no way I could get out. I had to have engagements with 15 people a night before I could come home. I got into the West Women’s Shelter in northwest Portland. They worked with me. I had a psychiatrist. I had a caseworker. I had a counsellor. And I got sent to this organization. It was run by survivors who were also the counsellors.

Suamhirs,2016 (Narrative date),Children,Honduras (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Human trafficking is a crime that takes away souls, that takes away memories. My trafficker was someone who knew my family. I was given specific instructions: ""You’re going to do what I ask you to do. If you not, your mom and your three brothers in Honduras are going to die."" So I allowed one crime to happen so another crime wouldn’t. A neighbour reported that so many people were coming in and out of the house. Then, that’s how I was rescued. Most people didn’t understand what was I going through. Once I found the power of my story, I decided to become an advocate. I have shared my story as a way for people to be inspired to make change, as a way for people to become advocates, just like my CASA for me. Marcos, my court-appointed special advocate—he came into my life 2 days before my 18th birthday. He spoke Spanish. He really came into my life and really helped me. If it wasn’t for his help and support, I wouldn’t be the advocate I am today. As victims or survivors, we have been through a great deal of trauma in our lives. My trafficker was my godmother. Going through the whole court process was not easy. One, it’s because I have to be in front of my godmother once again, and, two, because someone was trying to defend her. She was taken to jail, so she has two life—two consecutive life sentences. I needed someone to help me and guide me and be my advocate in court and help me navigate through the process. Being a survivor is a continuous thing. We need to provide them with tools, coping skills to continue working on themselves. We really need to help people, in that transition time, find themselves, and that’s when people come into their lives and say, ""Well, can I help you? Can I walk the walk with you and help you find out who you are again? What do you want to do in life? What do you want to be in life, now that you’re free, that you own your body?"" We need to focus on the person first, because once they have a reason to be survivors, that’s when they love themselves again.

Jin,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Forced labour,Forced labour,United States (slavery location),"I typically don't get off work at the massage parlor until 11pm. Many times I am just starving. I didn't know what to eat and sometimes the other worker leaves me some food like grapes or an egg. I didn't have money to buy any food so I collected bottles of recyclables to sell. I can make $10 per bag but my boss didn't want me to put the big trash bags near the parlor, so he yelled at me. I found this parlor through the job board at the local Chinese grocery store. It said they would train me so I applied. But when I showed up, they just took my ID and told me to go work. Sometimes, the customers tried to assault me sexually. The first customer I ever worked with – I served him for an hour. I just did massage. Usually the customer is just face-down. But suddenly after an hour, I told the customer – 1 hour finished, only 15 minutes more – and he turned around and asked me to give him a “happy ending”. I told him “no, only massage”. The customer got upset and said no more, and I didn’t get any tip for that work. That was the first time. There once was a customer waiting over 40 minutes. I got into that massage room and worked there for 10 minutes. The customer turned face up again. I said “no, face down, don’t look at me”. The customer said “no” and then asked me to do some really inappropriate things. The customer started to touch me, I didn’t know what to do, so I continued to serve him. I only did 20 minutes and didn’t get paid. I wanted to quit, but the boss doesn’t allow me. The boss said, “you need to find a new person to come and then you can leave”. Boss didn’t ever want to pay me.

Christina B.,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),"My name is Christina and this is my freedom story. So I grew up here in Fresno and I was raised by a single mum. I’m the oldest of 5 kids, my dad left when I was a baby. I remember those feelings of needing to be wanted, of just wanting to be desirable. Those feelings grew even more and I started this pattern of promiscuous behaviour and I believed that all guys wanted was sex and if I just gave them sex then they would want me and that wasn’t what happened at all. So as a teen I had a rocky relationship with my mum, we fought all the time and I had a friend when I was 15 she had ran away from home and she invited me to come along with her. We ended up going to stay in Clovis and we were staying with these women who called themselves strippers, and they wanted me to erm, to do it with them. And I was flattered that they thought I was pretty enough to, to strip. And it seemed glamourous, they had you know the pretty clothes, the shoes and so it seemed like something that I wanted to do. It turned out that what happened behind closed door it wasn’t stripping at all it was child prostitution, but I didn’t realise that until I was an adult. And I remember calling out to God and I said God please keep me alive and I’ll go home. And so the next day when I got up, I asked for bus money because they had taken the money that I’d made and somebody gave me bus money and I left. And erm I didn’t realise at the time how lucky I was to just walk out like that. And for years I didn’t, I didn’t tell anybody what happened, I was so ashamed and just embarrassed. When I was 18 I ended up getting pregnant and you know I was scared about my future, I didn’t know how I was gonna take care of a baby, I didn’t know where I was going to live, I was bouncing around. And so I knew that if my life was going to get any better I needed God. And that’s when I started going to church and god started to change my life. And I ended up going back to high school, I got my high school diploma. It took me 8 years but I finished. God gave me a really good friend who encouraged me to go to college and I remember being terrified thinking there’s no way I could so college and. But sure enough I ended up going to college and I graduated city and then I went to erm Fresno Pacific got my BA in Liberal Arts and graduated with highest honours and I’m continuing my education with FU. I also teach kindergarten so my life is so blessed and I just, now I have this passion to serve others and I don’t have to be ashamed of my past anymore. I have compassion for the little girl that I was and what I went through and I love my story, I love my past because it’s made me who I am today and I’m a passionate woman who loves others, who wants to help people see God and I can be proud of that. As told to the Central Valley Justice Coalition"," Young people who run away from home are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation by traffickers: The Department of Justice estimates that 293,000 youth are at risk.

Erm I was just playing the school, er in my yard, I had missed school because my toe, I’d got injured. And this white van just pulled up and this white woman, American woman, asked me is your cousin Peila there? And I said no she had left to go to one of her friends’ house and I knew where she was so I offered to take her there and when we returned back home my mom and all my little sisters were leaning on the fence. And she looked through the window and asked my mom, ‘can I have one of your girls? You have such beautiful kids’ and erm she’s like ‘which one can I take?’ And I left with a little plastic bag that day with her and didn’t return. The first week wasn’t that good because that’s when I got my first beating with a piece of board off the beach because her daughter didn’t want me in the house. She got papers, my mom to sign papers and told her she’s going to do the adoption in America and she packed up the school bus, packed us up in the school bus and we drove from Placencia all the way  through Mexico and into Texas and during that time the bus kept breaking down and breaking down. Because it was an old school bus it was a school bus that she went from America to Belize in. We moved actually right across from Buchanan, I mean smack in front, we walked to school. And erm that’s where I attended tenth through twelfth grade was Buchanan high school. I, after that I truly knew I was free and it’s a feeling that I can never explain because for so many wars I tried and tried and nobody could help me. Everybody said either sorry or call this number or I don’t know what we can do and here’s this one woman I just explained a little bit of my story and she was at my front door, she was at that front door. Well preventing human trafficking is getting educated because there are many parts of human trafficking, there’s the sex part, and there’s the labour part. And with the labour part, you don’t necessarily see the victims, they’re behind closed doors. I was walking with behind people’s shadows and they didn’t even know I was a victim. I didn’t even know I was a victim. So it’s really, very important to get educated so even when the victim is not seeing the signs, you do, so you can help rescue them before its too late. As told to the Central Valley Justice Coalition"," Child victims of trafficking can be lured into the United States through the promise of education or work and the opportunity to send money back to their families. Children are vulnerable to kidnappers, pimps and professional brokers, with some even being sold by their families who may or may not have an understanding of what will happen to their child. US children are also trafficked within the US with cases of human trafficking reported in all 50 US states. It is estimated that 10 000 forced labourers in the US are trapped in domestic servitude.

She and the other children were moved around constantly by her trafficker and when not in school were forced to work for her trafficker’s business without pay.

Arien,"",Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Arien Pauls and this is my freedom story. This guy that I met online, actually before Facebook was really popular it was a site called Myspace, erm and he got on there and he would see the things that I was posting about what I was going through with my family. See me saying things about feeling alone or feeling like no one was there for me, and he used that as a way to get close to me, by saying how much he cared about me and how he would be somebody that would take care of me. He did use aspects of glamour as to taking me shopping, getting my nails done, showing me things. Once I started not feeling, I was starting to feel unsafe and I was starting to feel scared and I started to feel like wait a minute, why am I getting in trouble with the police? Why are these guys taking advantage of me? Why can’t I go to the hospital after I’ve been raped? All these different things started happening. When I started meeting him with some resistance, that’s when the abuse started. I was taken through what they call, its more sort of a network. There are certain cities and certain states that have been established as places where it’s lucrative for guys to take young girls. So I was taken all through Southern California, I was taken through Nevada, Oregon, through Washington, even across to Washington DC. And it came to one night where I kind of snapped, so I told him no, and I stood firm on that no. he got very upset, he actually beat me until he passed out. I was ready to die, and so when he fell asleep I wasn’t afraid of anything, I just packed my stuff and ran. And I didn’t know it at the time but my relationship started with Jesus on the night I escaped. I was in the middle of being beaten and all of a sudden I couldn’t feel anything and it wasn’t a feeling of I’m gonna die, it was a feeling of, I can’t feel these punches. Every time he hit me his hands felt like pillows on my back, like I literally couldn’t feel any physical pain.  Now that I do have a relationship with Jesus and with God, I look back and I know that that was the first time I felt God just reach down and put his arms around me. Erm from that moment it took me almost 2 years to er get where I am. When I went into church on the rock it was a very, it was kind of like, God’s home for broken and misfit people. I could just feel that there were a lot of broken people there. And they were very open and raw about the fact that this is where you come to heal, this is your family, when you come in here broken you shouldn’t walk out broken. Church is so much more than just a tie or an offering or a worship song and so I was able to grow and I was really, I was really surprised. But then again can’t be really that surprised when it’s God working. As told to the Central Valley Justice Coalition"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Arien was feeling alone when she met a man who made her feel like he was there for her. After building up her trust this man began to abuse Arien and forced her into commercial sexual exploitation. Taken across the United States by her trafficker and subjected daily to physical and sexual abuse, Arien was finally able to escape one night while her trafficker was sleeping."
Beth,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,Children,United States,"I was trafficked at sixteen. When I turned eighteen, it was NOT a magic number. No one mailed me a bunch of information about choices I had now that I was of age. If you asked me if I liked it at sixteen, I would have said yes, in fear of my life being snubbed out by my pimp or his counterparts. I didn’t enter that world willingly. I was told I was going to a party by a man who said I was beautiful and wanted to be my boyfriend. When I did arrive to a new state, I did not know a soul. I was beaten all the way there. When we were riding, he gave me a drink and I woke up in the dark at a truck stop. I will never forget his words to me. He said, “Baby, do you know what I am?” I said, “No.”  He said, “I’m a pimp, and we don’t have enough gas to get to the party. I have this guy in the truck right here and you need to ‘trick him’. Just get in his truck and make him happy.” I laughed at him and said, “No way, you are tripping. I don’t do that.” He pulled out a gun and said, “I didn’t ask you, bitch. Get your ass in that truck. I don’t have time for this shit.” He jumped out pulled me out of the car and told me if I screwed this up, he was going to kill me. I got in the truck. That is the night my life changed forever. I could go on and speak of the horrors of that night, but I won’t. I share this with you because I need you to understand how this happens and what it feels like to be stripped of anything that resembles your ‘other life’. I learned to comply quickly. I tried to have the police help me, and they did, or so I thought until they had me on a bus to go back to my home state. You see, I got off the bus to use the bathroom and the pimp was there. He dragged me back to his car and beat me so bad I almost died. Now, in my worldview, the police are part of this whole ‘new life’. I surrendered and did as I was told.  Part of getting me ready to deal with people out there, my pimp groomed me to believe if I ever told anyone including the police that I was a minor, they would lock me up and never let me go. They would keep me until I turned eighteen. I didn’t want to go back to the abuse I left. I didn’t want to get locked up forever. My pimp told me to say I was twenty-one and he would come and get me. He said that is why he had to take anything that identified me as me. If I had my belongings they would know I was a minor and I would be trapped. He instilled fear in me to acknowledge my identity to anyone. I grew up so sheltered. I knew nothing about jail, welfare or how our world worked. I did remember how the police and social services came to my school and took one of my friends and I never saw her again. At that time, I thought it was just the police, so I believed him. I lived in constant fear that someone would find out my real age. I rehearsed my new name, birthdate, and address over and over again.  I need you to understand that victims don’t tell you the truth about their age. This is exactly how we miss these young people. Unfortunately, after they turn eighteen in their real identity, our society feels like they are no longer eligible for help – they no longer have been hurt. All of a sudden, people assume they have made a career choice and their situation changes from child trafficking victim to ‘prostitute’. We all know prostitutes choose to do this, right? I cannot wrap my head around this thinking. I assure you, I didn’t get a birthday party when I turned eighteen. In fact, I got a broken finger because I felt bad that my pimp didn’t recognize my special day. I was an adult now. I got no card, no present, no cake, no gift, no day off. It was a regular day with a higher quota than usual because he had an attitude due to me thinking I would be treated different on this day. He beat me and broke my finger, and sent me to ‘work’ broken finger and all. There was no mail from the ‘options academy’ listing all of the choices I had now that I was of age. The police didn’t pull me over and say, “Hey Julie, you know you have options now. You don’t have to do this anymore; no one can lock you up for not being the right age anymore.” It is interesting to me how people think eighteen is this magic number that just changes your whole life. Maybe in the outside world it does, but in the culture of prostitution/sex trafficking, eighteen is just another number. When I turned eighteen, I was already twenty-three anyway according to the police.  So as we count victims and as we decide who is entitled to receive help, please don’t forget what I shared with you. Many of those eighteen, nineteen, twenty and twenty-one year old ‘prostitutes’ are really fourteen, fifteen and sixteen. They have just been groomed and beaten into compliance to say they are eighteen. I know this is still happening today. Rachel Lloyd of GEMS goes into correctional facilities to do groups. She stated how surprised she was that there were so many juveniles in the adult jail.  Eighteen is NOT a magic number.   Originally published on Ruth Jacobs, Soul Destruction "," Sex trafficking exists throughout the United States and across the world. Traffickers use violence, threats, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. According the US Federal Law, any person under the age of 18 years old persuaded into commercial sex is a victim of sex trafficking – no matter if the trafficker uses force, fraud and coercion or not. In many cases of sex trafficking, victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces or manipulates them into prostitution. Young people who run away from home are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation by traffickers: the Department of Justice estimates that 293,000 youth are at risk. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) estimates that “1 in 5 of the 11,800 runways reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2015 were likely sex trafficking victims.” In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Beth was just 16 when she met a man who said he wanted to be her boyfriend. He invited her to a party in a different state, however on the way there Beth was beaten and drugged. On awaking Beth was threatened with a gun, had her identifying documents taken from her and forced to perform commercial sex work."
Blu,2013 (Narrative date),"",Sexual exploitation,Children,"I spent three years working as a prostitute, from the age of 13 ‘til I left school at 16. Not that I wanted to work – I’d gotten involved with a guy in his late teens who lived near my school, and it all went from there. People seem to be under the impression that we ‘choose’ to work as prostitutes. It’s an argument that falls with its first assumption, because, hey, define ‘choice’. Selling your body being the last option you have to survive, or because it’s all you’ve been brought up to know, isn’t in any way ‘choice’ at all, especially not when you add on extra pressures like a family to feed. Yet it’s exactly these reasons why the vast majority of women work in prostitution. An aside – I’m going to talk about women here, because I am primarily identified as one, and because I don’t know enough about male experiences of prostitution to ever claim that I could speak for them too. I knew a few guys who worked also, and it seemed as though we shared some experiences but maybe not others. I don’t think male survivors of prostitution get anywhere near the help and support they need (if indeed they get any at all). This needs to change. In a society where men are taught to view sex as always desirable, I should imagine it’s even more difficult for male survivor of prostitution to speak out. Anyway, back to choice. I didn’t choose prostitution, and I don’t think my case is an isolated one either. I’d seen this guy a few times. We flirted. As a kid that had already been sexually abused for years and who was very unpopular, withdrawn and unhappy in school, attention from an attractive older teenage boy felt great. Our relationship quickly became sexual, which I had no problem with. And then he brought along a friend. No, I didn’t want to have sex with his friend too, certainly not with him watching. I felt he was taking advantage of me. So I did what any female would do in that situation, and said no. He then punched me in the face. I think it was shock more than anything. I was used to being creeped around and manipulated into sex, but out-and-out violence was an utter shock, as was the fact that both of them laughed about it and didn’t seem to see any problem with what they were doing. My so-called boyfriend then grabbed me, and, well, held me down and raped me in front of his friend. Then invited his friend to do the same. And so it went on from there. He lived very close to my school, so he always knew where to find me. He’d wait for me at break times, or after school. After it being one of his friends it was then two – with “come on, you were okay the last time” as an excuse. There was never any choice, it just built up, layer upon layer of abuse until very quickly he was collecting me from school and taking me to flats, every school day, where groups of men would be waiting – having already agreed with him what they’d do. Some would have sex with me, some had paid just to watch, but it was always done in a group setting.  The sex bothered me less than the violence and humiliation. A group of guys together very quickly turned terrifying, and there were often men there whom I knew had wives and kids and who were ostensibly the ‘quiet’ type who’d never do anything ‘like that’…until they got in a group of their friends and everyone else was doing it too. I won’t detail things, because I’m also aware that there are sick f*cks out there in the world who’d get off on even that, but I was regularly slapped, beaten, kicked, spat on, mocked, laughed at, and of course raped. I didn’t want any of the sex, but they always told me that I did. They’d goad each other into doing more and more things, some sexual, some violent – it became like some sort of competition for them to see how far they could go. The shame kills me now, still, more than the bleeding, torn skin, burns and broken bones ever did. The shame and self-hate is the real poison. Of course, you’re told it’s all your fault, that there’s just something about you that makes them act that way, or that you like it really. It’s always your fault. Everyone knew about it, too. My pimp (no way I was calling him my boyfriend by this time) seemed to really enjoy making sure the kids in my school knew what was going on. He’d use as many methods as possible to humiliate and frighten me, and making sure everyone knew what a slag I was, was a brilliant way of doing that – it ensured I got bullied, so had no friends on my side. He was obvious in collecting me from school. He invited boys from the years above me in school to watch his ‘sessions’. He’d wipe cum on my clothes then take me back to school in them. One weekend (I only worked on schoolnights) I bumped into him in town when I was with my mother, and he walked right up to her and smiled in her face. Of course, she wanted to know who he was and I had absolutely no way of telling her… I got no money. So no, it wasn’t magically all better because I was paid for it. Yes, adults in positions of authority knew – including my mother. But the questions they asked were all framed in disbelief – “this apparent involvement in prostitution” and the like – and their only reasoning was to get me to stop skipping school. To them, I was being an annoying teenager deliberately causing trouble. I was more frightened of my pimp and what he could do to me than I was of their threats of vague legal action, so I said nothing when they asked about me working. I had no choice anyway. If I was in school, my pimp would find me. I didn’t want to piss off the powers that be, of course, but it wasn’t like I had an option. I didn’t use drugs as I had no access to them, but I used to sniff glue and butane gas when I could. My biggest fear, apart from being killed, was getting pregnant – as I was under 16, I wasn’t allowed to be prescribed the pill, despite me sneaking into the local clinic to ask for it. I didn’t know where to get condoms from (I had no idea they would ever be given away free and no-one at the clinic mentioned it), so condom use was entirely dependent on my pimp and punters. I got into the routine of washing myself out with a mix of hot water and disinfectant, as it was the only way I could think of to prevent infection and pregnancy. Despite a few scares, I never got pregnant but I did have endless infections, thrush, and by the time I was 19 I’d developed cervical cancer. I left prostitution when I left school – I moved away. It was the only way out that I could think of. I had to go back to the city where I grew up around seven years later and actually saw my ex-pimp walking down the street not long after. He recognised me. I hid in a shop, and it took all my strength not to throw up in fear. Thankfully he was gone when I finally emerged. I’d like to say that I’m over it, but I’m not. Even now, I’m scared of people – men in particular, especially groups of men. I tried to get over this for years, thinking I was being big and brave by going to pubs and football games alone, but I’d recognise faces from the crowd…regulars. And despite the fact that they didn’t recognise me, it guts me even now that they’re happily walking around as if they’re perfectly normal, and I’m constantly terrified. I moved away again five years ago and although I feel a little safer where I live now, there is still the absolute nauseous panic when guys start with the sexist jokes, or look at a woman in a certain way, or worse still, joke about how cool it is to go to strip clubs or pay for sex. It’s also amazing how many people will use your history as a reason to discount your opinions: “well, that’s just *your* experience”, or “you’re just overemotional because you were abused – no-one *normal* has a problem with these things”. The current so-called liberal trend to decriminalising prostitution is an open invitation for the abuse of women. Sorry, but the entire basis of prostitution rests on inequality, and decriminalising the demand says such inequality is fine – sexualised, even. Time after time academic research shows that the vast majority of women in prostitution want to leave, yet the tiny minority who are lucky enough to have the ‘choice’ to work and have their boundaries and wishes respected are given far more publicity – after all, it pleases the male majority to hear this, and there’s nothing quite like male approval, is there? (I’m being sarcastic). I’m told over and over that ‘some women like it’ and that means it should be legal and fine for men to demand sex via pay. I’ve been lectured by women working by choice on how illiberal I am for wanting to see demand for prostitution criminalised. Evidently these women either don’t, or don’t want to, see their privilege – most women in prostitution do NOT have free choice, they don’t have their wishes respected, and no is frequently ignored. How could it not be? The whole point of prostitution is that a man pays for someone who won’t say no, who will do whatever it is that he wants. The woman’s boundaries are seen as non-existent or negotiable. Your ‘no’ will be ignored. Why should the demand for that be in any way decriminalised?   Originally published on Ruth Jacobs, Soul Destruction "," On any given day in 2016 there were an estimated 40.3 million people in modern slavery across the world, with women and girls accounting for 71% of victims. People looking for work and a better standard of living are often deceived, forced and coerced in to such forms of modern slavery as forced labour, debt bondage, domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Women and girls made up more than 99% of victims of forced sexual exploitation. Moreover more than 1 million of these victims (21%) were children under the age of 18. Child victims are often difficult to detect by both law enforcement and child protection agents, as such the true figure of children in commercial sexual exploitation is likely to be much higher than the current estimate. Blu was 13 years old when she began seeing an older boy that lived near her school. This boy began forcing Blu to have sex with other men, subjecting her to physical violence when she refused. Though other people in her life – including her mother – knew about her prostitution, no one believed that she was being forced. It was only when she left school at 16 and moved away that she could escape."
Elanie,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,South Africa (trafficked from) Children,South Africa (slavery location),"From a very very young age I had to learn how to survive each day, with or without an adult to guide me. I never knew God when I was very little, and if I did I know I would have coped more with a lot of things. For many many years I blamed God for what I had to go through as a young women, I kept asking Him the same questions: “WHY”, why did I had to go through so much in order to still battle as a young women, a mother and wife. For many years He did answer me, I just never listened. It was a journey to come to where I am today, a journey with lots and lots of tears and sadness, but through all this, He was always with me and still is till the end. I was broken, He put me back together again, I was shattered , He picked up the pieces, I was unable to trust and to love, His love restored me, I am not saying my life is perfect now, I am saying that He is in control of my life, no matter what, and because of Him, I can lay down my head on His shoulders for comfort. He moulded me to be who I am today, I never understood why certain things happens in life, but at the end of the day I know now, He does have a plan.  We were very very poor, very, I was still a little girl, around 4, 5 years old that I remember my brother, sister and I had to steal food for a living. They had to climb through fences late at night to go into vegetable gardens to steal our supper. Alcohol was the ruler in our house, it controlled my parents every day. My father was a way a lot of times, and that left my mom at home alone a lot, from being alone, she had boyfriends entertaining her most of the times. As I am the youngest, I was staying at home while my siblings will go to school, when my mom was drunk and one of her boyfriends came to visit, she would tie me up a big tree and tell me to shut up. I would be standing by the tree tied up for hours, while the boyfriend or friend was entertaining her. When my mother was drunk she use to get very aggressive, my sister use to hide me in the closets for hours, she would bring bread and water, she was my mother, my sister was the one looking after me. I never understood why this was happening. There were days that we would go to sleep without food, but alcohol was the ruler. I guess in my brothers heart, he was battling with his own demons and pain, as little as 6 years old I was given alcohol to shut my mouth, the only way my brother could get rid of his pain, was by abusing me, sexually. My days was complete with alcohol, pain killers and molestation. My sister never knew about my brother abusing me. Whenever she could she would have hid me in the closet. I was sexually molested until the age of 14, I was even molested by one of my brother’s teachers, he stayed at a farm, and that was our escape from home time to time. My parents got divorced when I was 14 years old, my mom took off with another man, during the times she had many affairs, which I was mostly involved. Many nights her boyfriend will pick her and myself up while my dad was passed out at home and he would take us to a hotel, many nights, I would run away, hitch hiking back home, as little as 10-14 years old. They got divorced and my mom left without me, I was taken away by the Welfare and was placed with other people for a while. After that I was placed back with my mother and her soon to be husband in a small little town outside Bloemfontein. At the age of 16 years old, when I came from school one day I found my mother shot and killed, the case is still open at the Highcourt in Bloemfontein, as it never was resolved. Was she killed, or did she commit suicide, for months I worked closely with the police to investigate, after the court case that time, which was very difficult I had no place to stay, so I end up staying with my brother and his wife.  I left school and start to look for a job, I got sold to a Escort Agency for 8 months. I was told to go to a place for an interview, I never went home, I stayed there for 8 months. I was abused and sexually abused by different men, I was very very young. I could not handle it anymore, so I ran away, I stayed in Bloemfontein on the streets for a long time. My stepmother took me in and my life started to change. During the time that I was 14 to 17 years old I was involved in Satanism, I hardly knew what it was, when it was exposed, I had the police escorting me to school for protection. By the time that I was 7 years old I was addicted to pain killers. I was a prostitute for 8 months and it was hell. I was hated by many and I hated many. I slept on streets, I was an alcoholic and I was alone. I am very afraid of being in a small room, as I was kept in a closet for hours for protection. I saw my mother having sex with many men in front of me, which I would then hit the road and run away.  I tried to commit suicide two times, both times I ended up in institutions. I had sleeping therapy and 4 brain shocks, treatments. I hated my life, I always wished I was never born, I was told by many “I wish you were never born”, but God created me and He created me for a reason. The day before my mom passed away I was told that the father that brought me up was not my father, I did confront him before he passed away in 2010, and I was told I am not his daughter. I am a better person today, yes I do have flaws and yes I make mistakes every day, but am I stronger…Yes…I am. I have a very very strong and soft spot in my heart for people that are abused, sexually and emotionally. I have a certain soft heart for prostitutes, I hate human trafficking as it is a evil on its own. I have a soft spot for children, being victims of molestation and being abused. If there is anything I can do to help, I will go out of my way. There is hundreds of people out there that need a hand, what CAN I do to help! A soft hand, a soft smile, and eyes that can tell another person, I love you, Jesus loves you, I am here to help, is what they need.. How Jesus loves His people, how big is the tears that falls down his face every day! I love God and I live for Him, I am an instrument in His hands and whatever and wherever He wants to take me, I am willing. Please understood there is many many people out there living in hell, it is things we as humans don’t want to talk about, but we MUST, it is the truth, hundreds of kids are being molested, sexual slaves, sold out, and here we do nothing, It is time to TALK and safe lives!  To God all the Glory and I am thanking Him for being in MY life. I love Him deeply. Originally published on Ruth Jacobs, Soul Destruction"," The Global Slavery Index estimates that approximately 248,700 people live in conditions of modern slavery in South Africa. 43% of victims in forced labour were identified by the Walk Free survey to be subjected to commercial sexual exploitation. Though the purchasing of sex is criminalised, the sex industry thrives on the street, in brothers and in private residences. South African women, women from neighbouring states and Thai, Chinese, Russian and Brazilian women have been identified as victims of commercial sexual exploitation in South Africa. South African women have also been trafficked abroad, predominantly to Europe.  Elanie was abused and neglected from a very young age. She was sexually molested until the age of 14 years old by both her mother’s boyfriends, teachers and her brother. Alcohol featured at an early age during her life, being given it to keep her quiet from the age of 6. After she left school Elanie was looking for work when she was sold to an escort agency and subjected to sexual abuse by numerous men for 8 months."
Suzzan Blac,2012 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location),""," The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. Of those identified through the NRM, the majority were adults classified as victims of sexual exploitation followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation. While a number of victims are trafficked from other countries such as Albania, Romania and Nigeria into the UK, UK residents are also vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation.  Suzzan Blac was born in 1960 in Birmingham to a dysfunctional family in which she experienced physical, emotional and sexual abuse. In 1976 she travelled to London for what she thought was a job interview, after meeting with her employer and having her mother sign a contract and consent form Suzzan thought she would begin a new life in London. However, she was taken to an old hotel building, raped by her employer and multiple other men before being forced, along with other young girls, to perform sexually in front of both a video and still camera. Subjected daily to threats, beatings and rape, Suzzan learned how to numb her mind. At the age of 16 Suzzan was able to escape from her traffickers with the help of one of the men involved in the trafficking ring. However, while she may have been physically free, she felt her mind was still trapped. At the age of 18 filled with guilt, shame and self-blame she sought medical help but was not given the support she needed by doctors who either gave her drugs to numb her feelings or abused her further. It wasn’t until the birth of her daughter at the age of 28 that Suzzan says she began to recognise her past abuse and the understanding of true motherhood. During the years 2000-2004 she was compelled to paint 42 images about her abuse in order to help process her pain and trauma into something tangible. Suzzan did not reveal these paintings for a further 10 years, finally deciding in 2011 that being a survivor was not enough, she wanted to be a voice for other survivors. Suzzan’s work is now exhibited around the world and she continues to be a voice for survivors, using her blog on The Violence of Pornography and her art in seminars to train social workers on child sexual abuse and trafficking. "

Adam,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Lithuania (trafficked from) ,Northern Ireland (slavery location),""," The United Kingdom remains a significant destination for men, women and children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour. Originating primarily from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, people travel to the UK under promises of a better education, job opportunities and quality of life. As noted in the UK government’s 2015 review of modern slavery, migrant workers are trafficked to the UK for forced labour in agriculture, construction, food processing and domestic servitude. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children.  Unable to find a job in Lithuania, Adam found a job in farming online with an agency in Northern Ireland.

He was forced to work long hours without breaks and was only allowed to leave the farm to buy food from a specific store chosen by his employer. With his passport confiscated and unable to save any money, Adam didn’t know how to get out of his situation. "
Alisha,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Northern Ireland (trafficked from),Northern Ireland (slavery location),""," UK children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Children in the care system and unaccompanied migrant children are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. At least one child a day is trafficked into Britain according the to the Human Trafficking Foundation, with children forced to work in the sex industry, domestic service, cannabis cultivation or as criminal on the streets.  Child victims of human trafficking primarily originate from Romania, Vietnam, Nigeria, and from within the UK itself.   After her mum left home and her dad started drinking, Alisha looked for friendship in a group of older people outside of school. Thinking they cared about her, Alisha accepted alcohol and drugs from them. Once she became hooked, her friends demanded she pay them for what they had given her, forcing her to perform sexual services under the threat of violence. "
Gilberto,2011 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour,Brazil (trafficked from) Forced labour,Brazil (slavery location),""," Brazil is a source country for men and boys trafficked internally for forced labor which accounts for most instances of modern slavery in Brazil. It is particularly prevalent in manual labour sectors such as construction, manufacturing, factory and domestic work and occurs in rural and urban areas, mainly through debt bondage schemes. In rural areas workers are immobilised in estates until they can pay off debts often fraudulently incurred; their identity documents and work permits are frequently retained; they are often physically threatened and punished by armed guards and some have been killed while attempting to flee. Debt bondage involves abusive labour contracting schemes operated by contractors known locally as empreiteiros or gatos, often engaged in other types of seasonal labour contracts.   Gilberto went looking for work when he was recruited to work in a forest cutting trees. Forced to work long hours with little food and pay, Gilberto tried to leave his situation but was told by the gato that recruited him that he owed him money for the tools, food and transport and had to pay off his debt before he could leave. After five months of malnutrition and witnessing the sexual abuse of young boys, Gilberto ran away.  "
Tonya,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"","Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. When Tonya was 13, she met Eddie at the apartment she was living in with her mother in the Dallas, Texas, area. His estranged wife was the property manager. Tonya was classmates with Eddie’s stepdaughter, so the two would often see each other at the apartment and in the local grocery store. It was there that the two first exchanged numbers. Things began to change one night when Tonya ran into Eddie at a bar. The two reconnected, the flirting picked up where it left off and Tonya went home with Eddie that night. Tonya was a runaway at the time, so she eventually moved in with Eddie and the two began a relationship. It was a “normal” arrangement at first. Tonya would cook, clean and look after Eddie’s kids from time to time. However, it was when the two were at a party filled with alcohol and drugs that the relationship took a turn. After nearly 30 more minutes of constant pressure, Tonya agreed to have sex with the man. What she thought would be a one-time thing became an everyday routine for the next few weeks. Night after night and bar after bar, Tonya would go out with Eddie while he advertised her to potential “suitors.” Tonya thought she loved him. She felt she could deal with the physical toll the trafficking took on her body. It turned out that the hardest part to deal with was the emotional and psychological effects.  "

Jasmine,2017 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location) Ghana (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Italy (slavery location),""," Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the most widespread for of modern slavery with an 84% of victims trafficked for this purpose. The majority of those trafficked for this purpose are women and young girls who often originate from Eastern Europe within the EU as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority of people being trafficked from Nigeria to various parts of Europe including Italy, France, Spain and the UK through an array of complex trafficking networks.  Jasmine was sold to a man when she was 5 years old. At the age of 9 she was taken to Italy and forced to be a prostitute. At 15 years old she was brought to the UK where her sexual exploitation continued. Jasmine was finally able to escape when she came back after being with a client to an empty house. It was at this time that she decided to run away. "
Grace A,2017 (Narrative date),Children Domestic slavery Sexual exploitation,Nigeria (trafficked from) Domestic slavery Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is Grace and I am 20 years old. I grew up in the capital of Nigeria, Lagos, but when I was 10 years old my parents died in a car crash and everything in my life changed. I didn’t have any other family to stay with so I slept on the streets for a long time; I had to beg for food to survive. A few years later I met a woman called Rose at a local market who said that she was looking for someone to help her around the house with things like cooking and cleaning and that she would give me somewhere to stay and she would pay me. I stayed with her for about two years; she made me work really long hours and never paid me any wages, but I still thought it was better than sleeping on the streets. When I was 15, Rose said that her friend in England needed a domestic worker that she could trust. She said the woman would be able to pay me well and that she would help me go to school too. I thought it sounded perfect, I always wanted to study to be a beautician and I was desperate to start afresh somewhere else. Rose paid for my passport and arranged the flights to London. We flew to England together and I remember being really excited because I’d never been on a plane before. When we arrived, we went to a house somewhere outside London. Rose told me that I would have to work as a prostitute. At first I didn’t believe her, but then the next day a man called John* came round and he raped me – I was terrified; I hadn’t had sex before. Rose said that if I didn’t do what she said, then John would keep beating me until I did. She also told me that the passport she got me was fake, and if I went to the police for help I would be put in prison, and if I tried to go back to Nigeria, her family would find me and kill me. Rose left me in the house with John and she went back to Nigeria. John forced me to have sex with lots of different men who came to the house. It was horrible and I was desperate to leave. Some of them beat me and sometimes they didn’t use condoms so I was given a pill to take everyday. The men were paying to have sex with me but I didn’t get any of the money and I wasn’t allowed outside. After about three months, I noticed that the front door was left open so I ran away. I slept on the streets for a few days until I was found by the police; they said that I had been trafficked and told me to apply for asylum. I was pregnant at this point and was sent to live in a hostel in the north of England, but one day when I was seven months pregnant, the authorities came and took me to a detention centre. I didn’t understand why this was happening because the police said I was trafficked. I had to stay in a horrible cell for two months and didn’t get any healthcare even though I was heavily pregnant. They wouldn’t tell me why I was being held there. The church that I had been attending before I was put in the detention centre raised enough money to get me a lawyer. The lawyer found out that I was taken to detention because my asylum claim had been rejected, so she put in an appeal. I was released just before giving birth, but six months later they took me and my baby, Lydia* to another detention centre. The room we stayed in had no cot and no one ever changed the sheets. I was so depressed– it was Rose and the men who had broken the law, but my little girl and I were being punished. I met someone from Poppy at the second detention centre and after putting in another appeal, I was finally released because they recognised I was trafficked. Afterwards I went to live in one of Poppy’s safe houses; I had my own room with lots of space for Lydia’s baby things, and I started to feel safe. I had a support worker who was always on the other end of the phone if I needed help; they helped me get counselling and I’m learning how to be a good mother. I’ve started college now too and am on my way to becoming a beautician like I’d always wanted. I am one of the lucky ones because Poppy was able to help me, but I know there are lots of women like me who aren’t able to get the help they need. Although I am still angry about what happened to me, I want to be a good mother to Lydia and make something of my life. I think I am getting there.   As told to Eaves for Women Poppy Project  "," The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014.

Ada,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Sierra Leone (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"Life in Sierra Leone was difficult. My father beat me a lot when I was growing up and yelled at me all the time. When I decided to convert to Christianity my parents threw me out of the house, so I went to live with a friend and worked in a restaurant to support myself. I was quite happy to be living independently. I had been with my boyfriend Paul* for about six months and we often talked about moving abroad to find work and get married; we were in love. Paul suggested that we move to the UK because he had an uncle there. I thought it would be a good opportunity to start a new life and maybe go back to school so that I could become a teacher. Paul arranged everything and we travelled together to London. I carried my own papers and travel documents. I was happy and excited to be going to London to start my life with Paul. Paul’s uncle picked us up from the airport and we went to a house together. Paul said that he was going out for a bit and that I should stay with his uncle; after Paul left his uncle raped me. I was devastated and felt helpless. A few hours later his uncle came into the room and said that Paul had gone back to Sierra Leone and that I had to work as a prostitute until I had paid back the £5,000 it cost to bring me here. He raped me again and told me that he would keep doing it until I agreed to pay back the money. I couldn’t believe that Paul could do this to me. I was devastated. I was taken to a brothel and made to work there for six months. One time after a few months, Paul called me. He wanted me to know that if I tried to escape or went back to Sierra Leone, he would find me and hurt me. I asked how he could do this to me; he laughed and said that his uncle owned me now. There were five other women at the brothel. I had to have sex with two or three men a day and I was kept locked in at all times. I had to see customers at whatever time they came to the brothel, so I was often woken up in the middle of the night. The men who ran the brothel threatened me and often hit me, so I was afraid to say no. I was also afraid to ask the customers for help because the men at the brothel told me that they would find out and beat me. At first I used to cry a lot, but after a few months I realised there was no point because nobody would help me. Usually the customers wanted safe sex, but sometimes they wouldn’t use a condom. They paid more when they wanted this. I saw a lot of bad things whilst I was at the brothel. I saw the other women being beaten and raped. I was raped too. I escaped at New Year, when the men held a New Year’s Eve party. This was the first time that the door wasn’t locked, so when nobody was looking I ran out of the back door. I slept in a park for a few nights before a woman asked me if I was ok. I told her about the brothel and Paul; she took me to a police station because she said that there are people who can help me. The police spoke to Eaves’ Poppy Project and the same day I moved into one of their safe houses. I had a support worker at Poppy who was really nice and went with me to appointments with the police, solicitor and doctor. I felt sad for a while, but after a few months I made some friends in the Poppy house and began to think that I would be ok. Eaves encouraged me to go to some art and drama classes to build my confidence and they also helped me to claim asylum because I can’t go back to Sierra Leone. I recently moved into my own flat and am now at college and on my way to becoming a teacher; the reason I came to the UK. I will be eternally grateful to Eaves for helping me put my life back together.” As told to Eaves for Women Poppy Project"," The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014.

Barbara (Narrative 2),2017 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),"Looking back on how very young I was, I’m always amazed when I see young children today. I didn’t have a clear plan, as much as I was running away from circumstances, looking back now I was looking for something too. I think that every child needs the same thing, they need love, family, a roof over their head, food. I was looking for a lot of those things and running away from some things as well. A question I get a lot is why didn’t you just leave? Why don’t they just leave? I always try to make people understand Trauma Bonding and Stockholm Syndrome (occurs as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change). Traffickers target vulnerable people, they don’t care who it is, if you are vulnerable, their job is to target you, whether it is a 12 year old runaway or a 35 year old man just starving, whose family is starving and he is trying to find. I was a perfect walking target, I was very vulnerable. I didn’t have a rescue group or anything like that, I was alone. My trafficker had actually been arrested and sent to prison and I didn’t even know.  By that point, at age 22, I was heavily addicted to heroin. I actually pulled myself into a drug clinic and a member of staff went above and beyond to intake me and for whatever reason she took an interest in me. She started talking to me and she talked to me like a human being. She looked me in my eyes and for the first time in years somebody treated me like I mattered – like I was a real human being. I had an epiphany – this grand moment in 2012. I know it sounds very dramatic and over-dramatised, but I was sitting in my living room, the TV was on in the background, I wasn’t really watching it.  At that point my life, I was in a dark depression, I wasn’t talking to anyone, I was isolating myself, never told anyone all those years. I’m also a cancer survivor and the cancer that I had is directly related to the fact that I was trafficked. I had uterine cancer. It was related to HPV, (HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection – there are many different types of HPV, some types can cause health problems including genital warts and cancers) I know for a fact the reason I had it so severe according to the doctor, was because of the fact that I was a survivor and a victim of human trafficking I had recovered from cancer, I was very depressed and I heard the news come on and I heard them talking about human trafficking and I had never heard that term before in my life. I had heard drug trafficking, but I hadn’t heard human trafficking. They were mentioning that they had a really large case of human trafficking, victims had been rescued not too far from my home and then they started talking about the recruitment techniques that these gang members use to recruit young women and young girls. That is when I had the great epiphany and I realised for the first time in my life. I was angry that it was still happening and I had this idea that I wanted to do something. Within a couple of weeks, I was sharing my story on the same news channel.  Then I just started doing whatever I could do to make a difference, that’s all. In the US and the western world, people don’t think that it’s happening. Quite frequently when I speak, people will come up to me afterwards and they will say, they didn’t know it was happening here. I also have people that will come up to me and share some trauma of their own because I guess they feel empowered after someone else has shared their story. I have a phobia about public speaking; I’m not a public speaker. However, I recently had someone tell me, you can’t say that anymore because you’ve been doing it for a long time now and you are good. I really still feel like that when I go to speak, it’s horrible. Even in my TED talk I was shaking. First of all if there are any victims of human trafficking present I want them to know that it wasn’t their idea or their fault, like I thought for so many years. I want other people who think ‘why are you talking about human trafficking, it really doesn’t affect me at all,’ to know that whilst you might think that – it does affect you. It affects you in many many ways. If you are a tax payer and you are working, it affects you as all those victims that are having medical services and social services and all those type of services – you are paying for that. If it doesn’t affect you morally, it is affecting your pocket, so you should care about it one way or another. If you have children you should be very scared because today traffickers can be right in your living room, on your television, on your computer, iPhone or iPad. It happens in streets, at school, wherever there are people, there are traffickers waiting. I just want people to know that it is happening here and they should care because it is not a victim-less crime. It is far from a victim-less crime, it is a very violent crime. We as a society have to change all these beliefs and viewpoints and view each other as human beings. It is about supply and demand and about vulnerability. Traffickers wouldn’t have a business if there wasn’t a demand for it. I was arrested so many times whilst I was being trafficked and I was labelled as a criminal even though I was the victim."," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. Young people who run away from home are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation by traffickers: the Department of Justice estimates that 293,000 youth are at risk.

Barbara Amaya ran away from an abusive home in North Virginia at 12 years old. By the age of 16 in 1972 she had been sent to three detention centres and lived on the streets of Washington DC and New York City. She spent over 10 years as a victim of commercial sexual exploitation where she was forced to work as a prostitute and hooked on heroin. Today Barbara works to bring awareness of the adversity that survivors of violence and trauma have overcome and trains law enforcement, health care professionals, teachers and counsellors how to interact with victims."
Petra,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Czech Republic,"It was like any other day and one of my girlfriends from my college, her parents had a cabin up in a mountain, and sometimes we would go there for a weekend and just have fun as friends. So she invited me. I was 16. I was just trying to walk you know from the bus station to the train station. I was just grabbed from behind by a few men and I was drugged and next time I know I just passed out and woke up you know in a car, on the floor of a car. And I was tied up erm you know first instinct. I just came from, basically what just happened? I was disorientated, I was tied up, I had no idea where I am, I don’t, I didn’t know what was happening to me. You know and I was trying to scream for help, you know they just beat me even then much more because they said you know don’t scream, there is no hope for you, just no matter how much you scream it doesn’t matter.  I was, I was really pretty much down on the floor, and because they didn’t want me to probably know where are they taking me. Um so um, next time I know, they get me out of the car and from throw me straight through, it was abandoned, abandoned apartment. It was post-criminal, beat up apartment and they throw me in one room, but I was along and there was only filthy mattress on the floor. They strip me naked, and tie me to the wall. And I was just at that point, I knew that basically I’m in a, more than trouble. Erm I was raped first by the men who kidnapped me and then after a few hours, they started to brought in customers. Because there were men coming in the room and you know they all had you know, sexual ads with me. Urm you just really, it’s almost like a vision. Like it’s almost like you are in like you really don’t understand how can somebody do these things to somebody else. Interviewer: and were there, are there other girls that this was happening to in this apartment? Petra: Erm one for sure I know of. She was in the next room because I heard her through the wall. Erm Interviewer: Were you able to talk to each other? Petra: We didn’t really communicate because we were afraid if they will hear us we’ll get into trouble. Erm but it was more of the… I heard her going through what she had to do, through her, you know screaming and moaning, and she knew when I was. So there was kind of that connection of um like I understand what you’re going through. I don’t know her name, I never find out. I don’t know her age, she, they took her life, the, the, they shot her, I heard a shot and I never heard her ever again. At this point I just said, okay I’m gonna die here, but I don’t want to die like, I don’t want to die like an animal, and I don’t want to die sad. So the, just that last piece of me basically said, what can I do for these last minutes of my life what would make me happy, because I don’t want to go like that. And erm you know when I was little there a little song. It’s about a bird. And that song I used to sing when I was little, when I was about 4 years old. Over and over again. And that song for some reason makes me very very happy. And my parents were sick of the song my, I would like take a breath and go over again and it’s kind of interesting because the song is about a bird who’s being captured by the family, and they erm kill the bird, they plug bird and they ate the bird. I don’t know, but the tune of the song was so like upbeat and erm I was like oh this is like the greatest thing. And I always made, in my mind as a girl like, well no they didn’t kill the bird and I, in my mind, I save the bird. So you know, when I was lying in that room, having really nothing left, that song just flow in my head and I started to hum it and I started to like sing it just under my breath. And I started to feel kind of like I had that 4 year old girl vision in front of me, of being really really happy. I started to sing that song over and over and over again, and for some reason, that song really empowered me. And I’m like, you know what? I’m not gonna die here. I’m like, I’m gonna try to do something. Um I’m like, if it try to run, if they catch me I’m dead anyway, so I have really nothing to lose. Erm so I noticed that next to the mattress where I was lying at, there was a window and it was boarded with just like a plywood, really thin sheet of wood. I kick it out and I ran. I just grabbed my clothes, just put in on and I ran, I ran, I ran. And eventually I realised kind of part of town I am at. I started to be more oriented, so I get… Interviewer: You’d been close all that time? Petra: I was really close. I was only let’s say 30 miles away from my house. Erm so I ran all the way to my parent’s house and I sneak in and I went straight to the bathroom. I tried to wash off all of it. Interviewer: How many days had passed by this point? Since you’ve been kidnapped. Petra: It’s been 3 days. Interviewer: So it was nightime, so you family though you’d gone away for the weekend. They didn’t even know. Petra: They had no idea. Interviewer: and you didn’t tell them? Petra: I didn’t tell them. I was so afraid that they would come and find me that I didn’t tell them. Interviewer: That the men would come and find you. Petra: Mmhmm Interview: Was there a period afterwards that you couldn’t be around men at all? Petra: There was a period where I didn’t want to deal with society period. I didn’t want to be around women. I felt like I’m walking around outside naked, screaming for help and people are passing by and no one can hear you. And that feeling of hopelessness is absolutely the most painful thing I ever experienced. Interviewer: But there was light at the end of the tunnel, for those watching. Petra: There was yes. Interviewer: You are happily married seven years. Petra: Yes yes yes. But you know, I had to go through the therapy, I really had to commit myself that I am willing to change how I feel about this ordeal. Like I said you don’t forget it but yes there is a hope. There is a way when you feel about it differently and it doesn’t hurt anymore. Interviewer: What would you say to someone who’s in this situation that would have shortened that healing process for you? Petra: I think that if I would take back time if I could, you do go and tell somebody right away. Because erm not only they can you know wither report a case but it also it gives you the chance to talk about it which is, in the beginning, you feel like you never want to talk about it, but you know, I realise years later how important it is. Interviewer: So for every one Petra, is hundreds of others that are in this situation? What is something that you would like to say to those victims who’ve survived as well? What’s one last message that you would share with them. Petra: Don’t give up hope. That is always, that is people who cares about you. Try not to focus on these people, on these monsters. Focus on those people who are the good people. Focus on your family and focus on yourself and believe in good in yourself, because you are good, you are good. As told to Kirsty Spraggon for Kirsty TV"," There are an estimated 42,600 people living in modern slavery in the Czech Republic.

Petra was on her way to meet a friend was grabbed from behind, drugged and put in a car. She was taken to an abandoned apartment, stripped naked, tied to the wall and raped by her kidnappers. She was forced to provide sexual services to strangers under the threat of violence and death. Petra was able to escape through a boarded-up window, and realising where she, was able to run the 30 miles back to her parent's house. "
Debbie,2006 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"So I went and I started to go give her a hug And that's when she pushed me in the car. She tied up my hands first, and then she put the tape over my mouth. And she put tape over my eyes. While she was putting tape on me, Matthew told me if I screamed or acted stupid, he'd shoot me. So I just stayed quiet. He goes, 'If I was to shoot you right now, where would you want to be shot -- in your head, in your back or in your chest? And then I hear him start messing with his gun. And he counted to three and then he pulled the trigger. And then I was still alive. I opened my eyes, and I just saw him laughing. ""And then that's when I heard them say there was a middle-aged guy in the living room that wanted to take advantage of a 15-year-old girl, And then he goes, 'Bend her over. I want to see what I'm working with.' And that's when he started to rape me. And I see more guys, four other guys had come into the room. And they all had a turn. It was really scary. They were asking me if I was hungry. I told them no. That's when they put a dog biscuit in my mouth, trying to get me to eat it. I ended up in the dog kennel. I had no other choice. I didn't know them, But most of them were married, with kids. And every single one of them, I asked them why they were coming to me if they had a wife at home. ... They didn't have an answer. So, like, I felt so nasty. [Debbie did not try to escape as the pimps told her they would go after her family] After they told me that, I didn't care what happened to me as long as my family stayed alive, And that's pretty much what I had in my head. Staying there to keep my family alive. [Police had previously searched the apartment Debbie was being kept in but she had been tied up and put into a drawer under the bed] I didn’t know what to say; I was just lying under the bed, stiff as a board, shaking. And then he opens the middle drawer and I was like ‘Oh my God!’. I was so relieved. And then that’s when my… I was standing there, and my knees started… they gave out. I was so happy. I was so happy to see my mom. I was so happy to be home. I’m able to be with my family. I don’t know – it’s crazy.   Courtesy of ABC News"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States.

Miya,2006 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"He asked if it would be out of place if he said I was pretty. I was like, 'No.' I mean, it was a compliment. He said that he was a model agent, [that] he was looking for new models in the area, it’s not like something I've been wanting to do or anything, but, I mean, it was ... it seemed interesting. They said they were on their way to California to go back to their office and they were going to do some more photo shoots, and they wanted me to go along with them. He said that I could probably make about a thousand or more. ... He said I could try it for three days. ... And so, I went with them. They used just a cheap camera you can buy, the throwaway, and they said once we get to California that we would be at a photo shoot, and that they'd be using, uh, some really good equipment, they'd have makeup artists and stuff like that. He showed me a website that he put them up on, and it was an escort service site. I mean, I was really far away from my house, and I didn't know where to go. I waited till they were completely asleep. And I put my suitcase by the door. And I was about to leave and ...sure enough, the phone rings. [Miya handed her captor his phone and told him she was going downstairs for a cigarette] And that was the last time I talked to him. I grabbed my suitcase, and I ran to the elevator and I got outside and I started running until I got as far away as I possibly could. I was just so glad I was out of their reach. [The police asked Miya to help catch the man who had lured her away from the mall] They found out what room he was in. He tried jumping out the window.

Evelyn,2014 (Narrative date),Children Domestic slavery,Cameroon (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,United States (slavery location),"So again thank you, I’m honoured to be here and as a fan of Trust Women I had to do this. Erm my name is Evelyn Chumbow, I am a survivor activist for Inside Human Trafficking. So erm again most of you probably know me, and most of you don’t. I was trafficked from the age of nine until seventeen and erm the promise was to get a good education. Again, I just wanted to marry Will Smith [laughter]. And I wanted Bill Cosby to be my dad. But that didn’t happen, that American dream was completely gone so it wasn’t like The Cosby or the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air or 90210. Instead I became a domestic servitude in a house taking care of two children, cleaning and cooking and no schooling from aged nine until seventeen. And you know, being abused everyday mentally, physically and thanks to a lot of great people I got help. You know, I am now an advocate around the world and in the US so I am honoured to be here, thank you. Erm, first I want to say, it’s really funny because looking back at my situation, and one other person that was like the heart of my situation is actually here, you know Melanie on heart, my lawyer. So she was in the beginning of everything and I owe her a lot of gratitude. So post-trauma, and especially in our current situation, I hate this term illegal immigrants, I really do. Because when you talk about illegal immigrants, especially when it comes to children, you have to wonder how the children got here. So I’m an example of an illegal immigrant, an undocumented child. I came here illegally which I did not know. I did not know. I did not know that I need a green card to be here. I did not know I need a working permit for me to be here. Again, I came here at the age of 9 for a promise to get a better education and, then when I came here that was not the promise I got. You know, I end up cooking and cleaning, taking care of kids, being abused physically and mentally, and one of my punishments, I had to take off my clothes and get beat, beaten. One of my punishments again I had to stand up from like 10pm to like 5am in the morning. You know, and no school education, no contact with my family members. And you know, afterward you know, I decided, you know, I ran away. I was trafficked twice. Once by my trafficker and once by a family member. So I ran away, went to a church, went and told my story to a church and from there, everything was happening. Law enforcement and FBI were right there which, we’re working on it but thank you. They were right there and you know, asking a lot of questions, you know. Especially for someone who did not know that I needed green card to work in a country. Like ‘oh you’re lying, you’re telling you’re story because you just want papers’ and for somebody not like, again, we don’t know any of that. We just want to see Will Smith [laughter]. So you know from there, magic happened. I got into foster care, I’m really grateful, you know my, my you know, my story got erm prosecuted by, prosecuted. Until they went all the way to Cameroon, you got investigate it, talk about it. But it was like what happened after. You get the green card, you get the working permit. What’s left? And I’m placed into foster care, which is another issue but because I had ‘somebody’ there that was always helping me. But it was really hard because life in foster care was another story of its own and again I couldn’t do a lot of things like other kids that were Americans. Because I still didn’t have my documents, it was like a field trip to go to Canada, I couldn’t go because I didn’t have a passport. Which brings, you know, so it really pisses me off most of the time when they talk about illegal immigrants and undocumented kids because, most of us are trafficked here to this country. And we, we’re not asked to be brought here. And we’re just walking around, trying to figure out life. But I’m one of those undocumented kids that went by the rules. I pay my taxes [laughter], I graduated, you know, it took a while. [Laughter]. You know, I’m working at one of the greatest law firms ever Baker and McKenzie. And you know I’m also a voice to help this issue to make sure it doesn’t happen again. You know, and it’s just really, it’s just there’s a lot of work to do afterwards long term. You know as far as like they talk about bondage. We, we’re locked in a house, we have no issues of the outside world. We don’t even know about our taxes or how to get a job or how to get a lot of things. You know, a lot of the time most organisations focus on rescuing us. And first of all we should stop saying rescue [laughter]. Most of the time they work about rescuing us. What happens next? Now we, people know about modern day slavery, but now you got to think of post. What happens next? What is going after? Making sure we get our compensation like Martina is doing, yes. But you know there is just so much to do afterwards. And we’re grateful that you want to help us but let’s talk about what happens next.   This narrative was recorded at Trust Conference, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s flagship event.

Labour trafficking exists in multiple forms including domestic servitude, forced labour in agriculture, fishing, and construction across the United States, with domestic servitude being one of the most difficult to detect as traffickers are able to keep people isolated and intimidated. Among those trafficked for domestic servitude in the US are children, lured to the US with the promises of a brighter future.  At 9 years old Evelyn Chumbow was presented with an opportunity to travel from Cameroon to the United States to receive an education. Dreaming for the best for their daughter, her parents packed up her belongings and put her on a plane with a Cameroonian recruiter. However, when Evelyn reached the US she was forced to cook, clean and take care of the children of the recruiter. Never paid for her work and subjected to daily beatings Evelyn never received the education she was promised. After 7 years of domestic servitude, Evelyn was able to escape. She is now a vocal survivor activist working to raise awareness and educate on modern slavery."
Jennifer,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I grew up in an abusive, dysfunctional family and was sexually assaulted of my virginity at a young age. It left me with a number of vulnerabilities and I ended up having some domestic violence relationships. Erm which lead me to my ‘knight in shining armour’, my ‘Prince Charming’. And I was then groomed into a life that I never knew existed at that point. Through fraud, manipulation, coercion erm emotional fulfilment. As well as a drug addiction as well that was used to lure me in erm into this relationship and grooming process. It then changed the dynamics of things when another female and my original trafficker approached me and got me tied into debt bondage. More manipulation, coercion, fraud that led me into a life of being sexually exploited. At the age of 25 years old. Erm there was a lot of things that tied into my story including delivering my own child on the streets. I was kidnapped by a fellow trafficker, held hostage erm. I was raped with a butcher knife. One of the many assaults that took place. Beat, threatened violently. Erm I was terrified. However, you know, I had a life changing pivotal moment after that rape with the butcher knife, and was able to escape that life of enslavement. I realised that that ‘Prince Charming’ was my, my captor, after he sold me to a gang. And after my escape I started to rebuild my life, which is a very hard, difficult struggle and I was really caught up because I was still psychologically enslaved. See each time I was traded off from my original trafficker to the gangs, what have you, I was branded. I was marked as cattle, as property and of who my owner was and who I belonged to. And so I earned enough money for my first cover up and realised what my purpose was in one of the cover-ups. Was to pay forward the freedom, mercy and grace that had been given to me in helping other survivors of human trafficking that had been branded or scarred with violence, erm reclaim their bodies through removing or covering their, their brandings. So I started Survivors Ink in order to dothat. We also raise awareness, create advocacy, resource connection for survivors to help them in their journey. We are survivor led; most of our volunteers are survivors. And it’s just really amazing to be a part of, you know this fight against trafficking. I feel it’s my duty to be here to share my story so that the public can understand what happened and help stand with us to put a stop to modern day slavery. My escape was only an act of mercy from my Creator. After that two and a half hour erm brutal rape with a butcher knife, I found myself at the end of a rope…literally tied round my neck twice, hanging. Feeling the misery, the addiction, the enslavement, the trauma, all leaving out the bottoms of my feet. And that feeling got to my knees and I hit the floor and I was really angry. You know, I couldn’t even die to be put out of my misery. And yet a voice came out of nowhere and said ‘I have purpose for you and it’s not to die in the basement of a crack-house’. Erm thankfully I did discover what that purpose was. Is helping my brothers and sisters by using my story to raise money, raise awareness in order to help them in their journeys. Erm going off Evelyn there, yes once we escape, there’s a whole new hell. It’s not easy you know. You can rescue us all you want. That’s not what we need. We need opportunity, we need opportunities not just for counselling and we don’t want your pity, we don’t want your sensationalised story seeking coming our way. We want jobs, we want education, we want choices, we want our children back. I know some of my post issues you know I have $20 000 worth of child support debt that’s owed because I was enslaved. I can’t get a passport. I can’t leave this country. You know I, there needs to be more start up money for survivors who want to start their own business, you know I had to invest, I’m in current debt right now because I started an LLC on top of the non-profit. You know I had to have money in order to get that going. I know that funding is huge. I have to work tirelessly to try to make sure that our non-profit, me and the small group of volunteers that we have doing fundraising, you know. Working tirelessly to make sure that these applications that we have around the world of survivors needing services are able to be fulfilled. But some of these bigger NGOs are getting it and only putting 12 cents to the dollar towards direct services. That’s not okay. That’s not okay. We need more direct services, we need more resources, we need more opportunity. We need more choice.   This narrative was recorded at Trust Conference, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s flagship event.

Jennifer was eventually able to escape and devoted her time to promote awareness and advocate for social change.

Deependra,2014 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Nepal (trafficked from),Qatar (slavery location),"My name is Deependra Giri and I have been trafficked and er worked as forced labour in Qatar for many years in terrible conditions as a modern day slave. Later when I, when Monique came in touch with me and I was invited for Trust Women Conference in 2013 and ‘14 and she and a few of her friends they helped me and so I was able to start, I established an NGO called the safety First Foundation. And er we established that in 2014 and from that time we are like, we are moving in a very slow speed trying to help people, the trial against human trafficking and modern slavery. So that we can, as we know that we cannot stop people going to the Gulf to work but at least we can er give them proper counselling and aware them, like what are the things that they should keep in mind when they are going for the Gulf migration. So they should have their emergency contact numbers of the human rights in Qatar, the embassy of Nepal in Qatar and the labour court and all these things. When I went to Qatar in 2008 I was, I had a dream that I will go there and I will have a decent job and a good salary so that I can er help my family financially. But at the same time I was aware that it’s er not, as easy as I’m thinking about that, dreaming about that. So when I went to Qatar, as soon as I get off, er went out of the airport, my passport was taken away and I was like, what is this going to happen with me. The guy who took away my passport, I didn’t know who was that person. So he took me to the industrial areas, er the labour camp, and it was midnight and this accommodation of the labourers was more looking like er, er, go down, you know. And he, as we bed he asks me that you sleep now and that you must be feeling tired and tomorrow in the morning we will take you to the office and we will talk about that. So when I was in Nepal I was promised that I would be working as a clerk in an office, but er the next day when I reached the office, I met one of the operational managers of the company and he said that ok Deependra so you are here to work in the er go down, and you have to work as a, you have to lift heavy things you have to get it from here to there and you have to carry load and a load, all these kind of things. Then I was very scared because the first thing, they took away my passport, I didn’t know who took away my passport. I was searching that face in the office but I didn’t see that guy in the office who took away my passport. And second thing is I was promised that I will be working as a clerk. But there, this operation manager told me I had to work as a labourer to lift heavy things, which I was not mentally or physically prepared for. But one thing I made up my mind that I have travelled a long way, my family is far away from here, I cannot do anything. There is no one where I can, I didn’t know anything, who to go and seek help with you know. So I made up my mind that in any condition I’m going to work here and as I signed a contract that said I cannot leave the country without completing two years. And due to the Kafala system in Qatar, the sponsorship er you cannot leave that job if you don’t like that, you have to complete the contract. And before, if by chance I get my passport I cannot leave the country, because I need my sponsor to sign an exit permit and when I get that exit permit I can, at the immigration when I hand over the exit permit and then only I can leave the country. So I was very scared and afraid and I started working there and after few months, one day I got a chance, the manager came, he was out of the country and he came back and he asked me he said I was invited to his cabin and he asked me like Deependra, we er we give you work visa to work as a clerk and why are you working in the go down? And I said that in your absence the operational manager told me that you have to work as a labourer to load and unload the heavy things. And er so I was working there and I don’t know what to do and what not to do. And so he asked me a few questions and later he asked me to work in the office as a clerk but this was not that I ended up with a good time. After that, back at, in our labour camps in our accommodation there was no electricity, there was no drinking water and we were to sleep on the rooftop, on the rooftop you er, many of you may know what the temperature in Qatar, it’s more than fifty degrees. And we have to sleep on the roof, er on the rooftop and our accommodation was surrounded by cement factories, and when we wake up in the morning we were like, er we just, we coming out of a beauty salon you know, like doing a lot of makeup you know. And so when we complained about that even, er I was scolded by the manager that you have to work and we, we are trying to fix your problems. There were a lot of problems you know, and when my passport was taken away, and after a few months when I met Andrew Gardner I came to know the word modern-day slave. The day when my passport was taken away, from that day I was a modern slave. Migrating to Gulf countries or anywhere for a job and all these things, it’s very, it’s expensive. It’s expensive in Nepal you know because it, you have to pay a huge amount of money to the recruiter and to the men, the recruiting agency, to the brokers and you have to pay for your tickets and then you have to travel to and well you can travel to the Gulf countries you know. And so for that I have arrange like 2000 US dollar or 3000 US dollar to pay to the recruiting agencies or to the brokers you know. Because er, they er, for the visa, though the visa and the ticket is free, but they charge you. And er last year, when I was in Qatar, I came to know that erm some of the big companies, the giant companies in Qatar, the HR managers of these companies who are directly or indirectly very close to the company owners, they negotiate with the recruiting agencies in Nepal that have 100 visa, let’s suppose I have 100 visa for labourers. And so how much are you going to pay me per head? And so when, er so they negotiate and they come to a figure, okay I can pay you $500 per head. And so that is to be paid by later on, in the beginning that is paid by the recruiters, but later on they just charge that with the people. So like me, it’s very expensive, well when everything is counted it’s very expensive for us to pay that you know. And so I don’t have that much money and so I have to take a loan from a person I know or and it’s very had to get a loan from the bank, like keeping your agreement or your visa as a collateral you know. So when I take a loan with some, er individual person and in that case it’s the interest rate are very huge and, and the salaries in the Gulf countries are very less and so it’s very had to survive. You have to send money every, everyone to home and at the same time you have to send the money to the, they money I have taken with you know, and so I have to pay the interest at the same time and I have to pay to look after my family, I have to take care of myself. And er, the things go, very, you know things are very hard when, when you are not paid every month. So I was getting paid after every 3 months. Well I knew that I had signed one agreement, work agreement that I can go back home after completing my work contract of two years. But I knew it is not going to be so easy and, and it was what I thought like, after completing two years when I requested my manager ‘okay, I have completed my two years agreement and so I want to go back home to see my family’. Because when I first went to Qatar I left behind my wife, and my newly born baby girl, she was only one month, and my mum and dad. And so my manager told me that uh, ‘we cannot let you go now because if you are gone back home then who is going to look after you work in office. And so you have to arrange someone in your absence who is going to take care of the job you are going right now’. And I said, I knew many of my friends they were desperate to get job in the Gulf countries because in Nepal unemployment is one of the biggest problem and challenges, but I don’t want to put my friends into that problem which I was facing. So I told my manager I don’t know anyone who I can bring here for in my absence, who is going to take care of the charges and work here. But what I can do is, instead of going for 2 or 3 months’ vacation, just allow me two week vacation.  And I already mentally made up my mind that if I got a chance to go back home, I am never going to come back in the same hell. And so he said ‘No. you have to arrange someone, otherwise we cannot let you go.’ I said ‘no I cannot arrange anyone because I don’t know anyone who can come and do this job’. And so I talked to my general manager and then he was like, I was able to convince him and then he helped me to, he, he said that tokay well let Deependra go back for two weeks and in one condition, one situation. That they, the company is going to hold my 3 month salary, that they will pay me when I’m back from Nepal and just imagine when I don’t have a single penny in my pocket, I’m just trying to go back home because… me and my family was like going through very tough situation financially, and on top of that I was mentally tortured. Er I never said, whenever I talked to my family, I never said that I’m living in such a situation because I don’t want, wanted them to be panic, you know. And er even if I say them, they are helpless you know. So they didn’t give me my salary, and then I was lucky that they said that I, we will pay you three months’ salary and your ticket money when you come back after two weeks. And so I, I took help, financial help with my friends. They helped me to get my, buy my tickets. And so I went and then I asked my manager that okay, can you give me my exit permit because without that the immigration is not let me go. And so they said okay we will give your exit permit and I could not sleep the whole night because next day early morning I had to go to the airport and I don’t have my exit permit in my hand. Next day morning I was in the airport, still I was very much confused and traumatized that I don’t have the exit permit and how can I go? And one guy came in the morning he gave me a call and he said ‘where are you?’ I just met him, he gave me my exit permit. I was so happy. And I said oh my God, this is, it’s worth than my 3 months salary that I got this. It’s the key to my home. You know. And so I went back home. When I reached home, the first thing I hugged my mum, I started crying. That I was  [crying] I was free from [crying]… sorry. So after two week my manager gave me a call that Deependra kay let me, we want to book your tickets and tell me the date when you are coming back. I said ‘I’m sorry to say that, and at the same time I’m very glad to tell you that I’m not going to come back’. And my, and my manager asked me ‘okay then, and what about your salary?’ I said ‘oh that is like a bonus from me to you’. And so I don’t want that money. Still I was, I had some you know, debt you know, and that was er, I was, I was lucky that thank you and Monique and you, you guys helped me in 2013 to pay back all the debt. You know, you and Monique and your friend. So yeah, you guys helped me for that and thank you so much. And you guys also helped me also to set up this NGO and work to fight against the slavery and human trafficking and so now the challenges are much more and we have more responsibilities now. Because er when I was in Qatar it was, I was only having the problem but now we have to take care of other people and we have to try our best that no one is going to face such kind of problems you know. And so, now we have challenges that we are moving very slowly and we, we have to do a lot of things and for that we need financial support. As she told that the, they big NGOs and other things, they get the financial and the funds from all over the world but we are very small, we are nowhere in the world you know. So nobody trust us when we are trying our best to we are trying from our side we are trying our best to make this place a better place to live for everyone. And er we can, we are thinking like how we can stop these problems when government are closing its eyes and they are just sitting blindly and they’re deaf and dumb. You know.  So it’s like, we need, now we are planning to set up a workshop where we can provide free of cost trainings to people erm that the expertise they have. If they are interested to do some farming job we can train them free of cost and if someone wants to do a plumbing job we can train them for the plumbing or carpentry or all these things, you know. And I come from a family where my father is a farmer and a village where I was born, it’s very remote and you know and people are not educated because it’s lack of money, poverty, and all these things. And so we are slowly we are trying to find out people or know reasons we can tie up and we can work with them.   This narrative was recorded at Trust Conference, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s flagship event.

In 2015 an IOM and Walk Free study of 162 exploited migrant workers from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 100% of workers had their identity documents withheld, 87% were confined to their workplace and 76% had their wages withheld. Deependra Giri was looking for work when he was offered a job with a good salary in Qatar as a clerk. Upon arrival, Deependra's passport was confiscated and he was taken to an industrial area where he was forced to undertake manual labour. Due to the Kafala system in Qatar, Deependra was committed to his contract and was unable to leave the country. After completing his 2-year agreement Deependra managed to convince his employer to allow him to go home for 2 weeks to see his family. Once back in Nepal, Deependra informed his manager that he would not be returning."

My family had to sell land, borrow money and even take out a bank loan to pay for it all. We were contracted to build a social housing development in Sembawang. I was paid the promised S$1,000 a month for the first five months, but didn’t get any payment for overtime. Then for three months we got no salary at all. We thought our boss would pay us eventually, but then we discovered he’d fled Singapore. There’s no way to get the money from him now. I have my parents, three sisters and a brother to look after. Now they have to depend on my brother, because I have no money to send home. All I’ve done is make problems for them. We weren’t able to make the monthly repayments, so now we’re in trouble. There’s a 20% fine on the loan, and men from the bank go to my parents’ house every day, shouting at them to pay it back. If we still can’t pay back the bank, they’re going to seize the deeds for my family’s land. The bank’s also lodged a police report against me, so when I do go back to Bangladesh, I might be detained.

Anita B,2017 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,Kenya (trafficked from) Children,Kenya (slavery location),"I was out grazing the cows one day when my father said it was time to get married. He said I was getting older and there was a man interested in me. A fortnight later, the elders and circumcisers were called and a big celebration planned. I was woken up early the next morning and taken outside to be circumcised. The elders said I’d been given to a man and that he was to be my husband. He was 55. I was very confused. I was only 10. My mother tried to explain that I had to live like a woman now and not like a child. But what really worried me was knowing how my mother had suffered as a wife. She got beaten a lot in front of us, and I knew she wouldn’t be able to protect me from my new husband. He already had two wives, and as his third I was expected to look after his goats and cows. A new hut was built for me. Nine months later, because I had still not given him a baby, he began tasking me with all the difficult jobs. I got the first beating after I lost one of his goats. The second was when he found me resting instead of grazing the cows. The third time was because I’d run away. The next morning, after I took his goats to graze, I decided I had to escape. I ran into the forest, but had no idea where I was going. There was nothing to eat, and at night I had to sleep in the trees to avoid the animals. After seven days, I found a homestead and was taken in by the Catholic sisters, where I met other girls who had been through the same thing. I started school in 2013. I have four brothers and four sisters, and none of them went to school; my parents never went to school, either. I hope to be a doctor and get a job to support my family, even though my father is still angry with me for leaving my husband – he had to return all the cows he’d been given as my dowry.   Courtesy of The Guardian "," In 2016, the estimates of modern slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for approximately 13.6 percent of the world's total enslaved population. As evident from surveys conducted in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia by Walk Free Foundation, slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa takes the form of forced labour and forced marriage. In Ghana, survey results suggest that there are an estimated 103,300 people enslaved in that country, of which 85 percent are in forced labour, and 15 percent are in forced marriage. For forced labour, the main industries of concern are farming and fishing, retail sales and then manual labour and factory work. In Nigeria, survey results suggest that forced labour is predominantly within the domestic sector, although it was impossible to survey in three regions due to high conflict. In South Africa, the industries most reported in the survey include the commercial sex industry, manual labour industries such as construction, manufacturing and factory work, and drug trafficking.

Archana,2017 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Sexual exploitation,India (slavery location),"I was only 14 when I was drugged and sold into a child sex ring. After I was rescued, I wanted justice. The trial went on for years. I was on the stand every day for seven months. They had 20 lawyers trying their best to make it seem like I lied. Midway through the trial, I was kidnapped by some of my attackers. I was rescued and continued with the court case. In the end all 20 were convicted and some of the men got two life sentences for what they had done to me.   As told to The Guardian"," Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India.

Carla,2017 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Honduras (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Honduras (slavery location),"My mum used to have a tortilla shop, but when she got arthritis I quit school and became a cook at a small restaurant in San Pedro Sula to support my family. I was 15. I worked 12-hour shifts and finished every day at 6pm, the same time that the gang curfew in our city came into effect. There are two main gangs in the area, and anyone on the streets after the curfew becomes a target. Every day I thought might be my last. One evening, my co-worker and I were walking to the bus stop when three gang members stopped and said we’d have to sell sex and drugs for them. “We’re not asking you,” they said. “We’re giving you an order.” They let us go, but I was terrified. The next night after work, they were there, waiting for us. “Time’s up,” they said, and they forced us into a car at gunpoint. We drove to a poor neighbourhood and stopped at a wooden house with a tin roof. There was a room that had a hole in the floor, and they pushed us into it and locked us in. When they finally opened the door again, a policeman was standing over us. We thought we were saved. Then he turned to the gang members and said: “It’s good you finally got some new girls. Let me try them first.” He was the first person to rape us. Then the gang members raped us. In the morning, men paid to have sex with us; and every night the gang would tie us up, cover our eyes and separate us. Then we’d be driven to different street corners to sell cocaine, and one of the guys would stand behind us with a gun, collecting the cash. They gave us no food, no water. They said we didn’t deserve it, that we had no rights. When I begged for a sip of water, one of them told me to drink my own urine.  Eventually, a client helped me escape. I told him I was very weak and was being held there against my will. He came back the following evening, put me in a taxi to the bus station, and paid for my ticket to the Mexican border. Now I’m applying for refugee status to stay here in Mexico.  "," Honduras is a source and transit country for women and children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. Those targeted are usually lured by false job offers from rural areas to urban, tourist centres. Honduran women and children are trafficked to Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, Belize, and the United States for commercial sexual exploitation. Most foreign victims of commercial sexual exploitation in Honduras are from neighboring countries; some are economic migrants victimized en route to the United States. Additional trafficking concerns include reports of child sex tourism in the Bay Islands, and some criminal gangs’ forcing children to conduct street crime. Carla was 15 when she was forced to leave school after her mother became ill. One evening on her way home from work Carla was forced into a car at gunpoint by a gang.

Crystal,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United States (slavery location),"I feel cold metal on my wrists. I hear the click of the handcuffs. I see my hysterical toddler son being put into a police car and I wish I could say that the rest is a blur. As the police search me I feel terrified and alone. I know that I have drugs in my pocket and that I am going to jail. What I do not know is where they are taking my little boy who has autism, cannot communicate and has not left my side since the day he was born. As the Guardian found when it interviewed me for a video investigation on human trafficking in San Diego – leaving the life is by no stretch an easy task. Oftentimes victims never have the chance to make it as a survivor; they die trying. The degree of failure that I felt on that day is indescribable. Up to that point, because of my exploitation and drug use, my life had been a barrage of failures. This time was different, though. This time I not only failed myself, I failed my son as well. Not every sad story has a tragic ending. Looking at the statistics, you might think I should be dead. My sad story includes a beginning that was riddled with family dysfunction including domestic violence, neglect, sexual abuse and exploitation. This traumatic upbringing was followed by drug abuse and forced prostitution. And yet here I am today, a sober, emancipated, successful and happy woman. Years of childhood sexual abuse were, for me, the impetus to a hypersexuality during my adolescence. That set the stage for my many years of human trafficking, defined as forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation and prostitution. Human trafficking is defined as the exchange of money for services that have been obtained by force, fraud or coercion. I firmly believe that one cannot separate human trafficking from prostitution, CSEC (the commercial sexual exploitation of children) and the equally important issue of labor trafficking. A perfect example of this is the fact that my second husband was my first trafficker, forcing me to have sex with other females for money. He also used my addiction as a tool of manipulation to ensure complete control over me and make sure that I did not leave. This lasted eight years. Once I escaped my second husband, I soon found that I was no farther from the life without him than I was when I was with him. Traffickers can sense when someone is vulnerable and I was no exception. I went back and forth, sometimes under the control of a pimp and many times engaging in prostitution just to survive. Although I did not know it, I never even had a choice. It would be impossible to count how many times I was raped, assaulted, held hostage and almost died. I have PTSD and major anxiety as a result. Fortunately, today I have a much different story. One that is full of hope and potential. After the loss of my son and the consequences of my arrest, I had two choices: either let my son disappear into the system or fight like hell to get him back and give him the life that we both deserved. In fall of 2011 I enrolled in San Diego City College as a re-entry student. At this point in my life I was a 35-year-old single parent with absolutely no job skills and no work experience to speak of. It was a humbling process to say the least, and challenging as well. Is there a solution? When you are talking about an illicit industry as large as human trafficking, one has to acknowledge that there is no one solution to solve this horrific phenomenon. From what I have learned in my many years as an activist fighting human trafficking, I believe that the Nordic Model is one of our best prospects. The Nordic Model criminalizes demand (the buyer and the pimp) for commercial sex, while decriminalizing individuals in prostitution and providing them with support services. Today, these services are scarce and make it almost impossible to convince a victim that there is something after “the life”. We are working to achieve this level of care in San Diego, but have not yet succeeded. According to a study from Point Loma Nazarene University and University of San Diego, we have 28 beds and an estimated three to 8,000 victims. This is not the picture that saves lives; it is one that takes away almost all of the hope of transitioning from victim to survivor. On 11 January 2016 I attended my first course at Point Loma Nazarene University. In 2015 the university established the Beauty for Ashes Scholarship Fund, a scholarship for victims of human trafficking. I decided to take a chance and apply, and soon after I became the first recipient of the new scholarship. As far as I know, this is the only scholarship of its kind that is specifically for sex trafficking survivors. I am grateful to say that after 14 months, I was granted custody of my son and he is a flourishing nine-year-old boy with the most amazing personality and he is resilient as well. I am not going to lie: raising a child with autism has been one of my biggest challenges. However, it has also been the biggest blessing of my life. He and I are best friends and have a bond that was not altered by the year that we were separated. Instead, because of the intervention we received from child welfare we are so much stronger and I have a significantly enhanced awareness of the degree of change that the human spirit is capable of. Both gifts that cannot be bought. I am the exception to the rule. I am one of a handful of victims that has survived to lead a different life. Now, I am determined to be part of solution: to raise awareness and to agitate for a changes in policy and the law. I hope you will lend me your encouragement.   As written for the Guardian"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Crystal grew up in a dysfunctional and abusive household. Having been sexually assaulted from a young age, Crystal points to her childhood experiences as the source of her vulnerability. It was as an adult that Crystal was trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation by her second husband who exploited her drug addictions and forced her to sleep with other women for money. Though she was able to escape her husband, the cycle of trafficking continued. It was after her arrest and the subsequent loss of her son to child services that Crystal was able to break the cycle and escape, going back to school and regaining custody of her son."
Czar,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Philippines (trafficked from),Australia (slavery location),"I’ve been boxing since I was 15. My dad died when I was young and my mum worked as a cleaner in the city, so we all had to help out putting food on the table. My mum always worried I’d get hurt, but I knew boxing paid well, and I loved it. I finished high school and decided to go pro. Soon, people started saying I was good enough to box in Australia. Then I met a Filipino man who said I could make A$200 (£122) a round in Australia. He gave me all the promises: I could support my family; I’d get an extendable visa; the money would be great. That sounded good, because my son had just turned two. I flew to Sydney with four other boxers. The first day there was a huge celebration for us with the man’s family, his son’s family and his daughter’s family. Then, out of nowhere, they made us hand over our passports and introduced us to our “duties”. I was told I was going to be the dishwasher and the others cleaners. We were going to box in the day and clean up after the three families in the morning and evening. They showed us our “room”. It was the garage. There were three bunk beds and no heating, and it was the start of winter. I wondered what was going on, but I couldn’t speak English too well and knew nothing about Australia. I had no money and no passport. We boxed and worked, but didn’t get paid, so I couldn’t send any money home. My partner ended up having to get a job and we broke up as a result. Eventually, after six months, I got my first fight. I was paid A$3,000, but he deducted all my expenses, visa and plane tickets, and I was left with $100. Finally, we decided to go to the police. We were very lucky that they helped us out. Now I live in Melbourne, and I make good money to send home. My son is turning nine soon, and I want to bring him here. Australia gave me another chance in life, and I’m grateful for that.   As told to Carla Kweifio-Okai for the Guardian"," Australia is a destination country for women from Southeast Asia, South Korea, Taiwan, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and reportedly Eastern Europe trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Some men and women from several Pacific islands, India, the PRC, South Korea, the Philippines, and Ireland are fraudulently recruited to work temporarily in Australia, but subsequently are subjected to conditions of forced labour, including confiscation of travel documents, confinement, and threats of serious harm. Some indigenous teenage girls are subjected to forced prostitution at rural truck stops. Czar flew to Sydney from the Philippines on the promise of a successful boxing career. However, upon arrival Czar was forced to hand over his passport and was told he would be working as a cleaner in the mornings and evenings. Czar's work as a cleaner went unpaid and when he did box, his earnings were deducted for visa and travel expenses. Eventually Czar and the other boxers being exploited went to the police who helped them escape."

I was sent to Qatar, but the family were cheating me, paying me less than agreed in my contract and refusing to give me a day off. I called the agency in the Philippines for help, but they never answered. I had to send money back home to pay for food, school fees and medicine. I fought with my employer about my salary, but he would say: “Your contract is just a piece of paper.” A year passed. Finally, they said they’d let me go home if I went to work for one of their sisters, who lived in London. My employer flew with me, and when we reached Heathrow, the immigration officer just asked my employer what I’d be doing and let us through. The sister lived in a flat near Harrods. I had to work all the time, without a day off, and I slept on the floor by her bed. She’d shout at me, saying I was stupid or calling me a “dog” in Arabic. I was rarely allowed outside the house, and only with her. I was given just a piece of bread and cup of tea for the whole day. I became emaciated. I felt like a slave, like I was in prison. I wanted to run away, but they had my passport.  I had my phone, so I was able to get on Facebook, and a friend referred me to a federation of Filipino workers in London. One morning, after my employer went for a nap, I grabbed my phone, found the keys to the door and ran. I hid inside a nearby church and phoned the federation.

Mai,2017 (Narrative date),Children,Vietnam (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I was a good student. But my parents could no longer afford to send me to school, so they put me to work in the fields instead. One day I got chatting to a guy on Facebook. He said he was a police officer and that he could find me better paid work in China. I went to meet him, but a group of guys bundled me into a truck and drove into China. When we stopped, I ran for it. After a couple of days, some women took me to the local police and I was able to come back to Vietnam.   As told to the Guardian"," The internal migration of Chinese people seeking work has created an opportunity for human traffickers in China. Moreover the gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them. The prevalence of poverty in China makes the poor more vulnerable to enslavement. With the National Bureau of Statistics estimating that 70,170,000 are still living in poverty, people are more desperate and thus more likely to be receptive to fraudulent job offers.  Mai, 16, was trafficked from Vietnam into China to be sold as a child bride."
Mario,2017 (Narrative date),Children Forced labour,Forced labour,Peru (slavery location),"I was living with my aunt in Cusco when a school friend introduced me to Señor Carlos. He’d worked with him in the gold mines and said he was trustworthy. He said I could make good money fast and the work wasn’t that hard, all I needed to bring was my birth certificate. I packed a small bag and left. I was 16. We went to Puerto Maldonado, then left for La Pampa. To get good land and good gold, you need to try different sites, so that’s what we did. We worked from 5am to midnight and would eat while we worked. My pay was 1,500 soles (£372) a month, but I was new to the job and didn’t know where or how to keep my money safe, because miners are always drunk, and keeping money or gold around is dangerous. You can get killed if someone thinks you robbed them. Señor Carlos offered to keep my salary for me, and would give me 100 or 200 soles to buy clothes or shoes for work. I stayed for a year doing different jobs. At first, we’d get 20 or 30 grams a shift, but then they bought two motors and the shifts changed. I started working 24 hours straight and was getting tired and sick all the time, but they didn’t let us take any days off. People were dying inside the mines, and their bodies would just be taken away and dumped outside. No one said anything about it, and nobody asked. One day, I saw a nice guy I knew from the mine leaving with Señor Carlos. The next day, the guy was dead. I was terrified. I asked Señor Carlos for all my cash at the end of my shift, but he refused, and said he wouldn’t give me my documents back, either. Then he beat me up and threatened to kill me. He drove me out to the middle of the jungle and dumped me in between the mine and the highway. Even now, all these years later, I’m terrified he’ll find me. These days I drive a motor taxi. It doesn’t pay great, but it lets me rent a room all to myself. If I could choose anything, I’d study to be a veterinarian. I like animals a lot, they’re kinder than humans.   As told to the Guardian"," Peruvian men, women, and children are exploited in forced labor in the country, principally in illegal and legal gold mining and related services, logging, agriculture, brick-making, unregistered factories, organized street begging, and domestic service. Peruvians working in artisanal gold mines and nearby makeshift camps that provide services to miners are subjected to forced labor, including through deceptive recruitment, debt bondage, restricted freedom of movement, withholding of or non-payment of wages, and threats and use of physical violence.  Mario was 16 years old when he went to work in a mine. Working long hours with no breaks, Mario's employer offered to keep his money safe, giving him an allowance from it to buy shoes and clothes. People became ill and were dying in the mines but weren't allowed days off. When Mario asked his employer for his money back he refused, beat Mario up and threatened to kill him, leaving him in the middle of the jungle."

My father is always drunk and doesn’t have a job, so my mother has to work. She works in construction, carrying bricks all day long. I thought I should help her, and one day a friend told me I could get a job at a restaurant in another part of Kathmandu. When I got there, I was offered work as a waitress. The restaurant wasn’t nice – it was dark with lots of flashing lights. I was afraid, but they said I shouldn’t worry, because I wouldn’t have to do anything I didn’t like. But this wasn’t true. The clients arrived and the boss told me I had to be kind to them. Later, they told me my clothes weren’t good enough for this job, and they forced me to put on provocative clothes and then forced me to dance naked. I had to let them touch me. At first I told my mum that I was going to school, because they let me go home in the evening. But then one day everything changed: they told me I couldn’t leave and they forced me into prostitution. My mother got very worried that I had been trafficked, and started looking for me. Finally, somebody told her about an NGO, Maiti Nepal, that helps victims of trafficking. She went to see them and they used their contacts to help find me. I was finally able to go home, and now I am studying at a school for trafficking survivors. In my class, all of the girls have been through similar experiences. One girl was sent to India and forced into prostitution when she was just 11; others lost their organs after traffickers took their kidneys. I found out that the men at the restaurant had planned to sell me to a brothel in India. I was so lucky that my mother found me. If not, I don’t know where I would be now.   As told to the Guardian."," Within Nepal, bonded labour exists in agriculture, brick kilns, the stone-breaking industry, and domestic work. Sex trafficking of Nepali women and girls increasingly takes place in private apartments, rented rooms, guesthouses, and restaurants. Nepali and Indian children are subjected to forced labour in the country, especially in domestic work, brick kilns, and the embroidered textile, or zari, industry. Under false promises of education and work opportunities, Nepali parents give their children to brokers who instead take them to frequently unregistered children’s homes in urban locations, where they are forced to pretend to be orphans to garner donations from tourists and volunteers; some of the children are also forced to beg on the street. Neeta went to find work as a waitress to help her family. Upon arrival at the restaurant Neeta was forced to put on provocative clothes and dance naked for customers. One day she was told she was no longer allowed to leave and was forced into prostitution. Neeta was able to escape when her mother sought out the help of an NGO to find her."
Nelson,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Brazil (trafficked from),Brazil (slavery location),""," Brazil is a source country for men and boys trafficked internally for forced labor which accounts for most instances of modern slavery in Brazil. It is particularly prevalent in manual labour sectors such as construction, manufacturing, factory and domestic work and occurs in rural and urban areas, mainly through debt bondage schemes. In rural areas workers are immobilised in estates until they can pay off debts often fraudulently incurred; their identity documents and work permits are frequently retained; they are often physically threatened and punished by armed guards and some have been killed while attempting to flee. Debt bondage involves abusive labour contracting schemes operated by contractors known locally as empreiteiros or gatos, often engaged in other types of seasonal labour contracts.    Nelson, 46, was trapped with his family in forced labour on a coffee farm in Brazil. "

Made up of both Russian and foreign workers, particularly from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, these people are enslaved in the agricultural and construction sectors, in factories, private homes, forestry, automotive and fishing industries. Russia also stands as the second largest migrant receiving country in the world, and remains one of the top 5 destinations for Ukrainians seeking work. These migrant workers often rely on underground networks and intermediaries, not knowing exactly what work they are committing to. Increased unemployment, poverty and demands for cheap labour among Russian citizens, along with the flow of cross-border migration has created new pockets of vulnerability and opportunities for labour exploitation in the country.    Oksana, 46, was trafficked from Ukraine into forced labour in Russia "

Said and Yarg,2017 (Narrative date),Children,2011,Mauritania,""," There are an estimated 43,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Mauritania, including up to 20,000 in forced labour. Slavery is entrenched in Mauritanian society, with slave status deeply rooted in social caste and being inherited from generation to generation. Of those in forced labour, Walk Free survey results estimate approximately 42 percent were exploited for domestic work. Forced labour in the domestic sector commonly includes women performing domestic chores, such as fetching water, gathering firewood, preparing food, pounding millet and caring for their master's children. Men and boys enslaved in the domestic sector typically herd animals (camels, cows, goats) or are forced to work in the fields.    Said Ould Salem, now 16, and his brother Yarg, 13, were born into slavery to the wealthy El Hassine family in Mauritania, having inherited the slave status from their mother. They worked all days from a very early age whilst their master’s children went to school and played football. The boys managed to escape in April 2011 thanks to the help of SOS-Esclaves. Later, with the help of Anti-Slavery International, their master became the first slave-owner ever prosecuted for slavery in Mauritania’s history. However, he was released on bail until the appeal.    The boys waited for the appeal for nearly five years. With Anti-Slavery’s support, their case was taken by Minority Rights Group International (MRG) to an African Union court in 2016, prompting a response from Mauritanian authorities and organising the appeal hearing in November 2016. The Court of Appeal increased the level of compensation awarded to the boys. However, their former slave owner’s sentence has remained unchanged, requiring him to serve only two years, when the law requires 5-10 years for the crime of slavery. The boys’ lawyers will appeal the sentence to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Said and Yarg are both in secondary school and respectively dream of becoming a human rights defender and a lawyer. "

Government oppression in the country prompts many to flee the country in ways that make them vulnerable to human trafficking in destination countries, especially China. Within North Korea, forced labour is part of an established system of political repression. The government subjects its nationals to forced labour through mass mobilisations and in North Korean prison camps. There are an estimated 80 000 to 120 000 prisoners being held in political prison camps in remote areas of the country.  Here men, women and children are subjected to unhygienic living conditions, beatings, torture, rape, lack of medical care and insufficient food. Many do not survive and furnaces and mass graves are used to dispose the bodies of those who die.    Young Soon, along with her family, was forced into an internment camp in North Korea as a political prisoner. Forced to live in a cramped hut and fed only gruel, Young Soon worked long hours in a corn field. All members of her family either died of malnutrition or were killed.

Yum,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Thailand (slavery location) Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),""," Men, women and children are victims of human trafficking for forced labour in the Thai fishing industry. Enslaved people are subjected to physical abuse, excessive and inhumane working hours, sleep and food deprivation, forced use of methamphetamines and long trips at sea confined to the vessel. Due to the fishing industry relying on trans-shipments at sea to reduce expenditure, some find themselves trapped on long-haul trawlers for years at a time. This makes the monitoring of enslaves labour on fishing vessels costly and difficult. The Thai Government has faced severe pressure to tackle forced labour specifically in the fishing sector, with the European Commission threatening a trade ban in 2015 for not taking sufficient measures to combat illegal and unregulated fishing that would cause the loss of up to US$1.4million a year in seafood exports. As a result the Government have reportedly accelerated efforts to combat labour exploitation, however despite this most workers in the Thai fishing sectors remain unregistered.    Yum was in Cambodia looking for work when he decided to travel with friends to Thailand. On the way, they were met by a man who offered them work on his farm, which they accepted. They were forced to work long hours with no wages. After a month, the farmer fled and Yum was offered work on a construction site in Thailand. However, in Thailand Yum arrived not at a construction site but a sea port. It was only after days on a fishing vessel that he was told he had been sold. Subjected to months at sea with poor nutrition and daily beatings, Yum was finally able to escape one the boat reached Indonesian waters. "
Park Ji-hyun,2015 (Narrative date),Prison labour Forced marriage Forced labour,China (slavery location) North Korea (trafficked from) Forced marriage Forced labour,North Korea (slavery location),"A lot of people died between 1996 and 1998.  The train station platforms were full of dead bodies. I remember witnessing a scene outside the train station,  a man was carrying a young child on his back.  He was holding his older son’s hand and carrying the younger one on his back. A soldier gave him a piece of bread. He broke the piece of bread into two pieces.  He gave a piece to his older son and tried to give the other one to his younger son. But the piece of bread fell on the ground.  As he tried to bend down to pick up the bread, he realized the child was dead. He was dead from hunger.  Every morning, before going out to work, I would prepare a bowl of rice and put a blanket over it to keep it warm.  I would ask my father to have the rice for his lunch. I would leave for work at 5 in the morning and when I got home in the evening, the bowl of rice would still be there, untouched. I’d ask my father why he didn’t have any of it, and he’d say ‘How can I bring myself to eat anything, when you’re out shivering in the cold?’ He’d go the whole day not eating anything and share the rice with me when I got home.   As my father’s condition grew worse, he wasn’t able to speak anymore. He could only gesture with his hands, telling me to go, to leave [North Korea]. My father kept gesturing to me to go. I couldn’t be there for him when he passed away. I left him behind in that cold room. I left him a bowl of rice and a change of clothes. I left North Korea like that. I wasn’t by my father’s side when he passed away. Like a selfish child I left just to save my own skin.   We’d been in China about two weeks, when the people we were staying with said to me, if I wanted to ensure my family’s wellbeing, I had to marry a Chinese man. My family would live on the money they got from selling me. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The thought of marrying a foreigner on foreign soil hadn’t even occurred to me. When I said I couldn’t, they told me they would get my family deported.  So, I agreed to go. I was at this other house for over a month. People would come to take a look at me. All sorts of people came, from children to the elderly. There were disabled people too.  They would come and haggle over my price. It was no different from an animal being sold in the marketplace. I was eventually sold for 5000 yuan, which would be around £500 here in the UK.   When you get sold off, the person who bought you will say, ‘I’ve paid for you, so now you must do whatever I tell you to do. If you disobey in the slightest, I could report you. Even if I killed you, no one’s going to say anything, and no one will know what happened to you’.  That’s how they intimidate and threaten North Koreans into forced marriage.   When I first discovered I was pregnant, I felt helpless and alone. Life was hard enough as it was, I couldn’t imagine bringing a child into this difficult situation. The village had a guard post up on a hill. The person in charge of the guard post told me I could stay there [while pregnant] if I wanted. I missed my mother, and I missed my sister so much.  After suffering alone in that room for 11 hours, I gave birth to my son. Nobody came to check on us. I decided to name my son myself. For him to make it in this hostile world he needed to grow up strong and hardy. So I named him Chol, which means iron.   [After 6 years in China Ji-hyun was reported to the authorities]  My son and his father came with me as far as the police station, and then we got separated. I didn’t get the chance to say anything to my son. I couldn’t tell him I’d be back, and I didn’t even get to hold his hand.   [Ji-hyun was sent back to North Korea and placed in a correctional facility]  Guards are called ‘teachers’ there. If the teacher is in a good mood, he lets us go and use the toilet. I found myself really having to go, and I rushed to the toilet without asking for permission. I was punished for that. I was instructed to unclog and clean the toilet with my bare hands. If you got caught trying to wash your sanitary towel, you were ordered to wear it on your head, dripping blood and all, and beg for forgiveness.   From here, those caught defecting to South Korea get sent to political prison camps, and don’t ever get released. While other who left simply for economic reasons get sent to labour camps.   Our working day began at 4.30 in the morning, before we could have anything to eat. In the summer, when the days are longer, we would work until 8 or 9 in the evening. We could only stop working when it got pitch dark. And the day doesn’t end there. After eating we had to reflect on our day’s performance, recite the Party’s principles, and learn songs. By then it’d be close to midnight. We were worked harder than animals.   We went to a valley surrounded by mountains in Gudok, Ranam Distict. We had to clear the mountainside to create terraced fields. We cleared the land with our bare hands. Four women had to pull and oxcart, two in the front and two in the back. Carrying a ton of soil in the cart. We couldn’t do this at a walking pace either. We had to run. In July, when we harvested potatoes, the very small ones would get eaten raw on the spot, with dirt still on them. Really, it was unspeakably bad. You could say the whole of North Korea is one big prison. The people are all hungry. And now, there aren’t even rats, snakes or wild plants left for them to eat.   [Ji-hyun contracted tetanus in her leg. Her condition worsened until she was unable to work, or even walk. The authorities discharged her from the labour camp. Now back in her hometown, Ji-hyun was sick, homeless and alone]  I prayed and prayed. Even when I was in pain, all I could think about was seeing my son again. And then at the end of that month, in late October, I got traffickers to take me to China. It was the only option I had, when I couldn’t even walk properly. I couldn’t tell them about my leg though. Again, I was being trafficked to China.   [back in China, one year after being expelled, Ji-hyun was determined to be reunited with her little boy.]  I told the traffickers about my son, and thankfully, they understood and were sympathetic. They said I could phone him. So I dialed the number I knew from memory and asked for my son. I asked to speak to him, and he came to the phone only to hang up on me. I called again the next day, and he hung up on me again. I kept calling and telling him I was his mother. Eventually, after a long pause, he say “Mummy…’ and started crying before hanging up again.  He was told that his mother had abandoned him and that she would never come back. I could not believe my eyes when I first saw him. His neck was covered with black dirt, his skin was completely flaking. I was so shocked.  I asked him what happened.  When autumn came, he was told that if he wanted to eat, he had to go out and bring back grains of rice; he would have to pick them up from the ground. He told me that his meals consisted of plain rice and soya sauce, nothing else. I had believed that at least in China, the child would not starve. But in fact his life was worse than the starving, begging children in North Korea.   It wasn’t very safe for us to remain in China, so I arranged for us to leave China for Mongolia. There were nine of us headed for Mongolia, and we had to cross the border on foot. My son was still very young. There were wire fences, two on the China side and then another on the Mongolia side. The two on the China side were very high while the one in Mongolia was quite low. We had to climb over them without getting caught by the border guards who were patrolling. Everyone made it over the fences except for me and my son. I thought I saw Chinese police cars driving up to where we were. If I got caught again, I would be sent back to North Korea. I would lose my son again. I could see somebody in the distance running towards us. I thought it was the Chinese police officer and that it was all over. He grabbed my son and put him on his shoulders, took my hand and we started running. He cut the wires for us and that is how we finally managed to get into Mongolia. Only after we reached Mongolia, I realized that the stranger who saved our lives was also a man who’d previously bought us food.  [Ji-hyun fell in love with the man who saved her and her son at the Mongolia border. Now the couple live in Manchester, UK with their three children]   My first son found a father. He looks after my first son like his own child and for that I am grateful forever. In fact we haven’t had an official wedding as of yet. My daughter is 5 years old. She too asks about our wedding. She says she wants to be the flower girl and scatter petals down the aisle. I told her the wedding will be really soon.     Courtesy of Amnesty International UK "," The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) is a source country for men, women and children who are subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.

Mohammed,2017 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,"",Pakistan (slavery location),""," It is estimated that there are over 2 million people are living in conditions of modern slavery in Pakistan. Debt bondage constitutes the most prevalent form of slavery, being found in industries such as brick making, agriculture, carpet weaving and fishing. Brick-kilns are located on the outskirts of most major towns and cities in Pakistan and operate almost exclusively on the basis of debt bondage. Male heads of families receive advances which bond them and their entire families to owners of brick-kilns. Once bonded, the laborers are forced to live and work at the brick-kiln site. While all members of the family are expected to work, the minimal wages paid are given only to the male head of the family. The pay structure is such that basic necessities are not covered by the wages, forcing workers to take out further loans and increase their debt.  Mohammed and his family were searching for a source of income when they found work in a brick kiln. Though they did not take an advance, Mohammed was forced to take out a loan with the kiln owners in order to pay for expenses, leading him and his family to be trapped in debt bondage. "

Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking.  Rosa was a struggling young single mother when two people she had recently met showed up unannounced on her doorstep, forced their way into her apartment and turned her life in to a nightmare.

Laura B,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"We went to Chicago and the whole drive, such a gentleman, nice guy you know. And never would I have guessed what was about to happen to me. I’m sitting in the car, he’s like “Can I use your phone really quick?” and you know, being really naïve and young, just passed him over what I would call my lifeline. Oh, here you go. Follow him inside, and um, it’s one of those brick duplex houses so it’s like probably four different little apartments in one house. I remember like going, in and like as we’re about to go downstairs he just turns and he punches me in my face. And I feel like the blood just running down. And he just looks at me and he’s like, “Don’t do anything stupid. Do whatever I tell you to do.” So I’m thinking in my head like, what the, what is going on? What is he talking about? We get down the stairs and it’s a bathroom. Pulls me into the bathroom he just starts beating me up, I mean you would have thought I had stole something from him, or I had did something the way he was beating me up. Like I was, like a man. And I’m sitting here thinking this is a grown man beating me up. Like it was nothing. And he tell me, “Do whatever I tell you, you know what this is”. And he’s basically telling me in the shortest amount of words, like, “you’re a thoroughbred”. From there I was thrown in a room with another girl. Concrete floors, real dark, it had like er little red lights, I remember these little red lights and it was like err bed built into the wall, but there’s blankets, and the other girl, she didn’t talk too much. I had kind of found out that she was from Florida. She was there from school and she met a guy. And that whole time was a blur being drugged, beat, raped, repeatedly. I mean, you would wake up and it was the next guy. And you would just pray the next guy was nice or pray that they would use a condom. I remember every time the door would open I would cringe. Because I didn’t know if I was going to get beat, I didn’t know if this next guy was going to be violent. I just, I never knew. You had not control of your life or what happens to you. You’re officially in ownership of someone else. You’re a product, you’re cattle. And what’s so crazy about it is he had my phone. He was using it to contact my, like when my parents would contact me, he would text as me. And if they would call too much he would give me the phone but before anytime he would give me the phone he would threaten me and say, “Remember, I know where your family lives and remember I will kill your nephew.”  You don’t know how many days you’ve been passed out because sometimes they would beat you so bad that you just go unconscious. Or you’d be so drugged up you don’t know. But I do remember one day they came in and he told me, “we’re leaving”. And I was like, okay yes, I’m gonna go home, this nightmare is over. I did what I was told, I get a chance to go home. And he said, “No, we’re going to South Dakota”. And we get to South Dakota and it’s like, how do I explain it? They would call it like a trap house. I mean, there’s drugs, there’s prostitution, there’s gambling, lottering, you name it. Everything is going on in this house. And the cycle begins all over again. One John after the next John after the next John, after the next John. And then when you think you’re done, then you have all the pimps and them, you know, they take their turn at you, and whoever else wants to take their turn at you. Women, it didn’t matter. And I kind of had become accustomed. I was smart, I never you know, back talked. They asked me to do something, I did it. I cooked, I cleaned, it was like slavery, like slave days. Just modern day, you never would think, driving past this house, there are girls in there that can’t leave against their will. We’d go to the grocery store, it’s be like a couple of us, we had to go to the grocery store across the street. We’d go in there and he would watch us. I mean literally watch us like a hawk. Get the groceries, come back. And then I was told, informed by the guy, we’re leaving here, and when we leave here everything’s staying here. We’re leaving your phone, we’re leaving, no one’s gonna know where you go. And I knew this was a turning point. If I didn’t do something, or if I didn’t try to run I could disappear and I wouldn’t be sitting here right now. I knew what disappear meant. I knew what that mean and I just didn’t feel like giving up yet. I’m not gonna lie, there was a lot of times where death seemed a lot better than what I was living. But I had become so numb to the, to the men beating, and just doing whatever they wanted with me. It didn’t bother me no more. And that’s a scary feeling when someone can come in there and punch you in your face, beat you, rape you, try to mutil…do all that stuff to you and it and it didn’t matter anymore. I didn’t care, I didn’t have like a, you lose your sense of worth. You don’t feel like a human being. And I think that’s the biggest thing with a lot of trafficking victims that people don’t understand.  In my head I had like this bright idea, and I made like some crazy story about my phone, needing a charger, and the gas stations right here. And like, he’s like, here’s the house. And there’s this big fence and then there’s a gas station. Get my purse and I know it was God, or I knew it was like some adrenaline because I get over a fence, and as athletic as I’ve ever been in my life, I have never been able to climb a fence. But that day, I got over that fence. My dad walked right on in and I just remember like getting up and like running to my dad. Like I can’t explain the feeling of seeing my dad. The next day my mom and dad took me to the ER and I just remember all the tests, and they’re looking over my body and everything that was wrong with me. Truth be said, I pray I can still have kids, after the damage that’s been done to me. But the physical damage doesn’t compare to the mental and emotional damage that I had for a good three months. May be three to five months. I didn’t want to leave the house for nothing. If my parents weren’t going, I wasn’t going. It was just real, how can I explain it? It was just like shell shock. Everything scared me. Everything frightened me. And then when we find out what they get charged for, there’s no kidnapping, there’s no sex trafficking. There’s none of that. It’s all drug. And they did their time served. They got their little slap on the wrist, got probation. And they were on about their lives. I had some who would come in and they’d be very timid and very concerned. Like looking at me like why do you have all these bruises? Why are you beat up? But in the end, they didn’t care. They were there for their fix. They were there to do what they wanted to do. And it’s funny because people always think “Oh, men who buy women are not these professional men”. And I’m telling people now, I had lawyers, doctors, you name it, there’s no discrimination. And it’s sad because, I had law enforcement. So when you think about the big picture, it’s just for anyone to give money to pay for sex is sick. If anybody can take anything away from my story is, it could happen to anybody. And hopefully it opens peoples eyes that they start to be more aware of their surroundings and what’s going on. You know, maybe it will make a mom check their daughters’ facebook more and stuff, you know. My biggest thing is I share my story for awareness so that there won’t be another me. Or I can save another girl’s life and give a mom hope. Give a dad hope that their child can make it through it.  "," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States.

Sakura,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Currently, I am a crime victim advocate here at the Sarpy County attorney’s office.  We keep them informed of what their rights are as a victim or witness but also where the case is going, what the movement is. We go on our first date and we go to a little concert in Lawrence. Then we go back and we sit in a park and we’re swinging and having a good time and then we go for a walk in the neighbourhood. I mean to me that’s like the perfect date. The next day he’s at my house and he’s moving in. and it was so weird because again, I’m two and half hours away from anybody I know. So this is all new to me. From there, he controlled everything I did, made sure that he knew where I was at all times. I could not move in that town without him knowing exactly where I was. Even when he would be out of town for work or whatever, he knew where I was at all times. So I know he enlisted some of his friends in his activity. He signed us up for some swingers club and we were gonna go to some convention or get together in Kansas City that they were having. I just remember leading up to that, we started frequenting the strip clubs. There were two of them in Topeka at the time and we went to one quite frequently and would spend like entire paychecks there. And buying lap dances from the dancers and he’d talk them into doing some extra things while they were dancing. Going to those, I don’t know what they’re called, sex shops. And I can remember going in the back of one, in particular. And they had these booths in a row where you could rent videos and watch it in there and do what you do.  But they had big windows so people could see in there and I can remember we had to have sex in there and allow other people to watch. Again, while this is all going on I’m thinking, this is horrible, I hate this, this is not me but I’m stuck. I don’t know where to go I don’t know how to get out. So you have to do with it because standing up to it, saying no, that just gets you beat. He knew where to hit and how to his so it wouldn’t be visible to my coworkers or to anybody else. And there’s a lot of ways that you can essentially torture someone without leaving a mark. He did a really good job of doing that. He had a gun in my apartment and I hated guns.  I just don’t feel comfortable around them and he would purposely take it out and clean it in front of me with it pointed, the barrel, right at me. He never directly threatened me with it but he made sure I knew that it was there. Having to have sex in these back rooms, whatever. Other people watching, whatever. And then it escalated to having to have sex with other people. And that was when the swingers thing came in.  Thankfully that didn’t happen too much, but once is too much. As you can tell just thinking about it, it’s hard because who does that to another human being? And all the time he’s telling me he loves me. Yet he’s doing all of these horrible things to me. I did not know what to do to get away. He was physically violent with me, stalking me. The sexual abuse I mean, I know the inside and outside of every strip club between Topeka and Independence, Missouri. And all of the sex shops all along the way. I would put my check in, he would take the money out. And then the only way I could get my money back to pay for rent was, we’d go to these sex shops, these strop clubs, we did the swingers thing, we called those 800 numbers or whatever those number are for phone sex. We were doing all of these things and I didn’t have a choice in this. You do it or you get beat. So you’ve got your force, you’ve got your fraud, you’ve got your coercion. And then of course the interstate because it was between Topeka and Independence, Missouri on Interstate 70. Again at that time I’m not thinking this is trafficking and this is really horrible, I’m just thinking this really kind of stinks but I’ll get through it. I literally had to essentially turn tricks to get my money back. I think the intrigue, or however you want to call it, is the same. You’re targeted. The person, they’re looking for targets.  They’re looking for that vulnerability.  I don’t consider it a weakness. I may have at one point considered that I had weaknesses, but I think they’re looking for that vulnerability. My trauma history created a huge vulnerability, whether I realized it or not. In my mind at that time, my only option for getting out of that situation would have been leaving my job, leaving my apartment and just leaving my possessions and just grabbing my cats and getting in my car and going. The thought of leaving my job, something I felt I worked so hard to prove to myself and to others that I can do this. And everything that I had, I had worked for. And it’s so difficult to walk away from that. I felt like I’m stuck.  In certain light I can see the scars from when I cut myself to get away because I didn’t know what else to do. But that was my main addiction, was cutting.  [one day Sakura was talking with her mother on the phone as they watched the events of 9/11 unfold] And we’re watching it together and we see the second plane hit and I realized at that point, I need to be with my family. I need to figure a way out of here. He had threatened, “If I can’t have you, nobody will”. So I was concerned for suicide as well as homicide. And he had the gun so I know he had the means. So we go to file a protection order and half way through the paperwork, I just remember looking at my mom and saying, “I just gotta let him go”. Me filing this, he’s gonna maybe try to fight it. He’s gonna be living half way across the United States. I just gotta let him go. And the whole time he was moving he called. I felt bad for him. Like this is my fault. And then he got to Florida and within about a couple of months I was able to finally just break it off. Emotionally break it off. The physical part was not a problem. But the emotional part, I had to do that and changed my number and haven’t heard from him since. [Sakura is asked if she ever wants the guy to be made accountable] Oh yeah. I do. But I can’t think of anything that the criminal justice system has to offer for me in this case, that any system honestly has to offer. I can’t think of anything that would make me feel better of anything like that. I would not go back for anything because those experiences have put me in this seat today. To where I can talk about the horrible things that human beings are doing to other human beings. And hopefully even one person is going to listen to my experience and believe me and realize yes, this is horrible, there’s something I can do in hopes that somebody else does not have to go through this. What I’m doing is not about me. It’s about my daughter and that generation. It’s about other thousands of women and children that are subjected to this every day. Even when I’m deeply saddened by some of the stuff I’ve experienced, and as much as it pains me to actually talk about my own personal experience, it’s given ne the energy to say stop. This has to end. We can’t expect to sustain ourselves as human beings I we are continuing to do this. This is some of the worst stuff that you can do to another person and it’s easily stopped. [Sakura is asked if she thinks any progress is being made] Yeah. I think we are because we’re talking about it. We’re sitting down right now, you and I are having this conversation about it. Something ten years ago, that would not have happened. You know, people are definitely becoming more aware. But again, so many people are so good at distancing themselves that think I don’t know anybody that does this. I don’t do it so it’s not about me. We distance ourselves from others and by doing that we’re going a huge disservice. And every single one of my friends that I have had deep conversations about this and other people that I have talked to, it’s amazing that as soon as people know that you are aware of what trafficking is and what it looks like and what’s happening and you are open about what you have learned, people will come out of the woodwork and want to ask you questions. And they’ll be like “Oh well so and so down the street…” It’s amazing by just becoming educated, how that opens up the door for conversations.   As told to documentary filmmakers at NET Nebraska","There are an estimated 57,700 people in modern slavery in the US according to GSI estimates. The US attracts migrants and refugees who are particularly at risk of vulnerability to human trafficking. Trafficking victims often responding to fraudulent offers of employment in the US migrate willingly and are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in industries such as forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Sakura was in sixth grade when she was first raped. Many more followed, bad relationships and alcoholism were the norm. When her job took her to Kansas, Sakura met a man she thought was perfect. They went on their first date and the next day he moved in. It was at this point he began controlling everything Sakura did."
Tikirit,2017 (Narrative date),Children,"",Niger (slavery location),"My master, a man called Amola Zono, lived in his family village of Toudoun Adaraoua. He was Hausa. I was his only wahaya and my clothes set me apart from his four legal wives. They dressed decently, while my clothes barely covered me. He used to come to me at night in secret for sex. My workload was heavy: fetching water for all the family; fetching water for livestock (over 100 cattle); hulling and pounding grain (millet and sorghum) for food and foodstuffs; providing firewood for the family; large preparations – the day before and on the days of community gatherings in the master’s fields during the rainy season (for 30 to 40 people); washing up; preparing the mistresses’ and the master’s beds; looking after the children and keeping the courtyard clean – these were my tasks until my master’s death. As told to Anti-Slavery International "," In 2016, the estimates of modern slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for approximately 13.6 percent of the world's total enslaved population. As evident from surveys conducted in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia by Walk Free Foundation, slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa takes the form of forced labour and forced marriage. In Nigeria, survey results suggest that forced labour is predominantly within the domestic sector, although it was impossible to survey in three regions due to high conflict. In Nigeria and Niger, the ‘Wahaya’ practice  continues to exist in which women and children are sold into sexual and domestic slavery as unofficial ‘fifth wives’. They are known as such because they are in addition to the four wives legally permitted in Niger and Nigeria. Tikirit Amoudar, 45 years old, describes how she was sold at aged 10 and remained as a ‘wahaya’ for 15 years."
Al,2016 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Guinea (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,France (slavery location),"I was like any ordinary young boy growing up. I loved to run around, laugh and play with my friends. My bare feet were a permanent shade of orange, coloured by the hours spent kicking a ball around on the dusty ground near my home. I grew up with my two younger sisters, my mother and my father, who at the time was head of a secret society. I was just a one-year old when he died but by the time I turned 15 I was put under lots of pressure to take on my father’s position. During this time, Sierra Leone had experienced a brutal civil war and fearing for my life and family, I was sent to Guinea. I was desperate to protect and provide for my mother and sisters but I was in a strange country and didn’t know who to turn to. It was here that I met a Frenchman who promised the world – the opportunity many young men and I in particular had dreamt of – the chance to play professional football. I began to trust this man but it was here my nightmare truly began.  I was taken to Paris on the promise that I would play for a European football team. From there though I was taken to London. It quickly became clear that something wasn’t right. I was taken to a hotel and left there, alone. Very soon, older men began to turn up and tried to get close to, then touch and then rape me. Scared and afraid I didn’t know what was happening, couldn’t speak English and had no one to turn to for help. I felt trapped. However, against all odds, and I still don’t know how, I managed to escape. I found someone who spoke my language and he paid for my bus ticket to the UK’s Home Office. They couldn’t verify my age, as I didn’t have any identification. I was put into a home in Chertsey in the South East of England and it was there that I started to play football. Amazingly a scout for Watford Football Club spotted me and I was signed to play for the team. I was able to help get them promoted to the Premier League and ended up playing in front of thousands of people at some of the most famous stadiums in the world. I realised how lucky I was to have got away. Sadly so many others in my position don’t. In countries all over the world, trafficking not only exists but is thriving. In West Africa, my story is not uncommon. Thousands of young boys, many aspiring to be footballers, are sold a dream, which ends in a nightmare. In fact I still hear stories like mine from back home. The truth is, slavery doesn’t just happen in far away countries. It happens in our cities, towns, and neighbourhoods. It is happening now and it has to stop. Its perpetrators need to be brought to justice…for me, for other victims, for you. Traffickers need to go to prison so they can’t continue their criminal activity. Football is my passion and it has given me everything I have. Most importantly it gave me freedom. What happened still affects my everyday life. I find it hard, for example, to trust football agents who claim to represent my best interests and I’ve struggled to make the most of my talents. It has sometimes impacted my ability to provide for my family in these latter days of my career. However, when I play football I still feel free. I find my confidence. I start to smile. I am now proud to now be an ambassador for Sport for Freedom, a charity that uses the positive power of sport to raise awareness about human trafficking and help rehabilitate its survivors. Just a week ago I spoke at Football for Freedom, an International U16’s Tournament hosted by our charity in partnership with the Premier League. It brings together young academy players from the UK as well as international teams. I shared the stage with Kevin Hyland, the UK’s fantastic Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner who has already achieved a great deal in his first year, and I was able to educate and tell my story to the young boys who are at the start of their footballing careers. I was also truly honoured to speak at a service to commemorate the work of William Wilberforce and the UK’s current fight against modern slavery. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, who has been an inspirational champion for this important cause, was also in attendance and spoke passionately about the need to combat trafficking and modern slavery. She spoke to me privately and thanked me for the work I am doing.  Being here today though and having the opportunity to share my story with all of you and meeting His Holiness is one of the most special moments of my life. I will continue to represent Sport for Freedom and use the power of sport to educate others about this awful crime. It is amazing to see how even an hour of sport or physical activity can bring some relief to survivors who have experienced real terror. It can help build trust, hope and confidence again. Sport can rebuild lives and it can bring communities together. That’s how I’ve chosen to help and I hope you can all find it in your hearts to do whatever you can. I’m confident that by working together we can help end human trafficking and modern day slavery.   As told to the Santa Marta Group Conference"," Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the most widespread for of modern slavery with an 84% of victims trafficked for this purpose. The majority of those trafficked for this purpose are women and young girls, thought men and boys are also trafficked for sexual exploitation. They often originate from Eastern Europe within the EU as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority of people being trafficked from Nigeria to various parts of Europe including Italy, France, Spain and the UK through an array of complex trafficking networks.  Al Bangura was born and raised in Sierra Leone but now lives in London with his wife and young children. Wanting to help support his family, Al travelled to Guinea where he was told by a man that he could play footbal in Paris. Al trusted this man, however on arrival in Paris, he was put in a room and subjected to sexual exploitation daily. He is now a professional footballer who has played for Watford Football Club in the UK’s Premier League."
Ana B,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"When I crossed the Mexico-U.S. border I thought I was going to be living a dream by being in a better country to raise my son. Unfortunately, we fell into the hands of bad people and everything changed. At first I didn’t mind working from sunrise to sunset picking fruit because I knew the money would come in handy. But when I was only able to keep $40 for a week’s worth of work, and went days without seeing my child, I was shattered. Not only was I working long hours, but my son and I were also confined to a small, dirty room. I would go nights without sleep protecting him from the roaches and mice that were in that room, too. I would beg the boss to let me go so that I could find a better place to live, but she always said I was never leaving. One day when the boss wasn’t home, I had the courage to walk out of the house and seek help. I realized I was in the middle of nowhere and would most likely never get away. However, two good Samaritans walking by asked if I needed help and I yelled YES! I told them I needed to get away with my son, but a few minutes later the boss showed up. She dragged me back to the house and threatened me. I thought our chance to escape had passed, and I feared what would happen to us, but the good Samaritans called the police. When they arrived to the house we were finally freed. The officer took us to a shelter and said everything was going to be okay. The next day I met Linda from Family Services. She explained she was going to help my son and me with anything that we needed. I told her I was scared for our lives and that I didn’t feel safe not knowing exactly where I was and what was going to happen. Her tone of voice and words of encouragement made me feel so comforted. She spoke Spanish just like us, and that was a huge relief. She asked a few questions and explained that I had been a victim of labor trafficking. I am really grateful for Linda and the other people from the different organizations that have been involved with my son and me in overcoming these difficult situations. Thanks to these programs I have the opportunity to incorporate myself into society and feel free. These programs give us the opportunity to have a better life, a roof over our heads and food on the table. Without all your help, I think we would still be stuck in the same situation, and forgotten. I am thankful to all who work to help and support people in need. I hope that by sharing my story, more people can learn about these programs and get out of their misery.   Courtesy of Family Services Supporting Tulare County  "," There are an estimated 57,700 people in modern slavery in the US according to GSI estimates.

Menuka,2014 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Nepal (trafficked from),Lebanon (slavery location),"I returned back from Lebanon after staying there for six years. In my neighbourhood there was a person whose son used to stay in Lebanon and I was told that he would send me the visa, that’s how I went there. I was told that I would get 10 thousand rupees for a month but after arriving there I found out that the salary was only 7 thousand rupees a month (100 US dollars). But they raised it and gave me 125 US dollar per month because my English was good. I went through India and I was alone. At that time I went there without even thinking about my life, my age, education. I didn’t know anything. I had never even been to Kathmandu at that time. But I gathered enough courage to go and work in that new unknown place. I was very much scared as I didn’t know what kind of place it was, who will come to pick me up, what work I have to do, how will I do the work! In other words I was totally in the dark. Though I didn’t have any skills I was quite confident, as I knew English Language and I also knew that people there would speak and understand English. Other than that I had no trainings or skills and even didn’t know what kind of domestic work I had to do there. I was thinking of going abroad for work, but I was not educated enough, that I why I took English language training for about a year. That helped me boost my confidence as I could understand and reply back in English. Even though I didn’t know any household work, I had that confidence. Once I reached Beirut airport, I had to give my passport to the airport officials. I didn’t know who, when and how the person will come there to pick me up, so I asked other girls who were also waiting like me. They told me that the airport officials will allow us to go only with our employer. All those girls were picked by their employers and at the end I was the only one left there. After that time, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know anyone there and I also didn’t have anybody’s number to make a phone call. Later, at around 10pm they called upon my name. I saw my employer who came to pick me up and I went to their home. I used to get rest for two hours after doing all household work. As they ate full meal once a day and ate leftovers for dinner I had to cook once a day. I also used to eat whatever was there and also used to make some food for me with cheese. They provided me everything, money to call home and things like body lotions, shampoo and other things for my own use. I used to ask for my salary at 5 or 6 month gap and I used to send it over my home, it was okay. After staying there for four years I told them I wanted to come home to see my family and they asked whether I want to take a holiday or leave the job. I told them I wanted to take a holiday, so they paid for my ticket. Later, they sent me in a good way. They bought gifts for me to take home. I still communicate with them through Facebook and phone. They are asking me whether I want to come back, they told me that if I decide to go there they won’t get another person. They have also told me that if I decide to go there they would pay for my passport and air ticket and other costs related to it. I am thinking about going back to Lebanon. If I go again, I will get a labour permit from the government and go from Nepal’s airport. I am completely sure that I would not have any problem. If I go again, I won’t go from India, as I did before I will go from here, my own country.   As told to Anti-Slavery International"," Lebanon is a destination for Asian and African women trafficked for the purpose of domestic servitude, and for women from Easter Europe for commercial sexual exploitation. There are estimated 200,000 migrant domestic workers in Lebanon and until 2012, Lebanon was the top country of destination for female migrant workers from Nepal.  Women who travel to Lebanon legally to work as household servants often find themselves in conditions of forced labour through the withholding of passports, non-payment of wages, restrictions on movement, threat and physical of sexual assault. Menuka was looking to support her family when she decided to travel from Nepal to Lebanon to find work. Upon arrival in Lebanon, Menuka’s passport was taken from her and she was taken to provide domestic work for a family. "
Michaela,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),"[My mother] made it clear from day one that I’d screwed up her life by being born. At five years old I walked into the bedroom…to show her a paint-by-number that I painted for my grandmother. She was with another man and [when she saw me] she went ballistic. She decided that I was a whore… and that I needed to be taught a lesson about what a whore is. She offered [her boyfriend] the opportunity to penetrate me and told him it was a punishment and to make it hurt. He was more than happy to accommodate. They decided [raping me] was a nice fringe benefit to their relationship and he continued for years with full knowledge of my mother. There was an emphasis on keeping this a secret. My mother made a point of showing me the county jail and said if I told anybody that’s where I would go…I was terrified of that jail so I kept it quiet. I was an accelerated student and hid my issues under the guise of intelligence. Until 6th grade I was a straight A student. In 6th grade puberty hit and I changed. The first time I was offered access to alcohol and drugs it occurred to me that I could do what I was doing at home to older boys and get beer and drugs…I started ditching class and it got out of control, but my father was on School Board so no one wanted to draw attention to what was going on. At the end of 9th grade my parents told me they were moving to a new house that didn’t have room for me and I would need to get out…I hitchhiked to Cincinnati to my best friend from 8th grade and I thought I could live with her…when I got there my friend’s parents realized that I was a runaway…they wanted nothing to do with [me]. They called DSS, the police, and I was terrified of police so I split. I spent all my money on pacman and space invaders and then realized I had no money for food and no place to stay and that is where the enormity of being homeless really hit. I thought I was slick and would be good at shop lifting, but got chased repeatedly from 7/11. So I started staking out café’s and wait until someone ordered a sandwich and I would snatch it and run into traffic…I slept in a cemetery because everyone there was dead and they weren’t bothered by my presence, plus the sprinklers went on and it was a way to get clean. One day I was in the mall and this gorgeous guy walks up to me. He looked like my teenage crush Lindsey Buckingham, the lead singer of Fleetwood Mac…He was very charming. He picked out that I was a homeless runaway, that somebody must have hurt me and he was very sympathetic…He told me he ran an entertainment agency and that I seemed intelligent and beautiful and smart…I jumped at the chance because I did want to get off the street and work. He said I could audition…I said ok, but I had one question, was this prostitution because I didn’t want to be a prostitute. He stood up indignantly and got mad and said he was wrong about me and I wasn’t professional or intelligent, that was a stupid question and the deal was off and he stormed off. I really wanted to work so I ran up to him and begged for another chance and made a deal that there would be no more questions…and he took me out to his car and made this big production about corporate espionage and so he blindfolded me and covered it with sunglasses and a hat. At this point of course my instincts were telling me this was wrong, but I was in the back of his car and didn’t know what to do…He said we were going downtown to his office building, except…we pulled up to a garage because I could hear the garage door going up…I knew something was wrong and could smell the musty basement smell. At that point I was sobbing and he spotted the tears and leveled me with a backhand and told me that professionals don’t cry and I was going to lose my chance at the job unless I stripped. So I did because I’d kind of gotten the point about who was in charge. I stripped and he told me to put my hands over my head and I could feel something wrapping around my wrists. I didn’t really understand what was happening and then what I was standing on gave out and I was hanging by my wrists, at which point it becomes really hard to breathe because all your weight falls on your diaphragm. I was reduced to panting like a dog, very focused on just trying to breathe. Then he raped me and hit me with some kind of whip hundreds of times and a kind of stick and he told me I could hang there until I died and he would throw my skinny ass into the Ohio river or I could go work for him…I agreed to work for him. That was where he explained that I was gong to work as a paid submissive. That sadist clients wanted what they viewed as a masochist, or painslut, that’s what I was going to do. We did a lot of sensory deprivation. He showed me his dungeon and we practiced endlessly on each pieces of equipment as to what it felt like and how much it hurt and how I was supported so response. We also worked on my cover story…if I was questioned I was to say this was all consensual. After about 5-6 weeks of intense torture and rape he thought my training was done and I could see clients. That’s how I got started in sex work. I was able to get out after three years because of a fluke. He was arrested on charged not related to me and I was able to get away. I escaped to Vegas and over time rebuilt my life. For quite a few years I compartmentalized everything that had happened. I got a job as a flight attendant. I got back into sex work in my forties because I had a series of major medical issues. The flight attendant position caused a series of blood clots in my legs and I lost my job over this and lost my health insurance and was out of work for months. I tried to avoid sex work by taking any job I could get, but I found that even working full time I had no food. I was stealing food out of Kroger if I wanted to eat. It came down to needing money this minute for rent, so I posted on backpage and started working as an escort, which was a very different scenario than the teenager coerced. As an escort I can screen my clients and control to some degree my environment...I advertise in various venue and work for myself as an independent. I continue to be a sex worker because of the economy. I don’t have high living standards…but I have not been able to pay me a job that enables me to live…I am no fan of sex work…I just need the money. Courtesy of Daily Kos"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. This survivor tells of how she ran away from an abusive household in ninth grade and became homeless. One day she was approached by a man at the mall who claimed to work for an entertainment industry and jumped at the chance to get off the street. This survivor was blindfolded, put in a car and taken to a location where she was stripped and raped. After five to six weeks of ‘training’ she was forced to provide sexual services. It was only after her trafficker was arrested on unrelated charges that she was able to escape, however continues to provide sex work due to economic need."
Mira,"",Domestic slavery,Nepal (trafficked from),Lebanon (slavery location),"My father died. My mother used to do everything at home. She was managing our home. She used to provide uniform, books, notebooks and everything for our school. This is how I managed to study up to lower secondary school but I failed in my school leaving certificate at 10th grade. Then I started to take care of cattle and household. My mother died 10 years ago. I decided to go abroad to work after she died. I had my brother-in-law, Giri. I told him that I wanted to go abroad for work. He told me to go to Lebanon. It was him who sent my bags and luggage to India. I thought he would take me directly from Delhi to Silgadhi but he kept me at his sister’s home for a day. He took me to the station at 5 in the evening. We got into the train at 9pm. In the train I could not sleep. I was anxious about what was going to happen next. My brother-in-law told me that there would be a direct flight from Delhi and that I would reach Lebanon at 10am. But the flight was not to Lebanon, there was transit in Abu Dhabi. I rested at Abu Dhabi airport and then went to Lebanon. When I reached the airport, they asked me for my passport. I gave my passport to the airport officials. After they took me to a big room but there were many women in that room. I wondered, why have they taken me here? Why are there so many people here? I was very afraid. I could not understand a word as I didn’t know the language and didn’t know how to communicate with them. Employers would come, call their employees’ names looking at the passports, and take the other women who were waiting to go to their homes. Everyone was gone. I was the last one to go. I was so afraid at that time. What will happen? What are they going to do to me? Why isn’t my employer here? I waited there for 9-10 hours. It was 8pm. My employer arrived and asked me if he was later. I replied that he was. I told him that I had waited for long enough. He said let’s go. I put my bags in the car. He took me to the agent’s office. It was completely dark by the time we reached the office. It was nine o ‘clock. He asked me what I wanted to work on. I had been told that I would work at a house. I came here to work at a house, I said. The agent told me, “not it’s not a household job”. Thee is an old lady and you have to look after her. Okay, I told him that it was fine. Then he took me to my employer’s home. What do I need to do here? I asked. And they said, “you have to look after this lady. She is mentally ill”. I was totally shocked. How would I look after her? At that moment, I thought, I am not going to stay in this place. I thought, if anybody could take me back to Nepal, I would rather work for them. I had no other option. Who would I ask for help? Where would I get support? Next day, they asked me to wake the lady up and help her take her shower. I couldn’t understand a single word nor could I carry her. I was in deep trouble. During my four years stay in Lebanon, one day this lady threw all her food in the toilet. Her daughter-in-law saw this, she said to me, “Mira, my mother-in-law has thrown her food in the toilet”, and asked me to take it out. She gave me gloves to wear and I had to clean that. When I was trying to clean the toilet, the old lady punched me very hard on my back. At that time, I felt that I had made a big mistake by taking the responsibility of this lady. I had never been beaten like that before. I felt very sad and it made me cry. Obviously if feels bad to be beaten by others for no reason, doesn’t it? As my employers were good and they were providing good food and clothes, I didn’t bother about what had happened to me. I was thinking of returning back home after two years. They would say, “you can return only after my mothers dies”. When is your mother going to die and when will I go home? I used to ask them. She could live for much longer! This is how I spent four years, hoping to be sent home soon. I got my remaining salary for one and a half year. He also gave me an additional 200 dollars for shopping. Then I got my bag, some clothes and other stuff. They left me at the airport and I came back to Nepal. After arriving here at home, I took a walk around the village, I saw everybody. Those sisters who are going to Lebanon should first learn the language before going there. After learning the language, you should learn how to operate things in the kitchen. Learn to wash clothes in the washing machine. It is better if they learn all these things before going.   As told to Anti-slavery International "," Lebanon is a destination for Asian and African women trafficked for the purpose of domestic servitude, and for women from Easter Europe for commercial sexual exploitation. There are estimated 200,000 migrant domestic workers in Lebanon and until 2012, Lebanon was the top country of destination for female migrant workers from Nepal.  Women who travel to Lebanon legally to work as household servants often find themselves in conditions of forced labour through the withholding of passports, non-payment of wages, restrictions on movement, threat and physical of sexual assault. Mira decided to look abroad for work after her mother died. Her brother-in-law told her she could do housework in Lebanon and arranged for her travel. However, arrival her passport was taken and upon meeting her employer she learned that she would not be going housework but caring for their mentally ill mother. Unprepared and untrained for such a job, Mira was told she couldn’t leave until her employer’s mother died. She was forced to work in Lebanon for four years before she was allowed the return to Nepal."
Manon,2014 (Narrative date),Children,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I am very lucky and I am very happy that today I am speaking in front of you because when I was just 6 years old I was used to work in Mica mine. Mica mine is very hazardous. More than 400 feet down you will have to go to collect the mica and you don’t know that you are. Make sure about your life because any time the mine will collapse on you, probability is high for that. So, in front of my eyes, one of my best friends I have seen to die. I can’t explain it in my own words that, how much painful that was for me. And this is very painful, painful for me to recall that. At that time where I was just 7 years old and mica is very hazardous. You will have many diseases related to your stomach, related to your lungs, and if you make any mistakes then you will cut your hands by the sharp mica. So still they are working, many children, and I was lucky that I was rescued from there by the BB activist Mr. Kailash Satyarthi. And then I took to Bal Ashram. This is a rehabilitation centre and I study there, and I learned there, culture activity, I learned there drama and I started my study from there. And I passed their senior high school and I got admission in to university. So, I want to say that the responsible person, they are spending their time to collecting their data and only they are working on paper. So, we have to do some practical work. Because time will not afford that child who is slave. One time and one second is important for that slave and for that child who is still working and who is bonded child labourer. So, we have to do some practically. Many international companies are making their money by using cheap labour, as me. They are earning many money, but they have to see that I am earning money this is, by using the child slavery so this is a very bad thing. So, we have to do practically to change society and we have to do something fast because the time is passing very quickly and that one minute, that one second is very important for that child who is working now. And one of my friends, this is very difficult and painful for me to recall that in front of my eyes my friend, got death there. When he was working inside the mine, suddenly the biggest stone and all the sand and mud collect on him and I was not able to see my friend, where is he? Because he was inside the mine and the big stone and the sand was over that. So, I don’t want this type of accident to be with another. Every man said that we are responsible, so we are sitting here so we have to take responsible that no child will be in slavery and no child will be child labour. And we have to eradicate the child slavery, child labour, and bonded child labour from all the world. Thanks.   This narrative was recorded at Trust Conference, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s flagship event.

The mica mining area of Jharkhand/Bihar in India comprises an estimated 300 rural villages, and child labour occurs in these remote villages, including collecting/mining mica and cobbing (hammering minerals other than mica from the mined rocks. It is estimated that approximately 20,000 children are currently working in the mica mines in India, with 90% of these working under illegal conditions of modern slavery. Manon was trafficked from Nepal to India at the age of 6 years old to work in the Mica mine. Forced to work in dangerous conditions, and to watch his best friend die, Manon was finally rescued two and a half years later."

Then the women took me into an empty room and one came behind me and pinned me to the floor by pressing my shoulders hard. Another held my left leg and a third held my right leg. At that point I started panicking and asked them to release me. They did not listen. My mother has disappeared and the only familiar face was that of my auntie who kept on telling me to lie down and be quiet. A very old lady came in sat in front of my opened legs and opened a piece of cloth. She took out a blade and started cutting me. The pain was excruciating. I started screaming. I tried with all my strength to free my legs but the two women holding me, held harder and harder and I kept screaming. The woman kept on cutting. I think I fainted at that point. I felt betrayed by my mother and did not want to talk to her. She told me that when I grew up I would be able to have children safely and my husband would love me. Since that day I had a lot of pain when I passed water and when I started having a period I would scream from the pain sometimes. I never felt anything when my husband came to my bed at night. I cleaned his house, cooked for him and he forced me to sleep with him all the time. It hurt a lot. I could not have children; it might have been a result of the cutting. My husband left me because he had the right to take another wife and because he said I brought him bad luck. I was at a really low point in my life, I had nobody.  I found out about Ashiana and arranged to meet a worker.  The worker I had was very kind and knew a lot about FGM, I felt like I could talk to her and didn’t have to explain myself.  I have received support for over a year now and feel much better about my life.  I have accessed health support and emotional support and am training to become a volunteer with Ashiana.  My aim is to raise awareness alongside the workers in the communities which are affected by FGM.  I hope that I can help other girls and women so that they don’t have to go through what I have been through.   Narrative provided by ASHIANA"," Female genital mutilation (FGM) remains widespread across many developing countries and has affected an estimated 140 million girls across Africa and parts of the Middle East and Asia. In Sierra Leone it is considered a traditional practice as part of initiation in to secret women’s societies known as Bondo, with nine out of ten women and girls having been cut. Membership marks a girls’ transition into womanhood and they receive training in their roles as wives and mothers. While FGM is therefore seen as a societal norm, it has internationally been considered a violation of human rights. As a result, the country faces pressure to pass laws against its practice. Tenneh was subjected to female genital mutilation at the age of 8 years old in Sierra Leone in order to prepare her for marriage."

In 2008 when I was sixteen I was sent to Pakistan after having failed my exams. My father decided to send me to Pakistan on the pretence that I was going to visit my mother but then he refused to let me go back to Germany. After five months my father also decided to join us in Pakistan. Within one week of his arrival, he told me that he had found me someone to marry. The young boy was one of my father’s friend’s sons from a rural village. I explained to my father that I was too young to get married but he was very angry and accused me of bringing shame and dishonour to the family. My father told me that he was ashamed of me because I had failed my exams. To add to my heartache a few days later my father divorced my mother and threw her out of the family house. I felt responsible for this and it made me feel ill and stressed. I knew things could get a lot worse. My brother and sister were also summoned to Pakistan by my father and I realised that this must be to do with the wedding. I wanted to see my mother and decided to go and visit her; she was living with one of her relatives. When I was with her she received a phone call from her brother and sister. They were putting pressure on her to go back home. Her brother even threatened to kill her. I had the full support of my mother, she didn’t want me to get married at such a young age but I was very scared about what would happen to me and what they would do to my mother. The family kept putting pressure on me to accept the proposal for marriage. I attended a wedding where I met some of my mother’s relatives who were from Britain. I was so desperate and confided in one of them. I explained about my current situation and asked him if he could help me to escape. I told him that I had British passport so he decided to help me. He gave me the British High Commission telephone number and I contacted them. Someone from the High Commission met me and took me to an unknown location. I stayed there for three weeks until my mother’s relative tried to find accommodation/safe place for me in Britain. Three weeks later, he had arranged accommodation for me with Ashiana. I arrived in Britain and was taken to Ashiana.I was supported by them emotionally and also practically, they helped me to access to education and benefits. When I was ready, they supported me to find my own accommodation. I continue to study and now look forward to my future.   Narrative provided by ASHIANA"," It is estimated that 21% of girls in Pakistan are married before the age of 18. Child marriage in the country is connected with tradition, culture and custom. It occasionally involves the transfer of money, settlement of debts or exchange of daughters sanctioned by a Jirga or Panchayat. The government have recently taken measures to reduce the occurrence of child marriage by amending the Penal Code in February 2017 that would see offenders face a minimum of 5 years in prison. However, that same year, the National Assembly rejected the Child Marriage Restrain Act that would have increased the legal age of marriage from 16 to 18 years old nationwide.

But before we left, she made me swear an oath that I would repay all the costs of the documents, travel and living when we arrived. I was taken to the North of England and the ‘repayments’ began. I was forced to sleep with men who regularly came to the house.  I asked my Auntie when I would be able to start training to become a doctor, but she told me this was now my life. The house was comfortable, but this was added to my debt that I had to repay. On many occasions I became pregnant.  When I did, my Auntie would give me strong medicines, along with a lot of alcohol and use a metal hanger to remove the fetus. This procedure was added to the debt I owed. I didn’t understand at the time how bad this situation was as my Auntie was the only person who had ever shown care and affection towards me. At the age of 21 I escaped, but got into a relationship with a man who was controlling and abusive. I became pregnant and gave birth to my daughter, and a couple of years later my son. I would spend days in the house with my two young children freezing and with no money for food. I had no choice but to secretly sleep with men to get enough money for food. We lived off Weetabix. Eventually we were thrown out of the house after the man realised what I was doing. It was then I was referred to City Hearts as a victim of human trafficking. When I arrived at the City Hearts safe house, I was in a dark place. I was confused and so used to anything good in life being part of a deal which would have to be repaid. I almost ran away as I could not comprehend the kindness; instead, I was expecting a repayment to be required at some point soon, or find out it was yet another trap. I have gone from survival and just getting through each day, to LIVING! I am living my life and I am full of hope!  City Hearts have helped with reward charts and food taster sessions for my children. I am doing a childcare course, English and sewing classes and am surrounded by opportunity. I don’t know what the future holds but I am hopeful about what that looks like for me and my family. My daughter said to me this morning, “Mummy, you’re a superwoman” and I was able to reply “Yes, yes I am!”   Narrative provided by City Hearts "," The United Kingdom remains a significant destination for men, women and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. At least one child a day is trafficked into Britain according the to the Human Trafficking Foundation, with children forced to work in the sex industry, domestic service, cannabis cultivation or as criminal on the streets.  Child victims of human trafficking primarily originate from Romania, Vietnam, Nigeria, and from within the UK itself. Agnes was running away from an abusive home life when she met a woman who took her in. Agnes was offered the chance to travel to the UK to train to become a doctor under the promise she would repay the cost of travel. However, upon arriving, she was forced to provide sexual services to men as part of her ‘repayment’. Agnes was able to escape at the age of 21 but was forced to continue sex work in order to be able to afford to live. It was not until Agnes arrived at City Hearts that she was able to obtain skills and childcare and begin building for a better future."
Henrick,2018 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Eastern Europe (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"When I was 20 and living in Eastern Europe, someone I thought was my friend told me I could earn £2000 a month working in a factory in the UK. I accepted the job straight away.  There was no hope for me in my country. Things were bad in my life; I had made a few mistakes and was looking for a way out and a new start. So I thought I had nothing to lose. I was wrong. After two days of driving, I arrived in the UK with three other men. As soon as we got to the house, one of the men took my passport. From then on, we were not allowed out. We were kept as prisoners and physically threatened. For five months I was forced to work for no more than £5 a week in different places; a pizza parlour, chicken factory, selling mobile phones and distributing flyers. I was forced to steal petrol and scrap metal and made to open false bank accounts in my name. I was afraid to escape as I thought that the police would deport me because I had no ID. It was awful. At times I felt suicidal. Over time the men started to watch us less, and one night we overheard them speaking about transferring us to another area to work for other people. My heart sank. What was going to happen next? I couldn’t take it anymore and the others agreed. We had to get out. We jumped out of a window and ran to the police who took us to a City Hearts Safe House. From the moment I arrived, I felt they cared and believed in me. At first I was just so angry at the men who had done this to me and wanted to see them punished. The City Hearts staff stood by me as I relived my experience to the police. They never left my side through the whole process. I felt so supported. I was assisted in closing the fraudulent accounts I had been forced to open, helped in clearing my record, and was aided in sorting out my teeth as they needed urgent attention. I also got a chance to go to English classes. I feel so much more confident now when I meet and talk to new people. I can attend appointments on my own, and can even help my new friends with the things I have learnt at City Hearts. My whole outlook has changed. I now look at people with love and I want to build a life that I can invite my family to be a part of again. It felt like my life was impossible and that it could never change.

Charlotte B,2014 (Narrative date),Forced labour,United Kingdom (trafficked from),Nigeria (slavery location),"I am a member of the Croydon Community Against Trafficking, supporting its work helping victims of the international trade in people. Modern slavery happens in Croydon and affects people in Croydon, not just those from other parts of the world who come here, but also British nationals. I would like to see increased awareness of this. I also have a very personal reason for belonging to CCAT: my own frightening experience of human trafficking. In 2014 I travelled from Croydon to Nigeria to take up a post as a tutor, something I initially saw as an exciting opportunity to live abroad and gain experience working in an educational role with children. I was happy to be offered the job, but once I arrived in my wealthy employers’ home in Lagos, I quickly became worried by the situation I found there. During my first day, I noticed an unkempt housemaid who worked long hours and didn’t speak either much English or the local Nigerian language, Yoruba. We shared a name and I was immediately endeared to her. One of my employers told me that she paid not the housemaid herself, but the girl’s aunt who lived in Ghana and who she suspected was her ‘trafficker’. While this news worried me, I was not aware of the true meaning of trafficking at the time. But the housemaid’s mistreatment quickly became more apparent. My employers told me stories of beating her and punishing her when they suspected household items had gone missing. She was very timid and malnourished. Her living arrangements were hidden from me but I once found her curled up asleep on the floor in one of the living rooms downstairs. However, I could hear her sweeping and cleaning from the early hours of the morning. It was made apparent that my own civil rights were not going to be upheld when I was repeatedly asked by my employers to give them my passport. I had been instructed by the Nigerian embassy in London before travelling not to give my passport to anyone. However, a few hours after my arrival I was visited by two armed security guards who came to ‘collect my passport’ when I was at the house alone. I complied. I was left to eat alone every evening and could only leave the house under the instruction of my hosts. I was repeatedly told that if I went out alone I could put the child I was responsible for at risk and as his well-being was paramount I could only go where they needed me to go, when they needed me to go there. UK legislation defines people smuggling as ‘the procurement, to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit, of the illegal entry of a person into a state party of which the person is not a national’. Although I was not aware how I was to be exploited, it became apparent that I had been smuggled. I had left England with no job and no money. I hadn’t taken a copy of my travel documents and did not speak the local language. I called home and my family put pressure on my employers by ringing them throughout the day and night. I told my family where I was staying and relatives prepared to come to Nigeria to get me. That evening, I was summoned to a meeting with my employers who told me I was a nuisance. At six o’clock the next morning I was told a car was ready to take me to the airport. On leaving, I was handed my defaced passport. Airport officials said they would have refused to let me travel had my passport been Nigerian because of the condition it was in. When I returned home to Croydon, I joined CCAT so that I could make others aware of the realities of human trafficking and smuggling. I want to let people know that trafficking does not only affect refugees or migrants, but British nationals such as myself. While not all the CCAT volunteers share my story, many empathise, and have experienced or encountered victims of human trafficking. All are advocates of eradicating human trafficking.   Narrative originally published by The Croydon Citizen"," In 2016, the estimates of modern slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for approximately 13.6 percent of the world's total enslaved population. As evident from surveys conducted in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia by Walk Free Foundation, slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa takes the form of forced labour and forced marriage. In Ghana, survey results suggest that there are an estimated 103,300 people enslaved in that country, of which 85 percent are in forced labour, and 15 percent are in forced marriage. For forced labour, the main industries of concern are farming and fishing, retail sales and then manual labour and factory work. In Nigeria, survey results suggest that forced labour is predominantly within the domestic sector, although it was impossible to survey in three regions due to high conflict. In South Africa, the industries most reported in the survey include the commercial sex industry, manual labour industries such as construction, manufacturing and factory work, and drug trafficking. Charlotte travelled from Croydon to Nigeria in 2014 to work as a tutor. However, once she arrived in Lagos her passport was confiscated, and she was prevented from leaving the house. Charlotte was able to return home after her parents rang her employers day and night, pressuring them to let her come home. When she arrived home, Charlotte became a member of the Croydon Community Against Trafficking in order to educate people on the nature of human trafficking."
Theresa,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),""," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking.  Theresa was 15 years old when the man she had a crush on drugged and raped her. Using photos of the encounter as blackmail, Theresa was then forced to provide sexual services to men for 2 years. Today Theresa travels the world telling her story. "

I did not have a voice to make an independent decision. I started thinking of leaving and asked myself would anyone believe my story? Will the authorities believe me? One day I woke up and it was like a spirit erected me to come out of there. I had had enough. I was locked in the house but on this occasion the door was unlocked so I just opened the door. I didn’t take anything, I just ran. And I kept looking back to see if anyone was chasing me. After a while, I started walking in the street and crying. I was met by a Christian women, one of the fake ones, the women asked me why I was crying and I told her my story. She then told me that if I approached the police they would take me back to my country. I became very scared and she said she would help me. She asked me to make a secret agreement with her to tell no one about my story and that she would help me so that I don’t go back to my country.

Because I was trafficked back home, promised a better life in the UK, turned into a prostitute in the UK. So the police came, I spoke to them, they didn’t believe me. They didn’t even listen to me. They just detained me to a police station. From the time I called them. The next thing I knew I was in a removal centre to be deported back to my country. That’s when I got my brain back and I was like people warned me, never call police, never do this and I was so innocent I didn’t know what to do. Because I thought if you have a problem, you call the police. And that’s what I did. I stayed in the removal centre with tormenting letter saying you’re going to be deported back home, you’re illegally whatever, I don’t know what’s legal I don’t know what’s illegal, all sorts of things. In the detention centre I was there helpless, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know where to start from. I was just there waiting to be taken back to my traffickers. So, a lady came to my rescue, I don’t know how she came, how she knew that I was there, she’s the lady just opposite me. From the Poppy Project. They just put my name on the visas list, they called me, she came, ‘Ellie’, I said yes. She asked me how I grew up, how I came into UK, how I escaped, how I contacted the police, and that’s how I was released from the detention centre.     This narrative was recorded at Trust Conference, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s flagship event.

The country is the destination for men, women and children trafficked for forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. The majority of trafficking victims are foreign women who migrate willingly seeking work, but find themselves trapped in debt bondage, having to work in domestic and sex work to pay off fees incurred. Despite warning from the U.N., it is reported that human trafficking is on the rise in Japan.  Marcela couldn’t afford to pay her daughter's hospital bills when she rang an agent who had recently offered her a job as a professional dancer abroad. The agent paid off the hospital bills and arranged for Marcela to travel to Tokyo. However, upon arrival Marcela was told that she would have to work providing sexual services to men in order to pay off the debt incurred from her travel costs. After 18 months, Marcela was assisted by one of her clients and was able to escape, making her way to the Colombian embassy in Japan and eventually back home to her daughter. "
Rachel,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),""," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking.    Rachel was living in a chaotic household when she was first trafficked at 6 years old.  Rachel was forced to provide sexual services under threats of physical violence to herself and her family.

Dorothy,2018 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,Children,Malawi (slavery location),"I went to school, but didn’t see the point of continuing. We were poor and my school uniform was in bad state. I was ashamed. I thought marriage was a great thing – and better for me than education. My mother thought a son in-law would help our family with food and money. We had no food, and I would go for days without eating. My husband had several girlfriends and mistresses. He used to lock me inside and not let me out until the next day, so that he was free to visit his girlfriends. My husband was arrogant. His reaction was to say that I could leave if I wanted, that it didn’t matter to him. He could just get a new wife. He really didn’t care, and today he is married to another woman. My husband didn’t want a child anyway. If it had been up to him, I would have had an abortion. But I refused. I was scared and I thought I could die. The only way to have an abortion here is by taking traditional medicine which is unsafe.

He married me, and then he dumped me. Now I’m on my own, with a child I have to provide for. Our biggest challenge, especially when we’re talking to parents, is that it’s hard to offer any good alternatives. For many, desperate poverty is what makes them marry off their daughters, and we can’t provide them with the money they need to keep them in school.

Naganna,2013 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Children,India (trafficked from) Children,India (slavery location),"I was 10 years old when I started working in bonded labour. I was there for nearly 36 years in labour. I am now 46 years old. It was agriculture type of work and at night I was doing the motor irrigation in field. I also did misc work for the owner like washing clothes in the owners home, filling the water from the pond and carrying it to the house. They also made me wash the ladies clothes but I did not feel right about doing that so I refused, but they beat him many times for refusing to do anything they asked. They were scolding and beating me often. My grandfather had borrowed Rs.20,000 so my grandfather, my father and then I had to work for this same family to pay it off. They also gave a lot of harassment to my son. The landowner charged a very high interest and also sometimes they gave money during the festival time or if one of us were very sick. They now are saying we owe them Rs. 30,000. Every year during the festival time we were taking Rs.2,000 - 3,000 to live off of for the year and in marriage time they gave us Rs. 6,000. My grandfather worked for 15 years, then my father worked for them and then they brought me. I started at 6am and I would be working until 8pm without a rest except to just to take food. Then I had to monitor the irrigation motor at night. I slept at night in the irrigation field as I had to switch on the motor and monitor it. Snakes would often bite my legs in the field and the landowners would not help me. One time the forest pigs attacked me and I still have the scars from the attack. My wife found me and took me to hospital by selling her gold nose ring. No payments except festival time. My father is still continuing in the bondage. Jeevika has helped to save my life and they have helped me get my release certificate. I am now working for Jeevika. Jeevika has also helped to save my son. He met an accident recently and Jeevika gave us Rs. 10,000 for the hospital bills to fix my son's fractured leg. The owner had a daughter-in-law named Asha, who was living in the home when I was staying there and working in the agriculture field. The owner was sexually harassing the daughter in law. One day Asha had called my son, Mallaiah, to come as they needed some work to be done. This was just for normal activity that he was required to do. But due to the sexual harassment of her father-in-law, she decided to commit suicide and jumped in the well later that day. When they found her, the police came and they looked at the call list and found that she had call to Mallaiah. The owner was wanting to cover up the sexual abuse he was doing so he created a false claim accusing my son of murdering Asha. My son was only 17 years old and he was very scared as the police were very supportive of the landowner. But because of my new association with Jeevika and the support they gave us during this time, the owner got scared. That is the only reason the owner dropped the charges on my son. The owner is demanding our home if we leave. Our entire family is in this home and we do not have anywhere else to live and survive. We do not have the ability to just leave. The land owner is very powerful and we are afraid of what they will do. I was treated like a machine, not a person. I would get regular beatings with a stick. The owner would look at the clock and if I did not complete the work at a certain time they would beat me. I have only the one son, who is 17 years old. Years ago, when my wife was pregnant she fell down when a tractor came into her path. We begged the landowner to help us pay for a hospital for her, but they did not give any money for hospital purposes. She lost the baby and was never able to have any more children. I work with Jeevika now and I am a team lead working in this area. I now give many awareness speeches as part of Jeevika's work in the villages. There are 58 bonded laborers in this village today and 4 people still work with the same landowner and bonded laborers. The remaining 21 workers are with daily wages now. I am also constructing a home under NREGA, (a central government scheme). When I came to Jeevika, this was the only time I was able to wear clothes. Up until this, I only wore a towel and underwear. In the villages there are some terrorists called Nacasalites. One day these Nacasalites came to the village and started demanding food from me so I provided them food. When they were eating they set their rifle in my house. The police were somehow informed that there were Nacasalites there and they came to my house. The Nacasalites were able to sneak off but I was left with the rifle in the house. The police then arrested me. The police made him squat down with bricks on my calves and beat me with a stick. Then they gave me a warning and let me leave. Narrative Courtesy of Freedom Child: Awareness for Modern Day Slavery"," While bonded labour has been outlawed for decades, survey data and pre-existing research confirms that this practice still persists. Bonded labour is not only illegal, research confirms that it has serious negative health impacts for those affected, who typically work in unsanitary and dangerous working conditions with no access to health care. Naganna was 10 years old when he started working as a bonded labourer, inheriting his grandfather’s debt. Naganna was forced to work long hours without rest and subjected to physical violence. It was with the help of Jeevika charity that Naganna was able to escape his situation and is now working with the charity. "
Nargis,2016 (Narrative date),Forced marriage,Bangladesh (trafficked from),Bangladesh (slavery location),"I studied until the eighth grade. I really liked school; my favorite subject was science. I had a dream to study law, but my parents couldn’t afford it. Although I knew of the consequences of an early marriage, I still ended up getting married at 14 because my parents are extremely poor. At the time of the wedding, I was very nervous. I didn’t know my husband – even now I don’t know his age. I think he’s around 25 and he works in sales. I didn't want to move into his house. I remember crying a lot. Everyone around me somehow convinced me though. I didn’t know anything about the human body. I started having my periods only two or three months before my marriage. I got pregnant and I was fine, I didn't feel sick. At first I didn't want to be a mother but after I got married, people change their mind. You don’t think like before. I had some complications during my labour so I was supposed to have a C-section. Because of my very low blood count, they couldn’t do it. I had a normal delivery instead and it was very painful. I wasn’t afraid, but it was so hard. I felt happy seeing my son for the first time. I didn't recognise this feeling before but now I understand how it feels to be a mother. My husband was also very happy. He always wanted a son. Now I take contraceptive pills. It was my husband who suggested this idea. I don’t want any more children right now. I'm working in a garment factory to save enough money for the future so that my son can get an education and move forward in life. I stitch sleeves. It's not so hard; the machine does all the work. I get up at 5.30 in the morning and then I cook. I have my breakfast, take a shower and feed my son. At seven o’clock I take the staff bus. I come back home after work around eight o’clock in the evening. If my son is sleeping, I don’t wake him up. If he’s awake I feed him, finish dinner and get ready for bed. I do feel bad that I’m away from him all day. But when he starts school I won’t work anymore. Then I'll be there to help him with his studies.  All my future plans now are for my son. When Nayeem turns three, he’ll start school. I do have dreams of my own and that's to pass my exams and finish school. My husband has said that he will let me study later. For now I'm happy with my life. I’m married and I have a son. Do people ever stay the same after this?   This narrative was produced as part of the #childmothers initiative, a joint initiative between Plan International and UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), to highlight the issue of very early motherhood.  "," Despite signs of progress, Bangladesh continues to have one of the highest child marriage rates in the world.66% of girls in Bangladesh are married under 18 with the average age of marriage for girls in the country being 15.

Children in the care system and unaccompanied migrant children are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. The United Kingdom remains a significant destination for men, women and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. At least one child a day is trafficked into Britain according the to the Human Trafficking Foundation, with children forced to work in the sex industry, domestic service, cannabis cultivation or as criminal on the streets.  Child victims of human trafficking primarily originate from Romania, Vietnam, Nigeria, and from within the UK itself.     Sarah was 10 years old when she began buying illegal cigarettes and alcohol from a gang in the UK, often not having to pay because they were her 'friends'. After 2 years, the gang told Sarah that she had a £75,000 debt that she would have to pay for by transporting drugs and providing sexual services. Despite being in the care system, at school and having a social worker, it wasn't until a police officer looked further in to Sarah's case that she was rescued from her situation. Sarah talks about the system failures that led to her trafficking. "

The prevalence of poverty in China makes the poor more vulnerable to enslavement. With the National Bureau of Statistics estimating that 70,170,000 are still living in poverty, people are more desperate and thus more likely to be receptive to fraudulent job offers.   Neng was just 14 when she was taken to China by her cousin who upon arrival forced her to marry a man 15 years her senior.

Chairat,2015 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",Indonesia (slavery location),""," Benjina Island lies 400 miles to the north of Australia and has been the home of an illegal fishing operation for a number of years. While only one company was registered to use the island, investigations by labour rights organisations has found that the island acted as a port and base for fishing operations across the region. The island functioned as a makeshift prison, with small cages found where trafficked fisherman would be kept if they clashed with their employers or asked too many questions. It was when the Labour Rights Promotion Network joined forced with the Associate Press and Thai TV Channel 3 after hearing stories from survivors who had escaped the island, mounted a search for the island that they found shocking human rights violations.  Chairat was trafficked on to a Thai fishing boat and then found himself imprisoned on Benjina Island where enslaved fisherman were imprisoned, forced to fight and were often killed.   "
Noi,2018 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Laos (trafficked from),China (slavery location),""," The internal migration of Chinese people seeking work has created an opportunity for human traffickers in China. Moreover, the gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result, many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them. The prevalence of poverty in China makes the poor more vulnerable to enslavement. With the National Bureau of Statistics estimating that 70,170,000 are still living in poverty, people are more desperate and thus more likely to be receptive to fraudulent job offers.     Noi was just 17 years old when she was forced to drop out of high school in northern Laos’ Luang Namtha province to earn money for her family. When a middleman approached her in early 2015 about marrying a man across the border in China in exchange for around 40 million kip (U.S. $4,830)—despite the legal age for marriage in China being 20—she jumped at the chance. After holding a small party with her relatives, according to the traditions of her Leu ethnic group, Noi travelled to China to live with the man. During the first three months, he treated her kindly and sent small payments to her parents in Laos, but soon his demeanour changed and he began to beat her. "

Lea,2016 (Narrative date),Forced labour Children,Children,Indonesia (slavery location),""," Men, women and children make up those trafficked in Indonesia, subjected to forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Brokers working in rural areas are known to lure men and boys into forced labour on palm oil, rubber and tobacco plantations, while women and under-age girls are lured into work as domestics in private homes and as commercial sex workers. Rising unemployment and slowed job creation has pushed people into the informal sector unprotected by labour laws and thus made them more vulnerable to exploitation. There are currently only 18 shelters in Indonesia working to rescue and rehabilitate survivors of human trafficking.    Lea, now 26 and a native of Nafai village in Savannakhet province’s Kaisone district, was first sold as a teen to work in Thailand on a rubber plantation by a neighbour. After four months working to pay off their 'debt' to their employer, Lea escaped the plantation. At 15 years old, alone and with no money, he made his way to Bangkok where a taxi driver told him her could earn good money working on a fishing boat. Lea was locked in a house for 3 days before being taken on to the fishing boat where he would work long hours with little rest for 3 years without pay. Lea was finally able to escape, hiding in a forest after being taken ashore. Lea now works as a labourer on construction sites on and in other jobs on Tuan Island as he waits to go home. "

Significant numbers of male Cambodians continued to be recruited in Thailand to work on fishing boats and subjected to forced labor on Thai-owned vessels in international waters. Cambodian victims escaping from this form of exploitation have been identified in Malaysia, Indonesia, Mauritius, Fiji, Senegal, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea.

Then we went by car, it was a police car. It was a small car that would usually seat only three or four people, but we had to get seven our eight in it. We had to hide and we couldn’t breathe, that was the biggest problem. But if you want to work you just have to put up with the hardships and go. When we come to stay here and live in the camp we are not allowed to travel outside. In terms of survival, yes, we are able to exist there, and we are given rations, but it is not enough. So we need to find a way to get more food. Put simply, we do the jobs that Thai people don’t want to do. If Thai people don’t want to do it then the Thai boss will hire Burmese people. On the way there we were all in a van and there were two policemen who went ahead on a motorbike.  There was one more who stayed with us, he spoke into his radio to keep in touch with the others the whole way. The first place I worked was a clothing factory. We worked from six in the morning until nine at night. We were not allowed outside and we each had to pay the police 500 baht every month. We had to buy all our food there. The owner sold it to us. By the end of the month, after we took out the cost of food and the money for the police, there was almost nothing left. This is what we have to face. On the boats, if you are sold to a boat you have to consider yourself a dead man already. And for the women who are sold they will be imprisoned in a home compound. The boss will lock them in all the time. Some are not even allowed to make telephone calls. Some bosses abuse them. Some bosses beat them. Some will yell, and some will beat you. There’s one girl who is back in the camp now her boss beat her until the top of her skull came off. She had it covered by a steel plate. Now she wraps her head in a scarf all the time. Yes my sister disappeared. It started when we took her to a Thai lady’s place who found her the job and took her to the boss. Later that year my older brother went to visit her. He was going to her boss’s home but they wouldn’t let him, so they took my sister to the Thai lady’s house and let them meet there. Within a year they wouldn’t let us meet anymore but we could still keep in touch by phone. My brother would call and talk to her. But now, for the last four years we haven’t been able to contact her. We don’t know who to call. We’ve looked, asked people, and searched for her but we haven’t heard a thing. The one thing that I want is a place where I can be free.

[Cho Cho’s beatings stopped only after she agreed to work as a laborer in the farmer’s fields] [Alone one morning, she walked away and fled to a police station in a nearby town.  Instead of taking her back to her owner, as they sometimes do, the police held her for three months as an illegal alien and then deported her to Burma] I told my husband everything when I got home, and he accepted me back, The scars are gone.  No more scars…(but) I’m still heartbroken telling this story   Copyright © 1998-2016, RFA.

Moreover the gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them. Women and girls are kidnapped or recruited through marriage brokers and transported to China from Africa, Asia and North Korea where some are subjected to commercial sex or forced labor. Cho Cho, who was 18 and married, was selling the betel nut chew so popular with Burmese men when a man from her neighborhood approached her with the promise of a job in Mandalay.  However, instead of a job, Cho Cho found herself on a truck bound for China and upon arrival, was sold to a Chinese man to be married. After refusing to marry the man that bought her, Cho Cho was forced to work as a labourer. She was finally able to escape to the police who deported her back to Burma."
Ko Wunna,2009 (Narrative date),Forced labour Migration,Myanmar (trafficked from) Migration,Malaysia (slavery location),"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/traffickers-04292009084732.html?searchterm:utf8:ustring=Human+Trafficking   I was arrested [by Malaysian immigration authorities] on Nov. 15, 2008 and was sentenced to jail for two months and one stroke of the lash. I was released on Jan. 2, 2009. After I was released from prison, the Thai human traffickers [to whom Ko Wunna says he was then sold by immigration authorities] told me to buy myself 'back in' [to work in Malaysia] from the border town of Changlun. But they wanted 2050 ringgit (U.S. $570) to buy myself back in. I couldn’t give them that much money. Those who could pay were able to leave. Seven of us were left behind. We told them that we would work our way out. But they would not accept it. They said if we could not pay we would be sold to an Indonesian boat under a five-year plan. What we heard about this five-year plan was that if we were unable to work, they would kill us, beat us to death. We were afraid, so we escaped in the night. The traffickers and their Thai boss chased us. We fled into the forest. In the morning we saw a tea shop and asked for help. The people in the tea shop asked what nationality we were. We told them we were from Burma. They said we should contact the police. We thought about it. The traffickers chasing us had iron rods and were closing in on us. They also had motorcycles and if we crossed the street they would have tried to hit us with their cars. And if we were caught by the Thais we knew we would be dead. So we decided it would be better to be arrested, so we surrendered to the police. The police told us to wait while they telephoned their officer in charge. The police told us to sit and wait at the tea shop. While we were waiting the police officer arrived. But it seemed that the police officer and the traffickers had done business in the past, because one of the traffickers came along with the police officer. They told us to get into the car. The police officer himself drove the car while the trafficker sat next to him. They took us to the same place that we had been kept before. After leaving us there, the police left, after receiving 2,000 ringgit from the traffickers. There were four traffickers. They kicked us with their boots. Later three more of them arrived with a gun and a metal chain. They hit us, but not on our faces where the injuries could be seen. They also used knuckle-dusters to hit us on our bodies. After we were caught again, the price [to leave the gang] went up to 3,000 ringgit. They said that if we did not pay the 3,000, the Thai bosses would cut our legs off as an example to the others... I was concerned so I contacted my home, but they were also in a tight situation in terms of money. So I did not ask for help from them again. There was no way I could pay the money they asked for. So they told me to work for the payment. I agreed and did what they told me to do. After that they did not look after the new arrivals, they just kept them in that big house with just me looking after the new arrivals ... The traffickers gave me a phone, a book, and a ball-point pen. I had to register their names, their destination, and the phone numbers the new arrivals were calling. Those who could pay the money were brought forward first. The traffickers first showed me how to deal with the new arrivals. If they could pay 2,500 ringgit they were allowed to make the telephone call. If they could not pay, or if they said they would pay at the end of the month or later, I was told to hit them across their faces. Since they asked me to hit them, I had to do it. It was not easy, as I myself had gone through the same fate in the past. But I had to hit them because if I did not do as I was told they would turn against me. So I had to hit them a bit in front of the trafficker. But after the traffickers had left, I would apologize to the new arrivals. I told them that I would have to hit them, kick them, and treat them roughly in front of the traffickers, but that I was not really like that. And I asked them to understand my situation. They understood, as all of us were Burmese.   Copyright © 1998-2016, RFA.

Some of these migrants are subjected to forced labour or debt bondage by their employers, employment agents, or informal labour recruiters when they are unable to pay the fees for recruitment and associated travel. Ko Wunna is a 28-year-old resident of Burma's former capital, Rangoon, who was trafficked to Malaysia by gangs importing illegal workers in a constantly revolving racket in which, former participants say, the Malaysian police are also complicit.  Here, Ko Wunna about his experiences over three months working for a trafficking gang in the region in and around northern Malaysia's Kedah province, which borders Songkhla and Yala provinces in Thailand. He reveals that illegal migrants who don't come under the aegis of one gang are vulnerable to worse exploitation by others."

I was beaten, raped, forced against my will. They would put out cigarette butts on me and cut me with razors. He told me that if I really wanted to work I could come with him, but that if I did not intend to pursue work there I could be back in Croatia in three days. t sounded rather convincing. Given that my life had been miserable since I was born -- my father was an alcoholic and my mother ill -- I went there without a second thought. As soon as I arrived and as soon as he brought me to his apartment, everything started. He told me there was no work and that I had crossed the border in order to work as a prostitute, that he had paid a ton of money for me and that he will come for me in three days, and that I had to be ready by then. I told him to get his mother ready instead, and then he hit me on the head with his fist. Since we were in the kitchen I turned around and struck him with a pot. Naturally, I was no match for him physically. He beat and raped me constantly for three days, to the point where I was lying in blood and urine while tied to a bed. He then brought two of his friends who raped me, put out cigarette butts on me, and cut me with razors. That man was from Bosnia. We found in his apartment four passports and another girl from Croatia who was also a mother of three. That was a complete horror. They beat me endlessly. A girl of 16 from Albania almost bled to death in my arms because they had pushed a car antenna into her vagina. A girl from Bosnia was found dead. That is when I completely broke down. There was no way for me to be freed from what had happened to me. I endured this for six years. I went to the street with prostitutes, not in order to work, but to see the people who come to them and who force them to do this. Then I would throw a bottle of gasoline on their car or puncture their tires. I didn’t care what would happen. I did one or three customers -- I didn't care. I didn’t look at those people. I rehearsed this since I was six. I recited 'The Pit,' a poem by Ivan Goran Kovacic, persistently to myself as my father beat me with roots from the vineyard or his military belt, as he would throw me against a wall or door, or kick me with his military boots. That was my defense. That is how I distanced myself. Although I would bleed, having been burnt all over with cigarette butts, I would distance myself from all that. [Today, Martina is 29 years old. She lives in Zagreb and has a 7-year-old son. She is still undergoing therapy] I started to work on a regular job in Zagreb. However, since I’m not psychologically strong I break down very easily.

[Martina was offered that cup of coffee by activists from the Center for Sexual Rights/Women’s Room and the Center for Women Victims of War (ROSA). For the first time in her life, she says, somebody approached her without scorn] If it weren’t for them, I don’t know how our life would have continued, the life of all of us who were tortured, mistreated, sold in different ways. We can reach a particular point on our own, and when we cannot go any further we all need a ferry, a crossing, a helping hand, somebody’s smile. Now I’m cleaning grannies’ apartments. I drink coffee with them and call them my well of wisdom. With their help, you can go back and remember some of the good roots of life. My life currently consists of women from the center and my son. Even today, when I see gestures by some people, certain motions that remind me of that life, I immediately break down and want to jump at them. With the help of women from the center, I learned to control myself pretty well. This business has been developed in Croatia precisely and efficiently.

John A.,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Uganda (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is John and I am from Uganda. My father died when I was 12 years old and since then I had been supported by my mother. When I was around 15 years old I realized that I was gay. I was often threatened and harassed by other people because being homosexual in Uganda was forbidden. Anyone exposed could face imprisonment and torture.   I was expelled from school when they found out but I managed to continue my education and obtain a degree in IT. I was able to get a good job as a sales representative and buy my own car. But when my employer found out about my sexual orientation I was fired. After I lost my job, I moved back with my mother. But again, the rumours about me spread quickly and our neighbours started harassing her.   One night someone set fire to our house and my mother died inside. As if this was not heartbreaking enough, the rest of our family blamed me for her death and disowned me.   I was so unhappy and scared. The people who burnt down our house were looking for me in order to kill me. I didn’t know what to do. In the end, I contacted a friend who knew someone who could get me out of the country. I sold my car and managed to put together the $2000 I needed to pay for my travel, without knowing where I would end up. This person helped with my visa application and promised to take me to a place where I could have a good job and future.   In October 2013, I travelled together with this person and arrived at Edinburgh airport. After going through immigration, the trafficker took my passport. From the airport, I was taken to a flat where I saw some other men. I was locked in a room by myself and was only allowed out for 30 minutes a day to cook myself something to eat. I had no phone, TV, keys or contact with the other people staying at the flat.    I had lived like this for a month when one day a white man in his 40’s came and said he could help me. I was told to take all my belongings and go with him. We drove away and after some time he stopped and told me to perform a sexual act on him. I refused and he got very angry shouting that he had paid money for me. He tried to get into the back of the car where I was sitting but I managed to get out and ran away. I was completely lost and slept rough that night. The following day I asked a stranger on the street for help and he sent me to a local charity. When I told them about my situation, they referred me to Migrant Help.   Migrant Help advisers supported me in many ways. They assisted with my asylum claim by helping me to find a solicitor, they attended Home Office interviews with me and supported me during the Police investigation of my case. They provided financial support during a particularly difficult period in my life. On top of these essentials, they also arranged counselling for me which has helped me enormously in overcoming my traumatic experience.   Eventually, I was granted refugee status and was able to start rebuilding my life. I have managed to make friends and I now live in a rented flat with one of them. I have a good job working in a call centre and have continued my studies.

Included in the types of slavery prevalent in China is forced labour, with China's unprecedented rise to the world's second largest economy and its domestic economy specialising in the production of labour-intensive, cheap goods for export, increasing the demand for cheap labour. Forced labour occurs in both the manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as more informal industries such as brick kilns and garment facoties. Many women are also tricked in to forced labour as domestic servants, lured by the promise of good jobs with high incomes they instead find themselves confined to the house and forced to work long hours with little or no pay.  Sian Men Mawi legally worked as a maid in Singapore before moving to China, lured by the promise of a lucrative employment contract.

Yeonmi Park (Narrative 2),2018 (Narrative date),Forced marriage,North Korea  (slavery location) North Korea (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"Thank you. Thank you everyone for coming and having me here. Erm, it, it was quite a journey to be here, coming here. When I was escaping I didn’t know I was going to end up here at the UN in New York and sitting next to Mr Forrest. I grew up in a very average, normal family. I had one sister, I had a very both loving parents. And as Mr Jung said, I did not know that my country was isolated. You know if you know that you’re isolated, that means you’re not isolated. That is complete blockage of information, there’s no internet, there’s not 24 hours of electricity. I didn’t even know that passport people can have and leave the country, and there isn’t a map of the world. Also of course I had no words for my status, which I was a slave to the regime. But when I was 13, in 2007, I faced starvation, I was very hungry. And in March I was really having stomach pain and my mother took me to a hospital and in North Korea we don’t have machines to examine what’s wrong with you. The doctor just touched my belly and that afternoon he said ‘you have, actually appendix, we have do the surgery on you’. So he cut my belly that afternoon without any anaesthesia and he removed my appendix, even though it was just malnutrition and infection. He closed my stomach that afternoon and we don’t have bathroom inside a hospital, we have to go walk outside to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom there are like piles of human bodies. And you know, when you die when you’re being a corpse, the first part of the rats eating you is your eyes, they eat human eyes and they eat all our parts. But we are so hungry so we eat those rats back. They have disease and they kill us. My mother asked the nurse, why are they not moving those dead bodies? She said ‘we do not have gas to remove them’. That’s when we realise if you and I do not escape, you’re going to be like those people who are eaten by rats. As soon as I got out the hospital the next day, we found a broker who wanted to send us to China. I do not know why she wanted to help me to go to China, I simply wanted to go because if I don’t leave North Korea I’m going to die from starvation. Er, once we crossed the frozen river with the broker who sent us, they first thing I saw was my mother being raped. I was 13, but this Chinese broker said he wanted to have sex with me. In North Korea there is no sex education, so I did not know what that was. My mother offered herself and after that we realised that Chinese guardmen, once we escaped to China, they don’t protect us as political refugees, they catch us and they send us back. So, what we do, we were sold. We had to force marry Chinese people. My mother was sold for over $60 in 2007 and I was sold for over $200, because I was a virgin and I was young. From them man who bought me I learned that if I go to South Korea I could be free, and that meant crossing the Gobi desert from China to Mongolia. It was 2009, we had 8 people in our team, I was walking across the desert. I was 15, but I think the scariest thing for me that night crossing the desert was not even getting killed. It was being forgotten, that no one knew I existed in this world. And from that desert I did make it to South Korea, and I came to American to study at Columbia University two years ago. I think that’s what this index does. That this index makes us visible. That it shows that to the world that we exist. There’s over 40 million people that we estimate to be slaves. These are not numbers, it could be anyone. It was me, it was my mother, it was my sister. Even to this day now there are 300,000 North Korean defectors in China, and 90% of them are being trafficked. They are being sold by Chinese men for a few hundred dollars. And I do ask humanity again, because when I went to South Korea, I learned this concept like animal rights. And we talked about equality and we talked about so many things, and people told me very thoroughly that we went to the moon and we are planning to go to mars. I just couldn’t believe that as a humanity, how can we answer these women or people? If we have money, if we have intelligence, if we have technology to go to mars, we can’t even go to North Korea. We haven’t explored our earth yet and we are spending money and energy and resources to go to mars? I mean we should, but we should take care of human beings first. These people simply were born in the wrong place, and that’s what they’re being punished for, for their birthplace. So I think this is a significant step that we are taking because we are making these forgotten people visible to the rest of the humanity and everyone should have answer when people are free and they ask us what have you done for me? [crying] I mean we should tell them we did something for you guys. So thank you for taking this step, and I know so many people are inspired by animal rights, going to mars, I hope somebody will be inspired by human beings, and we do make it one of our agenda to free human beings. No more slaves in our next generation. Thank you so much, I’m so sorry. […] To answer the second question first, since I spoke out publicly that I am being denounced by Kim Jong-Un. He attempts to kill outspoken people, I mean he killed his half-brother in Malaysia, he obviously doesn’t care what people think. So I, I am on the black list of the regime and all the rest of my family in North Korea have disappeared, I do not know if they got executed or sent to a prison camp. So my father and mother’s side are both disappeared completely. That’s why it’s still bad for me even though I’m in New York that still that they are trying to silence me. And this is why you don’t see a lot of North Korean defectors speaking up, because they are risking their lives, as well as risking all their family’s lives back in North Korea. […] I’m a very optimistic person, if not I would not be here today. I think what kept me going when I thought I could die in that moment, was that you know, nothing is forever, that’s what history taught us, nothing is forever. And I believe that this slavery is not going to be forever, we will end it, and it’s gonna be like… I mean when you look at our whole human history, it’s going in the right direction generally. We did not have this concept of human right you know, a few centuries ago, it’s very recent thing. After World War II we started the UN, we came up with a peace and that’s what I see with North Korea, that the regime will end and that’s what I see with survivors like Mr Jung and other survivors are doing. They are not going to be silenced even though the dictator is still trying to kill us and silence us that I think, that’s what I personally want to do. I want to let everyone know what is happening and even now while we’re safe in New York, girls like myself are being sold in China for a few hundred dollars and simply we can stop it, and that’s what I do with my non-profit. I rescue these girls from China to safety and I keep trying to challenge Trump and any politician who does not want include human rights as one of the main agendas. And I hope as you said that media does play a big role. Until even a few years ago, North Korea was a joke. Media was busy making fun of Kim Jong-Un’s haircut. Seriously, that was the main news. I couldn’t believe that, what’s so funny about this dictator? What is so funny about people getting killed? And I think now finally we are going towards the right direction, we know this is not a joke, and we know this is happening and we can stop it. So I really appreciate that. As a media you have a power to redirect this conversation that this is not funny and this is something that we need to work on right now. And it should come above anything that we are doing in this free world.   As told at a United Nations Correspondents Association press conference, with the Walk Free Foundation to launch the Global Slavery Index 2018."," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that there are 2,640,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea).

Olga,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Israel (slavery location),"I searched for someone to talk to, and I found a Russian client who aroused my trust. He would take me for a few hours and let me sleep a little. He brought me a cell phone and told me to hide it. He promised me that he’d help me escape. And I decided that I could trust him. I didn’t live in the base, I lived in Yori’s apartment. Every day Yori would bring me to the base and bring me back to his place. But I didn’t know the address, I just chanced across a scrap [of paper] with it. I gave it to that client, and he called me one day on the phone and said “tomorrow at 10 am, jump from the window and we’ll come and pick you up.” And that’s what happened: I jumped from the window, it was on the second floor, and a guy in the car came and brought me to… There was another girl in the car and there was also a chase – they tried to block the car we were driving in but they didn’t succeed.

Natalie,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United Kingdom (slavery location),"This part of my story begins in 2011. An opportunity appeared to go abroad and work in England for a couple of weeks. I was flown to England and provided with a flat to work from. When I reached the UK, the arrangements, which I believed to have been made with my traffickers, suddenly changed. I lost my freedom and became a sex-toy. I was scared for my life as well as that of my family. They threatened they would harm my family if I did anything they didn’t like. I was scared to leave this situation and the weeks passed by. One day, though, after a long wait and lots of preparation, I made my way to freedom. I didn’t know, however, that it would be out of the frying pan into the fire. I found myself on the streets without money, friends, home or food. I became officially nobody. I was marching the streets of Manchester for a couple of weeks, trying to find a job, handing my CV into shops, coffee shops, bars, and fast food restaurants. But, it seemed as if I were a ghost, no one noticed me, no one wanted to give me a chance to prove myself and before I knew it I was back in the sex industry and working in a massage parlour. My financial issues were resolved for a while, but my confidence and mood started to sink so fast I almost fell into depression, I was disgusted by myself. But I couldn’t stay on the ground for long, as I discovered I was pregnant. I looked for help and contacted an organisation who I met through the parlour. They were helping women in need, such as drug/alcohol addiction and survivors of trafficking. I couldn’t stay in the sex industry any longer so I applied for a national insurance number and jobseekers’ allowance through the job-centre and started to actively seek for jobs again. As a result of being unsuccessful in finding a job, I decided I’d try to do some voluntary work to gain some work experience in the UK. Still, I didn’t find anything. This knocked back my confidence. Here was a smart girl, offering work any time of the day, and still no one was interested. In the meantime I made an anonymous report to the police through my caseworker, but received no response to that at this point. At the end of January 2012, I got fired from the parlour because of my pregnancy. I was out of money again, my rent was due and I was around 10 weeks pregnant. My claim for benefits was rejected in the middle of January, with the reason given that I have no proof of being a resident in the UK. So, yet again, I became homeless, penniless, and without dignity. And to add to that I was pregnant; my one and only hope and love growing in my tummy. The father and my best friend convinced me that I would be a bad mum to keep this innocent creature in my circumstances. So I put myself aside and arranged an abortion as my last option. On 1st February, the most regretful action of my life took place, I ended the life of my baby. On the 2nd February, I got a bill from the hospital for almost £700. That same week I got kicked out of the place where I lived as I could not pay the rent. Not having options available again I moved in with one of my clients. It was another bad move, but not having a choice, it was this or the streets. I soon found out that the guy was extremely jealous and he cut me off from the outside world. Yet again I became a caged bird. I couldn’t go out to the street, meet friends or even look for jobs. It only got worse when I tried to reach out for friends or help, I ended up physically abused and emotionally tortured, till the point that I considered ending my life. But help and love came unexpectedly. One afternoon, when the guy went out, I packed all my stuff and the baby’s dad came to help me escape, and offered me a place to live. After a couple of weeks of pulling myself together I tried getting benefits again as I didn’t want to be dependent on someone anymore. Almost a year after I had made my anonymous report to the police, someone finally contacted my caseworker. Soon after that I met a couple of police officers for a chat and they introduced me to the NRM system. Two days later my evidence was given and a week after the first meeting I was on my way to a safe house. I was relocated to a completely different part of England and handed over to caseworkers again, but this time it was a year after my escape. I felt lonely in the house. All the others had children, which made my heart hurt every single day and shrink to the size of a walnut. During my 45 days of recovery period, I got some medical check ups and my jobseekers finally got going. I also saw a counsellor, but other than this they were unable to help me. I wanted to get back to the city I knew and to the people I had got to know and trust. During my stay I managed to get a voluntary post in a charity shop through my own effort. When my time at the safehouse ended I felt I pretty much left with what I arrived with, my clothes. I had no home to go to, no job, nothing major changed in my life other than wasting 6 weeks of my life in a house where I felt suffocated, controlled and vulnerable again. So I went back to my boyfriend then and the New Year brought along some good. Thankfully through a local church and its members, a family offered me accommodation and another couple offered me a job, so at the end of January 2013 I finally started to work, paying taxes and on the way of becoming independent. But the torture didn’t finish just yet. I started to discover that the police mislead me on many occasions, and my disappointment burst out. I wanted to retract my evidence, but I had no options to do this by law. I felt let down by the community of people who are supposed to protect us.  It got so bad that we had to involve a mediator between myself and the leading detective as I felt as if he found it easy to lie to me. I found out that my traffickers were either on bail or on run, which made me feel vulnerable again. I woke up every morning wondering if this would be the day when they took their revenge on me. By the time their trial started at court all of my traffickers were on the run and it is still unknown where they are at this time. When I gave my evidence at court, thanks to the defence, I didn’t feel like a survivor. I was portrayed as a gold-digger who had tried to use the British system to gain free money. I cannot describe the anger I felt, that here I am, all this happened to me and they are calling me a liar and golddigger. As much as I want my traffickers to get their justice, people need to realise who keep this business running, your fathers, brothers, husbands visit working girls on a daily basis and if it wasn’t for that, sexual exploitation and trafficking offences would disappear from the court rooms. People have to realise they affect our lives unknowingly and the only one who can change this state is us, please be part of this. As a summary, the lack of well-known aftercare organisations, the lack of help around benefits or work for girls like myself, all affected me. Also police forces and law don’t support survivors of trafficking enough. My opinion is that not only traffickers but customers should be charged at some level for paying for sexual services, because if the market doesn’t stop, the business will always run. […] The best thing, that helped me the most, was my caseworker’s efforts. So, a big thanks to Jo! (from Natalie’s original local support organisation) Her frustrations about the things not moving forward for me and her nevergiving-up attitude showed that I’m doing the right thing in a faulty system which isn’t in my benefit. My suffering paid off and I’m finally on a path where I want to be. Also, a huge thank you to all the girls at the SHF. Your emotional support motivated me so much to create the dreams I have now, and I’m looking forward to this year. And to all the girls out there, don’t give up, you all worth better, and there is help out there, and every day which is harder than the day before will take you to the victory and at the end you will cherish those days because they will make you a stronger person, just don’t give up, a new day will always come!!! Since my escape the world collapsed around me, not only I’ve been in hopeless situation but every time I tried to make it better all I got is a door slammed into my face. It’s been several months before things started to change, I slowly gained my independence back and have created some sort of security around myself. I live in England which is foreign to me and building a future, I have a job and somewhere to live and through Sophie Hayes I gained some friends. I’d lie to say there are no more bad days in my life because there are many but what makes a difference is that I’m not alone anymore, and sharing your pain is the way towards healing. Everything I have, I built it by myself and it makes me proud, many of the people I know tell me I have incredible strength but as I see it, if I have had given up when the 1st door been closed in front of me, I wouldn’t be here today. Carrying on in a damaged world and confidence is hard, but if you give up you have already lost.

Amy,2014 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was sexually exploited by a local group of men from when I was 11 years’ old until I was about 13. I stopped going to school at the age of 11 and had some terrible fights with my mother, meaning that I would spend long hours in the local parks and town centre on my own. An older man took an interest in me. When I confessed my age he found it enticing, confusing my initial instinct that a grown man wouldn’t want to be friends with someone so young. He made sexual advances, which escalated until he pressured me into letting him have sex with me. He made fun of my underdeveloped body and insulted and humiliated me constantly. He insisted I had slept around with other boys. This went on for a few months, until another man took an interest in me. He was much younger, around 18, and had a car. He took me out for a date, and when I wouldn’t sleep with him, he told his mates I was really a boy. I was so embarrassed I allowed him to have sex me, just to prove a point. This boy was very abusive to me. He found it funny that I couldn’t tie my laces after I got dressed and told all his friends when he had slept with me. I was very unhappy and started spending time with one man, we’ll call him ‘Al’. He was very quiet and gentle. He soon started having sex with me too. It was confusing; I loved spending time with him because he was the only one who didn’t shout or swear at me. Al invited me to spend time with him and his friends at their flat (several men lived together). They lived in the same village as me, and I had no other place that I could go to. Different men would come to the flat and touch me. At first I said no, but I could not stop them. What made me more vulnerable here was Al started to treat me differently. He hated that the fact I let other boys hold me and kiss me. I tried to impress him by drinking and being clever but he still didn’t like me as much. One night we were having a party with loads of men. I agreed to go into the bathroom with one man, because he said he wanted to talk to me away from the noise of the music. In the bathroom he pinned me to the door, bashing my head when I tried to get away. Suddenly I realised how small I was; I had no chance of fighting. I was trapped in there and no one answered my screams; they just turned up the music. Someone did let me out but the incident scarred me. After that I stopped saying no. The abuse escalated until I was being passed around half a dozen men, almost every day. Over a week it could be twenty different guys. My body wasn’t ready for it and I bled constantly, another thing they made fun of me for. They had other girls, too. None as young as me, mainly girls from 13 to 18 years’ old. I did not know if I could leave. And even if I did, there was no place that I could go to hide from the men. They lived in my village, and knew where I would go. I did not think that I could get away from them, and even if I did my only other option I had was to go back to that crippling loneliness so I convinced myself that the abusers were my friends, an illusion I still struggle to fully discard even now. One of the perpetrators would leave me covered in bruises where he pushed me against tables and the worktop. Worse were the constant criticisms. For me, it was a treat to be allowed to use someone’s towel; usually I was told I was too dirty to touch their stuff. Being allowed to just sit and play a video game or watch telly was enough kindness to make me cry. The violence got worse as did the emotional abuse, continuing until I was 13. The worst incident was being kicked down the stairs by someone who had always been gentle with me – it was so unexpected but, at the time, I thought it was fair because I had refused to sleep with him. By then the men had tired themselves of me; I was drinking heavily and had lost the innocence that they had found attractive. […] The authorities didn’t know that this sort of abuse happened. They were on the lookout for international trafficked victims. On one occasion, I was arrested for assaulting a police officer – no one asked any questions, like why I was drunk at 9pm or followed up after I was released from custody. […] When I dropped out of school, I was given other options, mostly distance learning. I had little contact with social services despite being out of education. I feel that any young person who isn’t at school should be an immediate red flag, especially if, like me, they showed violent behavioural traits. Why didn’t the social services ask what I was doing, all them hours? I think this was the major point when they could have stopped me getting deeper into the situation […] Even now I struggled to see myself as a victim. My abuse was mainly emotional and I never ended up in hospital. Yet all the published cases involve crimes what I feel are far more horrific then my own. I never knew what happened to me wasn’t a choice; I never knew I was abused. If this crime was published in all its brutal honesty rather then dramatised for TV with “key points” like a particular beating, other girls might realise, just because they aren’t being drugged, battered or held prisoner, they are still very much a victim. […] At 18, I went to the police regarding a separate incident. When prompted I told the officer about other incidents, but was treated with total disregard. They said they would have a look, see if the offenders were still at the same address but they never followed up or got in touch with me again regarding this. At the time of disclosure, I was informed there were little grounds to prosecute. I was made to feel I could push, if I wanted to, but they were very clear that they would not back my case and saw it as a waste of time and resources, not even noting the names or dates I gave. As such I had little faith in the likelihood of a positive outcome for me. Also, going to court without the safety net of a likely conviction would have compromised the life I had built for me and my family, as well as expose the truth about my past, which I still have kept very much hidden. Yet another factor was, and is, that I struggle to recognise certain “nice” perpetrators as abusers, and am very uncomfortable with the thought of putting them in prison. Some of them were young people themselves, pressured into abusing me by older men. In these cases the abuse was rarely continuous; they were ashamed and didn’t want to do it again […] Working with Sophie Hayes Foundation has made me see that every day is a journey. It is the little things that you must remind yourself to be proud of. For me, I have many small goals I am working towards.  I am in the early stages of my very first healthy relationship. I am proud I have finally said no to violence. This summer, I have the confidence to wear whatever clothes I wish to. I am proud I feel safe in a skirt or shorts – I know I have the right to dress how I chose now. Another goal I am working on is accepting my past and not hiding it from the people I love for fear of their opinions. A few weeks ago me and my boyfriend were watching a movie when a rape scene came on. He held me while I cried. I had a panic attack but I am proud that I had the strength to tell him the reason for my tears. This shows not every day is a good day but I am proud that I am working through it. I am a mum to a beautiful son, I have a job I love, and I study. I am going to university in the near future. I am proud that I can say my future is my own: I will not be dictated to and controlled anymore. I am learning to be strong and I am learning that I am worthy.

Ruth,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Eastern Europe (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is Ruth and I come from Eastern Europe. I was forced into the sex industry after being tricked by a friend. I managed to escape from it with the help of a man, but was tricked again by him into being his own personal slave. I met somebody else during this time, even though I didn’t feel like I could trust him, I felt like I have to get out and he was my only escape. I am glad I did it as now we are happily married and he is the best thing that happened to me. I remember like it was yesterday when I first got in contact with SHF. I found Sophie’s book at a petrol station, picked it up and finished it in 3 hours, crying all the way through. At the end of the book I saw all the contact details, but I was too scared and embarrassed to call, so D, the man who saved me from hell (now my husband) did it for me. I can’t find the words to describe how good SHF has been with me, how much they’ve helped me, encouraged me, made me believe I am worthy and that I AM NOT ALONE! It has been a long journey to get where I am now. The whole “healing” process has been painful, but there were lots of happy moments and now I can finally say I am happy, very happy! From a scared, frightened girl I can say I became a secure woman. It took me more than 2 years to realise that I can take decisions for myself, I can decide what to wear, where to go, I am a little bit more open in meeting new people without being afraid that they will know what I’ve been through and they will judge me. Recently, I became a manager and this is when I knew I’ve got my CONFIDENCE back! I still get horrible nightmares and wake up screaming, but now I know that THEY CAN’T DO ANYTHING TO ME ANYMORE! I AM NOT AFRAID OF THEM! And you should think the same: “THEY” CAN’T TOUCH YOU! This note of hope is for you, so you can see that you are not alone and you can succeed. It does exist, life after all those horrible moments and it does exist happy endings, it’s not only a fairy tale. And you need to know that YOU ARE WORTHY and you are THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN YOUR LIFE and you ARE FREE and nobody can take that away from you, never!

Kate,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (trafficked from),Europe (slavery location),"Having someone to actually just listen to me and talk to me and have time for me has been the best thing ever. It’s extremely lonely and having someone give me the time has meant I’m finally doing something with my life. Otherwise, I’d still be sat on my sofa doing nothing. All I wanted was someone to understand and just have a bit of time. Instead I was just left because I don’t make a fuss. Actually just human contact: It’s all I wanted really and I didn’t get it. Now I have someone who actually checks I’m alive every now and again has helped me cope. Even if we don’t talk every day, I know I could message them and they’d reply. I feel like I have someone there for me. They’re patient with me as well as telling me how it is. It’s the best privilege ever and I feel very lucky. A lot of good things have happened since I left the situation I was in. I’m at university now and practically things are going well. I have somewhere to live, something to fill my time with, a group of people who check I’m okay and I’m building up a collection of personal items again. But I still find things difficult even though it’s been a year now. It doesn’t just get better just because it’s been two weeks or two months. I find it hard to look people in the eye, I don’t like being in the house on my own, I’m finding it hard to make friends, I couldn’t think of anything worse than a relationship, I feel really uncomfortable making decisions for myself and I don’t sleep well. I don’t feel confident and I feel ashamed about what happened. Moving on is a lot harder than I thought and I feel a very different person to the person I was before. But things are better than they were. And I hope one day I will feel as important as other people and I hope one day I will start to feel safe again. Hope has become really important to me and it’s one of the things that gets me through each day   Narrative provided by The Sophie Hayes Foundation in their report ‘Becoming Hope: Stories, Reflections and Recommendations about Trafficking and Slavery Aftercare in the UK’."," There are an estimated 3.6 million people living in modern slavery across Europe and Central Asia (GSI 2018). This region had a prevalence of 3.9 people in modern slavery for every 1,000 people in the region. Men, women and children are trafficked in to forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the most widespread for of modern slavery with an 84% of victims trafficked for this purpose. The majority of those trafficked for this purpose are women and young girls who often originate from Eastern Europe within the EU as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority of people being trafficked from Nigeria to various parts of Europe including Italy, France, Spain and the UK through an array of complex trafficking networks. Kate grew up in the UK with little support from her family. At the age of 18 she went to university, but hated it and soon left. She took up an invitation from a man she had gotten to know through an online forum to join him in Europe for a holiday. Once she arrived, she was locked in a room and forced in to prostitution. For over a year Kate was forced to provide sexual services, her passport was locked in a safe, along with the money she earned for him each day. One day, Kate was able to escape. Taking her passport and some money from the safe after having memorised the code, Kate bought a flight back to England and once she arrived, went to her previous social worker’s office who called the police. Six month later, Kate reached out to the Sophie Hayes Foundation saying she wished to be ‘normal’ again."
Lam,"",Forced labour,Vietnam (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was 16 years old when I came to the UK. I'd left home the year before after my father died in a motorbike accident. My family were very poor and lived in a small rural town in central Vietnam. My father's death left my family with money problems and my mum started to borrow money from local loan sharks. She encouraged me to get a job so I left school and started working as a newspaper vendor, but my salary wasn't enough to support my family. Slowly our family got more and more into debt, and the loan sharks started to threaten my mum. We had heard that it was possible to earn lots of money overseas so me and mum decided that I should go overseas to work and send money back home. We told the loan sharks what we were planning and they put us in contact with agents who said they could arrange the journey for me to go the UK. The agents arranged false travel documents for me and I left Vietnam with a group of other people going abroad to work. We flew to the Czech Republic and then hid in trucks from there to the UK. The journey was awful, I was threatened by the people in charge and saw other young people being assaulted and raped. They told me I wasn't allowed to contact my mum or speak to anyone else. There wasn't much food available and little access to toilets. When I got to the UK a man met me and told me he was going to help me find work. He took me to a house full of plants and told me that my job was to look after the plants. He told me I had to stay in the property at all times. Every day, someone would call to check up on me and sometimes visit to make sure I was doing a good job. I slept on the floor in a corridor and lived on food parcels. I remember asking the man who took me there if I could leave because I didn't like it but he threatened to beat me or starve me to death. After 5 weeks the police raided the house and arrested me. They told me that the plants I was looking after were cannabis and that I'd been helping to grow illegal drugs. The police charged me with drug offences and I was sentenced in court to 18 months custodial sentence in a Young Offenders Institute. I had two solicitors to help me, one was trying to get me out of prison, and the other one was trying to help me stay in the UK. I wanted to go back home, but I knew that the money I owed to the agents and the loan sharks meant that my life was in danger. I was worried about my mum, but couldn't contact or help her from prison. The entire time was really scary and confusing. A lot of professional people visited me in prison, including Fiona* from the NSPCC Child Trafficking Advice Centre (CTAC). She asked me lots of questions about my life and said she was writing a report to try and help me. I left the Young Offenders Institute after 12 months. A social worker helped me to live with a foster carer, who I stayed with until I was 18. I was told that because I had been trafficked into the UK I could stay for 3 years, but after that I would have to ask the UK government if I could stay longer. With help from people at CTAC and other agencies I began to understand what had happened to me. I was invited by CTAC to join a group to meet other young people who had been trafficked out of their countries. I now understand what trafficking is and I use my time to help the NSPCC support more children who have been abused like me. I know of other people who have been trafficked into the country but who have returned to work for traffickers after their arrest. They work despite the risk, out of fear that their families will be harmed if they do not work to pay off their debts. I'm not in contact with these gangs anymore, but I'm still scared of them.   All credit is given to NSPCC Child Trafficking Advice Centre -nspcc.org.uk/ctac   Narrative can be found at https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-we-do/childrens-stories-about-abuse/gracies-story/        "," There are an estimated 136,000 people living on conditions of modern slavery un the United Kingdom (Global Slavery Index 2018).

Gracie,"",Children Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location) Central Africa (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Central Africa (slavery location),"I was born in central Africa and had a happy childhood. My family had a farming business and we lived comfortably in the suburbs of a town. I went to school every day and loved my education. As I was growing up there was a lot of political and ethnic tension in my area. My life was shattered when I was 11. My family was killed by rebels one day when I was at a friend's house. Neighbours in the local community took me in for a while and looked after me but soon an older man claiming to be a friend of my family came to visit. He said it wasn't safe for me to stay there and that he'd look after me. He took me out of my country by road to a neighbouring country. He left me with a woman in a house with lots of other women where I was made to have sex with older men. Sometimes it was 3 or 4 men a day. I was scared and didn't know where I was. When I was 12 years old I was pregnant and taken for an abortion. It left me with abdominal problems I still live with today. After the abortion I was sent back to the brothel. When I had healed I was made to have sex with the men again. I'd lived in the brothel for 2 years when a man called Abasi* took me away. We travelled on a plane to London. I didn't know then but my passport was false, giving me a different name and date of birth. The immigration official believed I was a 21 year old woman. I was just 14 years old, in a foreign country where I couldn't speak the language. Abasi took me to a city where I was locked in a room in a brothel. There men would come for parties and would rape us. There were many other girls living there from all over the world. We were locked in our rooms during the day and made to bag up quantities of drugs. In the evenings, men came for the drugs and to have sex with us. I tried to run away once and was caught and brought back. The guard beat me really badly in front of the other girls and I was told if I did it again, he would kill me. I believed him. I was sexually assaulted and physically abused there for a year before I managed to escape. I didn't want to die, but knew that nothing could be worse than the life I was living. During one of the parties I saw an open door and ran for it. I ran for 2 hours in the middle of the night. I could only speak a little English and didn't know where I should run to. I was 15 and alone in a foreign country. I managed to come to London and was told I should try and claim asylum. The immigration officials took my fingerprints and matched them to the passport I had been given to enter the country. They believed I was 22 years old rather than 15. I was placed in temporary immigration accommodation and then arrested by the police for document forgery. I could not believe what had happened and felt the abuse had begun all over again. The police charged me and sent me to an adult women's prison. There, staff recognised I was a child and arranged for me to have a solicitor and I was released to a hostel for adult women who have been victims of sexual exploitation. My solicitor also introduced me to the NSPCC's Child Trafficking Advice Centre (CTAC), who have been an amazing support. With their and my solicitor's support I have successfully challenged local Children's Services view that I'm adult and lying about my age and abuse. They have helped me to find a safe place to live. My CTAC social worker has been there to support me dealing with my ongoing legal issues and threats of deportation. They have given me the emotional support I needed to feel empowered to go back to school and continue to recover from the horrific abuse and exploitation I was made to suffer. In return, I've worked with the CTAC team to support other young people who have been through a similar experience to me. I'm continuing to live with the effects of what happened to me. I've been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and memory loss. I'm outraged that I still have to defend myself from the accusation that I've invented my abuse and trafficking. I'm just glad CTAC have been there to defend me through this experience.     All credit is given to NSPCC Child Trafficking Advice Centre -nspcc.org.uk/ctac   Narrative can be found at https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-we-do/childrens-stories-about-abuse/gracies-story/  "," It is estimated that there are over 9.2 million people living in conditions of modern slavery across Africa, with 101,000 of these in Central African Republic (GSI 2018).

Grizelda Grootbroom ,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,South Africa (trafficked from),South Africa (slavery location),"My name is Grizelda Grootbroom, erm I grew up in Cape Town, the Western Cape in District 6 and in that we met a lot of people that came through, and I made a friend that came from a normal household, a normal environment. She was just one of those girls who would go out clubbing and she used to hang out with us. She left for Johannesburg to go and study at UJ, and then I turned 18 and the state offered houses, like ok well you’re 18 now and you didn’t do much with your life while you were here, where the opportunity, and you gotta go because it’s too overcrowded.  And then I remember her being in Johannesbury and I called her up and I said look things are really abd for me and I really want a change. You know Cape Town, I don’t wanna be here anymore, and I just want to be out. Do you see where we stay can you help me out and you know your parents are great and you enjoy it and you probably have your own place can you help me I promise I can I will do anything and she said yeah of course and, you know, come through, get yourself here and you can do that. And I got to Johannesburg a day and a half later, in Park station. She picked me up and I was so excited to see her because she was a friend to me, that’s one thing I knew. Erm, she let me in the house and just walking through comfortably and she’d like this is gonna be a room, it looks very very empty, and I was like ok, you didn’t hook me up with anything or something? And she’s like well this is Jo-burg you can find something in two days’ time. And I said okay, I’m just gonna pass out for a minute and get some rest, and she’s like oh okay cool, no problem. Um, I felt safe, I felt okay, and I said okay, and that was the last time I saw her. In there a couple of hours, it didn’t take long, a couple of guys walked in, erm. First thing I felt was a punch in my face which really shocked everything in me. But not the punch, but I think I was confused. What’s happening? And the more I felt confused, the more smacks and kicks and punches I got and while that was happening I was being undressed. In my mind the only thing I was thinking was, where is she? What’s going on? The more more more I thought about that the more I went numb. In my mind I mean I just say her, I was getting angry and angry and angry. But the more I got angry the more I thought I was getting helpless because they tied my hands up and they undressed me. Then they covered my eyes with cellotape and that’s the only sound I had in my head That was it. And then for a couple of two weeks, all I could do was smile and hear the sound of money and men coming in, but I don’t know how many in a day. That went on for about two weeks because I counted days, and then was exchanged with another, a younger girl. When they grabbed me at my neck and dragging me out around the night, and they kicked me out. And she was still screaming I could hear, she’s being punched too. I got in the street and I was completely dirty. I didn’t think about going to the police station because I smoked like drugs. First place I went to was in the truck area, did what I did there, sexually. For me it was just to get drugs so I can get away from the pain and anger. So at the escort agency I was working at in Port Elizabeth, I was pregnant with Summer, I was pregnant Summer for about six months, and then they said it’s not acceptable, and so that forced it into abortion. And as I laid there, seeing my unborn baby’s legs in a sink, I just knew something was going to change. I was held in the house for two weeks, but it held me in bondage for eight years. My so-called friend used the money for me being trafficked for her university and education. This person I see them all the time, and they see me all the time. They see the work I’m doing all the time. So now I work for an organisation called Embrace Dignity. The word really captured me on ‘dignity’. Erm who’s embracing my dignity? And so I wanted to find out what they do. So I go ahead and find a lot of fulfilling when I tell a story or my story. I think the most fulfilling part is when people really have heard the story and come back to me and say thank you so much, I mean, you have said something that really helped me. It might not have been on human trafficking but it really opened my eyes that it could happen right next door, and it could happen right with me. So it’s a very very beautiful organisation just going back and feeling safe in the organisation, and knowing that your, my dignity being restored.   Narrative produced and provided by Trulife South Africa    "," There are an estimated 155,000 people living in modern slavery in South Africa (GSI 2018). South Africa remains a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking. South African children were recruited from poor, rural areas to urban centres, such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, and Bloemfontein, where girls were subjected to sex trafficking and domestic servitude and boys are forced to work in street vending, food service, begging, criminal activities, and agriculture. Local criminal rings organized child sex trafficking, Russian and Bulgarian crime syndicates facilitated trafficking within the Cape Town commercial sex industry, and Thai and Chinese nationals often organized the sex trafficking of Asian men and women. Nigerian syndicates dominated the commercial sex industry in several provinces. To a lesser extent, syndicates recruited South African women to Europe and Asia, where some are forced into prostitution, domestic servitude, or drug smuggling. Grizelda was 18 when she moved from Cape Town to Johannesburg on the promise of a friend she would have somewhere to stay. However, upon arrival, Grizelda’s friend took her to a house and after she left, Grizelda never saw her again. After a few hours, men began to arrive. Grizelda was subjected to physical abuse and forced in to prostitution."
Ramesh,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),Four years ago my wife had severe pain in her abdomen and the local doctor advised us to consult a doctor in the city. I had no money for my wife’s treatment so I took a loan from the slave owner after being advised to do so by some of our relatives. Just after my wife returned from the hospital the slave owner and his henchmen caught us from our home. They put us in the brick kiln with our 3 children where we all worked 12-15 hours everyday. We got Rs 200 (about $2.80) per week and that amount was not even sufficient for food of entire family. We were living very terrible life in the brick kiln. We were illiterate and weren’t able to calculate our wages. One evening Schools4Freedom team members came to the brick kiln and listened to our story. They helped me to negotiate with the slave owner. I got my due wages back with the support of S4F team members.   We returned home safely.   Narrative provided by Voices4Freedom Narrative can be found here," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India. While the bonded labour system is formally abolished and criminalised, recent research indicated that bonded labour is still prevalent in India. A 2016 report found that in the state of Tamil Nadu, 351 of 743 spinning mills used bonded labour schemes, otherwise known as Sumangali schemes. Similarly in granite quarries, wage advances and loans with an interest ranging from 24% to 36% are used to bond workers. Situations of debt bondage are often aggravated by the need to raise emergency funds or take on loans for health crises.    Ramesh took a loan to pay for his wife’s medical treatment. Upon their return from the hospital, Ramesh and his family were forced to work long hours in a brick kiln to pay off the money they had borrowed. Ramesh and his family were finally able to escape their situation with the help of Schools4Freedom."
Setsofia Dowokpor,2016 (Narrative date),Forced labour Children,Children,Ghana (slavery location),"I lived and worked against my will for five years, under my master. I wake up at dawn and work on the Volta Lake until dusk. [Setsofia recalls how heavy nets often get knotted at the bottom of the lake] I don’t like going to remove it, it is dangerous and people usually get injured. If she [his mother] knew she would not survive even after selling me off, I think she would not have sold me out to be forced to work against my will in exchange for the money she received in advance. [After his release Setsofia received counselling and reintegration support] It is an obvious dawn of a new day, full of better opportunities and expectations in my life. I am grateful to International Needs for all their efforts to eliminate child trafficking and combat other forms of slavery.   Narrative provided by Free the Slaves "," There are an estimated 133,000 people living in modern slavery in Ghana (GSI 2018). Ghana remains a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, artisanal gold mining, quarrying, herding, and agriculture, including cocoa. Research focused on the fishing industry on Lake Volta indicated that more than half of the children working on and around the lake were born in other communities and many of these children are subjected to forced labor; not allowed to attend school; given inadequate housing and clothing; and are controlled by fishermen through intimidation, violence, and limiting access to food. Boys as young as five years old are forced to work in hazardous conditions, including deep diving, and many suffer waterborne infections. A study of the prevalence of child trafficking in selected communities in the Volta and Central Regions indicated that children from nearly one-third of the 1,621 households surveyed had been subjected to trafficking, primarily in fishing and domestic servitude.  Setsofia’s mother was suffering from ill health when she arranged for him to be trafficked to a fishing village along Lake Volta in a desperate bid to get month to treat her illness. Setsofia was just 8 years old, falsely promised an education and that he would only work part time. However he was forced to work day and night on dangerous fishing boats with little food or rest. International Needs Ghana, an FTS partner, visited Setsofia’s childhood village to talk about the need to keep children away from hazardous work and to urge slave owners to release their trafficked children. As a result of this outreach and pressure, his slave holder freed Setsofia August 12, 2016."

Worsening political and economic conditions throughout the country have exacerbated already high levels of instability, insecurity, and political tension and rendered populations more vulnerable to trafficking. Some men, women, and children working in artisanal mines in eastern DRC are subjected to forced labor, including debt bondage, by mining bosses, other miners, family members, government officials, and armed groups. Some children are subjected to forced labor in the illegal mining of diamonds, copper, gold, cobalt, tungsten ore, tantalum ore, and tin, as well as the smuggling of minerals."
Sophia,"",Domestic slavery Children,Children,Tanzania (slavery location),"I became a child domestic worker when I was 14. I completed primary school in my home district, Nzega, and I passed the exam to go to secondary school. Then my father got sick with HIV/AIDs and my mother couldn’t pay for me to go to secondary school. I just stayed at home. Then a relative told me that someone was looking for a domestic worker, and told me that I could get paid 30,000 per month (£10 per month). My employers didn’t give me a contract though, so I had to start work at about 5am and I didn’t get any chance to rest until late at night after everyone else was sleeping. I was working for about 17 hours each day. The man of the house wasn’t too bad, but his wife was very cruel to me. If she wasn’t pleased with my work – which was quite often – she shouted at me and insulted me. I had to work for several months without pay, and I had no way of communicating with my parents. One day I left the house to go to the church and find my relative, who suggested the job to me in the first place. They came back with me to my employers and told them that they had to pay me for the time I’d worked but they just said they couldn’t. They only paid me for a few of the months, and they refused to let me leave. I finally managed to persuade them that my parents were very sick, and so they let me leave. I went to another relative nearby, and he recommended that I visit Agape (organisation founded by a former child domestic worker who had been supported by the previous Anti-Slavery project, now Anti-Slavery’s partner organisation). When I went there they were very helpful, and I was admitted to their school. They also pay for my health insurance, so I don’t have to be scared of what will happen to me if I get sick. I don’t want other children to become child domestic workers like I was. My dream is to become a teacher so I can educate children, and help encourage them to stay in school. I am happy now. I can communicate with my family, and sometimes my uncle visits me at church. I finally feel like my life is on the right track, and I have hope for the future.   Narrative provided by Anti-Slavery International "," There are an estimated 336,000 people living in modern slavery in Tanzania (GSI 2018). Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims’ family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in domestic servitude throughout the country and in sex trafficking particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with Kenya. Sophia was 14 years old when she became a domestic worker. Forced to work long hours with no rest, Sophia was subjected to verbal abuse and her pay was withheld. One day Sophia was finally able to leave her situation and contacted Agape, an organisation supported by Anti-Slavery International. Sophia is now rebuilding her life."
Lauren,2018 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"He said that I would make $20 million from the documentary, and that I was… if porn was legal, then escorting and prostitution should be legal too. And that once it aired or whatever, that I would – and all the other girls – would get $20 million each. When I met them I was senior. I was a gymnast and I was doing gymnastics. I wouldn’t say I was a shy person in high school but I didn’t really talk about relationships or anything and so I just kind of when on there to meet people and possible find a relationship. Who knows? I can’t remember what she really, like, said exactly. But I know she was just friendly and kind of pursuing in some way. That she was a nice respond and actually genuinely cared and wanted to get to know me. At first they treated me very well, David bought me things and bought coffee and just treated me like a friend, I should say. Like a good friend who you would think was a nice person. They took me to like hotels and stuff just for fun at the beginning. I just thought that ‘Oh, I’ll have a lot of money and I’ll be around people who cared about me’. I just thought that sounded great. Maybe a month after meeting them, it kind of got to the point where they slowly introduced the whole escorting or prostitution phase – whatever you want to call it. I think I was kind of just in shock and I didn’t really know what to think of it, and I just wanted to be cared about and I wanted a person to care about me and to be loved. So at that point, I just didn’t really know what to do. I think it was five or six months after living with them, in November of 2014, I erm called my mom. She obviously jumped on it – was like ‘Oh, you want to come home, great!’ and she knew that I needed to get out of the situation. They were not there at the time so that’s how I got out. They had scheduled some man to come over that night. But I had decided before that person comes over that I was gonna get on it and actually leave. So that’s was I did.   Narrative provided by FBI.gov"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Lauren was a teenager when she was tricked in to prostitution by a purported movie producer who said she would be able to make $20 million. Lauren was trafficked across the country and was not allowed to keep any of the money. "
Vidya,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I live in my father’s native place. My two children are young, one is 3 and the other is a month old. My father was a daily wageworker and I continue to do that too. Neither of us have ever owned land. I’ll continue to work hard and make good decisions so that I can develop and own my own land. I think I’ll get to that point in 10 years from now. Once I’ve developed I will go and help the others to do the same. My community works hard and everyone takes care of one another. The castes don’t just serve their own but the whole community. Since we all take care of each other there is no need to call the police or complain. The police treat people equally, it may be different in other villages.   I go to work whenever I need money. In the past I worked because my family needed money. My father worked and then I worked for the same landlord after. Father never received an advance, the landlord would give him around 1,000-2,000 each year. My brothers were able to go to school because I worked. One completed 10th and the other 12th standard. When we were younger we feared our teachers even though our landlord said we could complete up to 2nd standard. Now do all sorts of jobs with a variety of landlords, so there isn’t one employer that I regularly go to. I end up working maybe 15 days a month. There’s more work when it rains. If a landlord likes me he’ll ask me to come back the next day I’ll only go back if the landlord treats me well. I do all sorts of small jobs like pulling grains and taking care of cows. We don’t have anything formal setup on how much I’ve worked and how much I need to repay. We both keep track in our minds. Four times a year my landlord would get in the field with his son and four other laborers. Even though the landlord’s son went to school, he continues to work on the farm.   No one uses the word bonded laborer, we’re all considered daily wageworkers.1 It’s probably because all of the authorities are pressuring farmers. The man that I currently work for is a good man. There are some rumors that he mistreats his workers but that’s false, those stories come from outside people. He treated me like family, though I didn’t take coffee or tea, I never entered his house. I learned so much from him and now I believe I can perform well on my own. I decided to leave because I had gotten married. When I told my landlord he was okay with it because I had been a good worker. I had worked for a total of 12 years, 3 years with one landlord and 9 for another. I think 50% of landlords treat their workers well, the other half don’t. Landlords need workers more than the workers need these laborers.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

My first daughter is studying at 4th standard, my second daughter is in 2nd standard, and my son is in a pre-nursery class. I never got an education but the government had a program for illiterate people to learn to write so I know how to write my name.    I currently am farming and working as a daily laborer. My father was also a farmer. I own half an acre of land and took a lease for another acre from my previous landlord. The land belonged to my father and he passed it down to me. My grandfather and father were both bonded laborers but for different families. I worked for a different landlord because that family wasn’t taking bonded laborers at the time. I need to take a loan to start building my house. My grandfather actually died in the house of his landlord. Nowadays people are developing so bonded labor is going down. Both my father and me are done with bonded labor. My father stopped when I was born. However he eventually went back because he needed money for his health. Landlords were not giving him money to cure his health.2   I started bonded labor when I was 13 years old. I took 300 rupees for 1 year of work. After that I continued with the same landlord. Over time I got paid 13 rupees per day. There were times when my landlord would give me 1,000 rupees for longer periods of work. I worked as a bonded laborer until I was 22 because my family paid of my debt. They decided it was time for me to get married. They paid 2,000 rupees to get me free.

Atal,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My village taught me how to write my name. I never learned how to read or write properly. I sent my three children to school. They each got a formal education even though my two sons are now in bonded labor. In the past my family struggled to have food to eat. My father was a bonded laborer. In my fathers time there was so little food that the landlords didn’t even have enough to feed laborers. It was a hard time. I had to take care of my father since no one else did. My mother wasn’t feeling well either. My caste is Madrigah, the lowest caste. I’m not allowed to go into the house of an upper caste. When they give me food I take it outside to eat. The caste system that I am in is “unfair and bad”. I fear that I’ll get beat if I try to enter in an upper caste house. “But we are also human beings, they are also human beings.”1 It’s a bad thing that these rules are there.   When I was 9 years old I had to work because my family did not have any food to eat. Children couldn’t get paid in money so we got food in return. My landlord would only offer me cloth and food. Even if I think it was unfair now, at the time it was an inevitable situation. As a continued I worked for one landlord for 6 years and the second one for 10 years.   It is almost impossible for a bonded laborer to pay off debt. They have so much debt and no food to eat so they become bonded laborers. But there are continuous problems and people end up taking out more loans. They can only get out of their situation if the government lends a hand. That’s the only way a bonded laborer could pay off their landlord.2  We call landlords sokurey3 (wealthy man). My landlord was not a wealthy man but he still gave me food. As a bonded laborer I didn’t work for money, I just got food. The government gave the landlord two acres of land. He farms a lot of different crops. He gets his water from a borehole from the government to assist him. I got my land 10 years ago and am paying it off to the government little by little. I can only pay when I get profits from my crops.  I have worked for three landlords for a total of about 15 years, one was abusive and beat me. 4 My landlord was a nice man, and I wouldn’t file a case against him.5 My landlord threatened me and asked why I filed a case against him. He said he has given me food, nurtured me, and gave me life. He was angry and I didn’t know what to do. I never want to be a bonded laborer again. All bonded laborers are hurting. I fear that if I go back to that lifestyle that I’ll continue to be threatened and that I won’t be able to live freely. “We (daily wage workers) have freedom.  Independently we working and earning money now. And in those days we were like slave, we were suppressed by the people, we used to listen according to their terms, that’s why we don’t want this life.”  I believe that my words are valued and that people listen to me in my community. I once stood in an election as a member but lost by one vote. My wife then ran and won in her election. There are too many people you have to talk to which makes elections hard. I had to run for my people. Those government people “used to deceive us, people use to do unjustice to us”. I worked as a bonded laborer and I want to give justice to the people, that’s why I ran.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)    "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Bekal,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was about 14 was when I joined for bonded labor. I took sheep for herding and at night I would supply water. I would go to sleep at 1:00 and at 3:00 my master would wake me up to do more work. He had many cattle and buffalo that I needed to clean up. My caste is SC/ST, there is only one caste in our village, but there are multiple castes in surrounding villages. When I was 16 years old I went to night school for five years in order to learn how to write and read. That is when I started working for bonded labor. I got married and now have three daughters and one son. My eldest daughter got married, my son is also in labor as an agricultural worker, my next daughter is ready to be married, and my youngest daughter is 17 years old. My son-in-law ran in an election and won, he’s now in a reserved seat.  I make sure to vote at all levels in elections.   My father who has passed away was a laborer, he took land for leases and rented land. I currently have one and a half hectares of land where I grow groundnut. Three of my children assist me with the agricultural work, my wife is unable to work because her legs are not able to support her to stand. She stays in one place from time to time. We do not have any bonded laborers working for us, only some daily labors who come from time to time. I don’t have the economical strength to keep any bonded laborers. It requires at least 15,000 rupees to keep a bonded laborer. If I had that money I would utilize it for something else that I need. Farmers cannot be lazy, they have to work well physically.   I don’t think I’m well off, but to some extent I am running my life. I have about 40,000 rupees of debt at the moment. I got this debt from buying a new black court, I then sold my ox and bought something else. I owe money to a couple people in our village and then a person from another village. My interest rate is two rupees, I’ve had this debt for eight years now. I haven’t been paying any principle amount but I pay in trust.     I spend all of my time in my field to do work. I worked as a bonded laborer for a few different landlords. I worked for two different people for 5 years each and then 10 years for the third person.1 I still see them everyday around the village, I keep relations with all but one landlord. Once I turned 24 and got married my father gave me some oxen to sell so that I could pay off my debt. At that time I was working for 80 rupees a year. I work day and night without any rest because I want to be able to look after my wife and children better. I work hard because working hard will get me out of these problems.   My first debt was 1,000 rupees and then took two other loans for 5,000 rupees. I took other small amounts here and there but my family told me not to take anything else until I was able to repay the amount I owed first. After I got married I went to the next landlord’s house for bonded labor. I took a 10,000 rupee advance from him. I had to give the landlord my new conditions. I told him that I would only work during the day because I had to look after my wife at night.   There are three different types of landlords. One type is mean and hateful, one just doesn’t care lets their laborer sit outside, and the third type is loving. 2Among the four landlords I worked for there was one that beat me and threatened me a few times. This happened when I was young. I went and complained to my father, after that people told the landlord not to threaten me in the future ever again. I was treated well for the remaining time with that landlord and my future landlords. There was one master that I called by name, at night he would teach people to read and write but would never take their money because he saw talent in people and wanted them to learn. People were affectionate to him because of that. Because I was young I think my master did the right thing by beating me because it trained me to do well. This was how I was able to train my son.3 I need to beat my son in order for him to learn certain things. Nowadays he doesn’t like this type of training.  The new generation of farmers in this area must keep bonded laborers because they wanted to keep their children in school to study. I know that there are laws against bonded labor in India. Some landlords in this area still continue to do it. Some of these landlords still call me for daily labor and I go whenever I’m able to. Whenever I was sick some landlords would give me 10 or 20 rupees to go the nearby hospital, my other landlord who treated me badly would tell me that I had to work, even when I was sick.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Bhagwan ,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I have worked so hard, it is now time for me to develop my land and take care of my family. I worked as a bonded laborer for 8 years. I was paying off debts that were from my marriage. We had to work so much, our landlord wouldn’t send us home so I wasn’t able to go home to see my wife and children. I had to get the extra money because we were poor. I knew what I was getting myself into. My debt had to be paid off and I always knew how much I owed. I was willing to work extra time if it meant that I would get the money I needed. My work was solely farming. He had 30 acres of land where he farmed tamarin trees. My landlord wouldn’t pay me sometimes because my earnings would go directly to my debts. When I had 5,000 rupees left of debt I became a coolie worker where I paid off the rest of my debt. The pay was 25 rupees a day. I worked for about 2 years to repay the debt.   The taslidar came and told me to not work as a bonded laborer anymore. When they tried to talk to my landlord he said I couldn’t leave because I still had a debt to pay. Later JEEVIKA came and took a picture. They asked my landlord why he continues to cheat these people. It wasn’t until JEEVIKA came that I was able to leave my situation. However it caused tension between my landlord and JEEVIKA. I’m not sure how much detail I can actually go into1. This all happened about 20 years ago. I’m now 50 years old so it’s been a while.   Honestly leaving bonded labor has changed my life but landlord’s behavior hasn’t changed. When I filed my case I didn’t feel bad. I remembered all the bad moments and knew that it was time to go. My landlord always tries to get me to come back and work for him. I don’t feel obligated to. I worked hard and he treated me poorly at times. I remember the harassment that I received, so I don’t feel bad if I don’t go to work. I know the landlord feels bad that’s why he’s always trying to give me work. He does get mad at times though. I must begin to make a good life for myself.   When we were poor we needed the landlord to give us money. That was the only way I could get money to get married. Now the landlord pays daily wageworkers more money so that the work will get done.

Irfan,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My father never put me through school even though he was healthier than me.1 Now my two sons are both in school, they’re 15 and 8 years old. I got sick a while ago and had to borrow money and that put me in bonded labor, it took me 20 years to pay off that debt. During that time I had to pay for food and my children’s schooling. I’ve been working off my new debt for about 7-8 years. I’m currently in 15,000 rupees in debt and am still working to pay it off. I don’t really know how much I am repaying because there is nothing that tells me how much I pay off each year. My landlord will give me money here and there. If I ever want to work for another landlord I’ll have to give my current landlord the money I receive, about 80 rupees a day.   If I die before my debt is paid my son will inherit the debt. My landlord doesn’t give me any specific amount or time before it’s paid off, I just work continuously and time goes on. My landlord keeps records of my debt on a piece of paper. I paid off 10,000 rupees in 10 years. At that time my landlord gave me food and clothing. I was getting paid 5,000 rupees a year. Now they pay me 8,000 rupees a year but I don’t receive food or clothing. I like that I’m being paid more even though it’s taking me longer to repay my debt. Throughout all of this my landlord remains the same and I call him the owner. He had the same attitude before I was in debt. He treats me respectfully and if he didn’t I wouldn’t work for him. I work for him because my life is not running well.   No one in my community has power but we don’t fear anyone. I don’t know if there are any laws against bonded labor. There are tensions because the younger generation doesn’t respect the dominant people. We have small conflicts here and there. Landlords will sometimes threaten the laborer for not working well. We respect people who run for election, we only request for them to give us something.  I wish to go back to the olden days, when we got things for a cheaper rate. In the olden days we never used to apply chemical fertilizers. Now they’re very strong and food becomes chemicalized. It’s not good enough anymore but we still continue to eat it.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Kishan,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I’m 25 years old, I’ll probably get married within the next two years. My brother and I take care of our parents because my father is blind and my mother stays at home. With two sisters and two brothers we take care of one another as we all live in the same village. My parents are busy paying off loans and my sister’s wedding. I only went till 2nd standard in school my brother went to 12th standard so he makes a lot of decisions for me. Since my sisters had to get arranged and we had family problems, I needed to find a way to make money. My siblings and I are doing better than our parents but we still must work hard.   We have about 4 acres of land that my parents bought and then passed it down. We don’t make a lot of money on our family farm. The crops sell we have a good rainy season. Our cotton sells at a range of 12,000-30,000. The farm used to make us money but now we end up paying for a lot of things. Since my brothers and I share the farm we share the profits with each other. If our crops continue to not do well I will go back to the landlord to work. Right now we sell rocky and cotton. We’re hoping that that the rainy season comes soon since these crops require lots of water and we don’t have a bore well on the farm. We planted cotton five years ago but since it doesn’t frequently rain in our village we have to wait. There aren’t any employees working on our land so we take care of it ourselves. My brother and I worked on our family farm since childhood. My other brother works as a bus conductor. My final brother isn’t working right now because of treatment that he got some years back.   The government helps some people in our village, but not me. My brother told me that the government gives some people bore wells, but I don’t think there are other types of assistance programs for people like me1. But a month ago some people came to release me out of bonded labor. My brother takes care of all those government paperwork types of things since I really don’t know about it. He also makes a lot of decisions for me. From what I understand the papers that were given say that I am no longer a bonded laborer and that the government will compensate me.   Prior to that my landlord would allow me to bathe and have food at his place. I wasn’t allowed to go to other places. When I first started I took a one time 10,000 rupee advance, which I’ve cleared working around 2 to 3 months in the landlord’s farm. In a year I pay around 20,000-30,000 that goes towards my loan. I felt that this was a fair amount to pay off. People call me when I don’t have work and will ask me to come to their farms and I get daily wages. However my landlord scolds me when I do this and says, oh I have given you money, why aren’t you coming to my farm2. My landlord is a well-known person in our village. There are only good landlords here. I call my landlord brother and he calls me by my name. I’m offered coffee with the same cups that they drink from in the kitchen, except I drink it outside of the house.    I worked everyday throughout the whole year but got breaks during holidays, weddings, and other events. If there were times when I needed to borrow money my landlord gave it to me. He still keeps track of how much I’ve borrow and writes how much I have to pay off in a book. He also writes down how many days I’ve worked. I watch him write in the book inside while I stand outside. We never signed any formal paper because it’s based on trust. I believe my landlord is telling the truth when he says how much longer I have to work, he’d never try to cheat me.   It was in my own interest to stay on my landlord’s farm. I never had to go back and forth from my home to the farm. I went home once every three days to take a bath and sleep. I’d also go home for a couple days if I had a fever or felt sick. Daily wageworkers would leave and sometimes not come back the next morning. Other landlords would try to get them to work on their farms, convincing them that they’d pay them so much to work. If I need work I will return to his farm as a daily wageworker. He was a nice man who always helped me when I had a problem, he gave me good advice and encouraged me to live a better life.    Today my landlord tried to call me and said that I have 2,000 rupees left of debt to pay off, but I know that I am done. I’ve told him that I’m not going to come and work. Even if I go give him the money he will ask me to work, he has to take my money because he won’t get both money and work from me. Being a bonded laborer has brought pain into my life. My family was poor and didn’t have enough food to eat or clothes to wear. I’d have to go out, ask a landlord for money and then work for a long time. I’ve experienced this pain and never want to relive it again.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Lal,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I have a good life; I have good health and a family. I have 4 sisters and one brother the other has passed. I have been married for 3 years and have a son who is 2. My father is sick and old. He is so sick that he’s unable to go to work. He found himself in bonded labor after borrowing money from a landowner. He cannot work now because his body is tired. The landowner arrived at my house asking who would pay off the money he owes. The landowner shows me a piece of paper that is confusing and I don’t understand what’s on it. He only tells me how much money my father owes and where he needs to work. I don’t understand the situation. My mother tells me that my father and the landowner got into an argument once. They negotiated that my father would owe 60,000 rupees. Nothing was written down prior to this. There were no official documents saying how much my father borrowed or how long he would work. They have documents now but the landowner holds onto them. My father has worked to pay off 40,000 rupees. His debt is now mine. The landowner is now called landlord. His name is Nagesh.   I am not angry at or resent my father. “What has happened has happened” and I will pay the debt. My life will improve once the debt is gone. I must also work as a daily wageworker in order to take care of my wife and child. God has a plan for my life; He knows that I am a good man because I have worked hard. Having to pay off my father’s debt is not a punishment from God.   On Nagesh’s land I farm the sugar cane, bananas, and other crops on the property. He is a fair landlord. However the daily wageworkers are treated better since he knows they can leave at anytime. He gives them extra rupees so that they’ll stay. The daily wageworkers can go to another landlord and get their wages at another field. I am committed to his property and cannot leave.  Work ends at 5pm but my house is 3 hours away, so I get home at 8pm. The landlord used to live in my village but moved farther in order to own larger property. People ask me why I continue to work for Nagesh. I’m not allowed to work somewhere else and pay him with the money I receive. I must pay off my father’s debt by working on his land.    I am aware of the laws. You are allowed to go to the police if your landlord is not treating you well. The police will take your landlord in.  I promise to never turn Nagesh in. He is a good man. I know other landlords that treat their workers poorly. Nagesh will ask me how I am doing and if I am feeling well. He brings tea and coffee to all his workers. It is never served on the dishes from his house. I wish he treated me like family but I know I am paying off a loan. I hope to pay off all the debt by next February.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Mahendra,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My son is two years old. He requires an operation on his heart because there’s a hole. The operation costs around 70,000 rupees, which I can get if I work for JEETA. I initially will pay 40,000 rupees and then the rest will be paid later. NREGA is also an option but they don’t pay enough. We never went to school so I want to make sure my son is healthy so that he can eventually receive an education. My wife watches our son at home.   Before that he was a servant, he didn’t get paid for his work, he was only fed. He wasn’t able to start saving money until he was married. Once he married he became a daily wageworker. My father has been in bonded labor for 6 years. Earlier in his life when work was slow as a daily wageworker he would take credits from others to take care of his family. The credit became bigger and bigger. Eventually he had to find a way to pay it all off. Now my father and I are both in bonded laborers and work for different landlords. I had taken 2,000 rupees initially for yearly expenses but my mom asked me to take some money so I took out an extra 10,000. The landlord gives me a 5,000 rupee advance each year that is enough to feed my family for the whole year. I currently have 70,000 in debt. This year I’ve started paying off debt without taking on more. As I work my landlord he keeps 20,000 which goes to paying of my debt. I need to pay off all my debt to my landlord. I need to make sure that I do work and not anything dumb. Around my landlord I make sure to behave well to both him and the other workers. I don’t believe that we need to treat each other like family. The landlord and worker should simply treat each other respectfully and fairly.    Landlords will continue to rely on laborers to do their housework. They also need laborers to farm and take care of cattle. There are a lot of jobs that landlords need workers to complete for them. Being in bonded labor worker may be better than a daily wageworker because the landlord has to pay a daily wageworker everyday compared to a laborer.    We never went to school so I want to make sure my son is healthy so that he can eventually receive an education. My wife watches our son at home.   Being elected in politics won’t help you. People there just end up working and won’t get any benefits. We hope that they’ll maybe one day help our people but that doesn’t seem to happen. There’s no other group that help us. 9 years ago there was one group called VJ Bank that gave loans but since people never paid it back it stopped working.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)    "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Manoj,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"Laborers have to take things into their own hands if we want to see things changed. The landlords will not do anything about it. There are rules that are set by the government and other groups. These groups stop the landlords from expanding to other facilities. There is a national law that landlords are not able to use their laborers for missions. These kinds of laws support laborers and not the upper castes. My landlord initially followed the laws, but when he didn’t he would come and ask me why I had reported him. It was because when I was working I did not know the jobs I was doing. In spite of knowing the laws, my landlord continued to make me work.1 Other small groups are trying to stop this kind of stuff from being done in rural nearby towns and cities. We do not have a lot of water because sand has no water that can percolate into the earth. Yet people were trying to transport all of the water to the cities. This could become a great problem for us. People in the most rural areas are educated about this kind of stuff, we learn about the water situations through the newspapers and hearing about the local schemes.       Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Naik,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"In the past 10 years I haven’t received any benefit from the government. I don’t work anymore but before I was tilling and did general farm work. I have around 0.4 hectares of land. My farmer had four people working for him and so he distributed the land amongst us so each person got around a half hectare. I always worked on the farm but I would go to work at other places here and there. My son now works for daily wage and he was able to go to school. The biggest changes we’re seeing are that people are getting paid 200 rupees for their work.   I started working for my landlord because my father received 500 rupees from him. My sister was married at that time but I was still single. After working as a bonded laborer I got married. Even after bonded labor the landlord came to my house and I worked as a daily wageworker. I would go to work during the day and come home in the evening. My landlord’s son died less than 10 years ago but it’s been a while since my landlord passed away.   I’ve worked as a bonded laborer and daily wageworker. For around 10 years I finished my father’s bonded labor after he died. My father sent me for bonded laborer when we didn’t have food and so I had to work. I did bonded labor for two or three people. I’d work in different places and would get transferred around. Because of that I was able to get some livelihood. It was better to work as a bonded laborer, to be working under someone. When I transitioned to daily wages various people would ask me to come work for them.   I liked working for my landlord because he treated me kindly. He would bring us coffee and would tell us to drink it and then continue working. In the past they would never do this. You don’t want my father’s history because in those days they used to only eat on leaves, they would never get plates. Now they are giving from the same glass. I never entered his house but nowadays landlords invite people into their house. We don’t enter because it’s bad luck. They are serving people in the same glass because they realized if they don’t and scold these people they will file cases and create legal problems. The elders in the upper caste are advising the younger generation to serve their laborers from the same glass and plates they eat on. They also say not to scold them or anything. Landlords think that if inequalities continue with untouchability then the labor class will create problems for the landlord.1 This is why they’re treating laborers in a softer manner.     Government policies are changing because lower class people can approach the police station. Policies are being brought into force and that makes the landlords and upper class people afraid.       Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Obaid,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I fear that my sons will never come out of bonded labor. One is twenty two and the other is twenty five. They only went to school up to third and fifth standard. Once they stopped they went to bonded labor. I have no way to pay off the loans. There is no way out. I’ve been working in bonded labor for 25 years and I think my sons will have to do the same. My younger son owes 40,000 and the older owes 45,000. Both loans were for their marriages.  I am now 60 years old.  I worked for many different landlords. I’ve been working for this landlord since February. I will keep working until I pay off my loan. I don’t know if I’ll be working for the same landlord next year. If not I will work for a different landlord, paying off the debt I still owe.  I am paying off a 25,000 rupee loan. I originally owed 45,000 rupees but have paid off some of it. I don’t know how much longer I’ll have to work or how much I actually pay back the only thing I remember is the extra money I’ve borrowed. Right after I took out my loan the landlord was forcing me to repay. He said, “I want money no matter what you do”. But I didn’t have the money so there was nothing I could do. I had to go to another landlord and take out a loan to pay back the landlord who was forcing me to pay him back.  My landlord wants me to be loyal and polite to him. If I speak nicely to the landlord he will speak nicely to me. Sometimes the landlord will speak rudely to me if he’s in a rush, but I continue to speak kindly to him. The landlord and I call each other by our names but I never really greet him. I only speak to him when I need to know what work needs to be done. My landlord respects me. If I run into issues I can ask the police for help but I have to pay them first. Everything that I do benefits the landlord. “Landlords are profited by this system because the money which they gave us it will be returned back to them”1. I will repay my loans but will eventually have to borrow money again from another landlord. I can only work for my landlord and cannot go elsewhere to earn money to repay him. If I try to work somewhere else he will send people to find me and bring me back. Once my son left to work somewhere else and the landlord got six to seven people to come to my house asking me where my son was. My son left because he had a fight with the landlord. But my son must pay off his debt.   My sons use MNREGA but I’m not sure how much money they get. The government doesn’t really give us anything. I can vote but I whoever I vote for won’t do anything to help me. Five years ago my brother won a place in the general seat election for president in a village one kilometer away from me. He couldn’t help my situation because he was uneducated. Because of that he wasn’t given power. Educated people in congress would make decisions for him. He won the election because people ultimately wanted to use him. Politicians do their job for the money.   My village is filled with people who have loans to pay. There are 15 people in my village and 100 landlords. We all owe money and have to work. But if the women go out to get daily wages there will be nothing for me to eat when I return home. I have to work hard and my children have to work hard too. Maybe then we will be able to improve our lives. Every week my village comes together and brings the money we’ve earned. It’s a small amount. One guy will collect all the money and “pay it off” to the landlords 2. Everyone in our village will continue to work to pay off loans. We’ve been doing this for a year and we are paying off our debt. I think my life will start getting better in five years.   Good will come to me so I continue to hope. God is the reason for the good and bad things that have happened in my life.  I hope and dream that I will pay off my debt and that my kids will earn daily wages to live a better life. I don’t care if my landlord knows this.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

I know they get signatures in other villages because my brother had to do it. Since I’ve been in this village for a while I know all the people here. We’ve built trust with the people around us.   My landlord now is a nice guy. He calls me by my name. Nothing is wrong with him. He’ll give me money if I have nothing to pay off. But when there are emergencies he’ll give me money to take care of my health and my family. Those monies go to a separate account sheet that the landlord keeps track of. I earn 200 rupees a day to work at the same landlord’s farm everyday. He demands that I cannot leave. There are other workers on the farm, about 10 a day. No one had lodged a complaint because we’re all very happy.1 The landlord treats us well even though I have taken his money and am still paying it back. He continues to treat me like a servant but that’s ok. He’ll offer me coffee and tea that I take outside of the house. I drink out of a steel cup, different from the ones that are inside of the house. The landlord hardly scolds me. He won’t scold me when I’m sick or have to take care of my children. he only gets mad when he finds out that I need to go out to do work for another person.   About 10 years ago some people came and told me and bonded laborers that we didn’t have to do these jobs anymore. They said we can get out of bonded labor telling us that they could get us trusts and accounts so we could start making money for ourselves and families. Nothing ended up happening. There’s a man in another village named Shiveresh who is trying to end bonded labor. He believes that we shouldn’t have it anymore and is beginning to release bonded laborers one by one.   At the end of the day my future depends on God. There’s no guarantee in life and so we must treat everyone good.      Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Ram,2018 (Narrative date),"",India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I am 45 years old, and I still have energy. I need my energy so I can give food education to my children. I am married with two sons and one daughter, they are 11 and my two sons are 8 and 6 years old. They are all in school, the youngest is at a nursery that is run by the government of India. I didn’t get an education because I wanted to work in order to earn food, our elders think this way too. I was in bonded labor but now do daily works.1 My father was a bonded labor and did jobs here and there. When you have a family there are a lot of expenditures and as a result we get some debt. I took my first debt 20 years ago for 30,000 rupees. I have paid a good portion of my debt but there still some remaining. I have about 15,000 left to pay off. My grazing sheep and goats allowed me to pay off 3,000 rupees, but there was a period of 10 years where I was not able to pay off any of my debt. I was able to pay off parts of my debt before I was married. Being married increases my expenses. The debt I owe is to one landlord, I also go to other landlords to find work when I need it. My landlord does not get mad when I go to other places to find work.2 He understands that I need to pay off my expenses.   People in my community will call their masters uncle or mama, we use affection when talking since we have relationships with them. My father called his master uncle. My current master is older than me so I call him uncle, but if he were younger I would call him by his name. He is in the bovie caste and I am part of the goola community.3 In the olden days our caste would do herding and farming, now we go for daily works. I do not feel that I am an influential person. I don’t know who has power in my area, I don’t think about these kinds of things. I only vote in elections on a national level and vote for whoever people tell me to vote for. I know people from our caste and others who have stood for an election. In our community no landlord wishes to get rid of bonded labor. Landlords do not think getting repaid is not as important as making sure that there are laborers working on their property. Bonded laborers also have to be away from their families for long periods of time since they are always in the fields. I do not think this will last. Landlords are paying their laborers less and less yet landlords expect them to work on their property. Laborers demand more money but don’t get it. So, I don’t think this will stay. Landlords are starting to now only give out small loans, like around 5,000 rupees. Yet they still make the laborers work on demand throughout the seasons. People don’t want to work as a bonded laborer anymore for these reasons.   My grandfather had 20 acres or so of land and he distributed it amongst him and his 3 brothers. At the end all of them sold their land. Economically, I am doing better than my father. In his time the wages for bonded laborers were really low and life was not good. I think that the way landlords have treated their bonded laborers have remained the same, even till today. Landlords respect their laborers even if their debts get larger and they continue to ask for money. Sometimes landlords will try to demand laborers for their money. Once my landlord did that but I explained my position to him and as a result he stopped asking me. Back then there was no talks for compromise, now landlords and laborers find ways to talk and create low interest amounts. My interest rate is about 2 to 3 percent. I work equally as a bonded laborer and daily wageworker. If I ever refuse to pay my landlord he will tell me to go to the last place that I worked and pay him with the money that I earned there.   Things are different with my landlord. I take tea in his house, with the cups that my landlord uses. Sometimes I have to refuse to go to work for my landlord because I have already committed to other work for that day. When I tell my landlord he just says to come back to him tomorrow. If I am free I will go to his house and tell my landlord that I will work in the field so you can go and take a rest. My landlord also had to work his way up and once had to work on his own. He understands what the conditions of laborers are.4 My master treats my family and me good and understands us. He is different than the other landlords. We never really have any conflicts, just small problems here and there. Things are peaceful here, things are dealt with in a quiet and internal manner.   Currently as a daily wageworker I make 150 rupees when I go out for work. I work around 4 to 5 days out of the week. In a month I make anywhere from 1,000 to 1,800 rupees. It is just enough for me to pay for my family’s expenditures, but we actually would need around 6,000 rupees. Our wages go up only during seasons where the demands are high. I stopped doing bonded labor 15 years ago. I worked for the same landlord when I didn’t have debt, when I was a bonded laborer, and now for daily wages. He has remained the same throughout all three of these situations. I know I still have to repay the rest of my debt. I have to repay what I owe. Paying off my debt gives me satisfaction and happiness.   I will continue to work hard and hopefully in the next five years I can uplift my family. I will save money for our bank accounts. Maybe one our children will get into government departments or jobs. I want my children to continue to get better education. I pray everyday to our family god.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Uday,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My master gives me his phone number, that’s normally what will happen. You can take his number if you want to call him. My father lived in a different city than the one we’re in now. I live here because this is where I got married and settled down. Two of my daughters are married but my two younger sons are not married yet. I’ve been working as a laborer since I was 12 years old. I don’t have any ideas about education and we don’t really have any food to eat. My father did not go to school either. My father and I didn’t do agriculture work we cut trees and sometimes do construction work where we mix cement. I leave at 4:00 am to start daily labor. I work one week out of the month. I make sure to work because when I need food I have to lie to my landlord and tell him that I’m sick or have a stomach ache.   My caste is SC/ST, my father never owned any land so we always had to work. I don’t know about any bonded labor laws but I don’t think they would work. Whenever there’s a law about one person benefitting in particular people deal with it themselves. There are these middle men in politics who always go around trying to get fake signatures and reach us on our phones. In politics farmers and landlords are not treated the same. My landlord tries to vote with intention so when he does that the politicians come and talk to him. These politicians will tell the master to leave the laborers. That ruins all of the work they were trying to do. Politicians do take money and deceive people. Landlords make money off of their laborers so they never try to deceive their workers. I make sure to vote in national and local elections. I don’t favor a political party because they come to our villages promising goats and sheep but never return with anything.   My master used to have more bonded laborers but now it’s just me. I started working for my current master when I was 18 years old. I’ve worked under several masters since then. I had five brothers and five sisters when I started working. There was no way for me to survive without going out for bonded labor. I was the second brother. I started bonded labor because my father had me take up his loan. I took cattle and buffalo out for grazing. I was paid 5 rupees per cattle per year. My father’s loan was for 150 rupees over the course of 6 years. After I had worked the 6 years my landlord made some sort of false calculation and compelled me to work for another year but I refused. I told my father and so him and the elders gathered surrounding people to get justice. They calculated it and told him that I had done my bonded labor and that I even did three months extra. They tried to come to an agreement but ended up just dismissing it.   When bonded laborers approach a landlord for money he doesn’t just simply give it. He will get a one stamp paper and will write an agreement. He writes everything and says that I can find anyone who knows how to read or write to see the agreement. Both the laborer and the landlord are supposed to sign it. In the process they also make two copies, one is for landlord and one for the laborer, the master doesn’t sign either paper. Sometimes I will ask for a third copy for someone else to have as a witness. My second master didn’t ask me for any promissory note, he just had a notebook where he would write how much I had given him and the debt I still owed. He gave me 250 rupees per year as well as whatever I needed such as clothes, food and everything else. I worked a total of 6 years for him. Each year the amount I got increased 100 rupees. If I work hard for my master and remain committed, he will pay me more wages. But if I work hard and he doesn’t, I will go to find other work with landlords who know how hard I work and are willing to pay more.   I did not sign any sort of contract with my current landlord. I used to take debts not on the basis of a promissory note. No one opens that story anymore. It’s been so long and that system has been eradicated. No one can force somebody to work, but it’s surprising that this is all gone. been 12 years since I started working for this landlord. Whenever I need money he will give it to me, but he does not pay daily wages. Once a year he will give 2 to 3,000 rupees, but nothing more than that. Whenever my landlord asks me to work, I work. If he doesn’t call me I go to work somewhere else. I must make all of the important decisions in my life but God decides everything and we cannot know it all. I must continually work in order to get food. When the work is there, we go to work on all that needs to be done.   We don’t have land, we don’t have a borewell and we don’t have money to invest. If my father or grandfather were wealthy my life would have been better. But who knows what will happen. In another 10 years I know I won’t be able to perform any heavy duty work so I’ll have to do some sweeping here and there. How can I expect things to get better if we don’t have land or those kinds of things? I would like to remain with my current master and take food and other little amounts here and there when I need it.   I never went into any of my master’s homes to take tea or water. From a middle age I never did that. I have restricted my brain and my heart. God hasn’t given me the mind to want to go into landlord’s homes to take those things. Entering into the home of an upper caste is a crime to the government. We are lower caste you know, they don’t allow us to enter. Landlords feel an aversion towards us because bonded labors eat like buffalos, cows, and sheep. We eat like all these things so the landlord will say “don’t enter into my house”. That kind of stuff doesn’t make me angry. If I get angry people may think of me as a rude fellow, someone that is not good.   I haven’t registered anything about bonded labor but I do have a BPL card. Nowadays everyone can drink tea with common glasses and go into hotels. There may be laws on the government side against bonded labor but there is no law on the side of society. In society nowadays there are tons of things going on, no one is even called by their caste.     Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Yogendra,2018 (Narrative date),Debt bondage,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was very scared of my landlord. Before I was released I lived a different life. I didn’t know what freedom was and didn’t know what would happen to me when I worked.1 I’d feel scared when it was time to eat and I went outside. Before my landlord came to this village he lived in Dubai for a long time. The landlord’s father stayed here before, he was a good person.    I was making 200 rupees a day and worked four days out of the week. I was able to get out of bonded labor from a broker who came to visit me. He asked if I liked the work I was doing. He then told me that another landlord could pay me 50,000 rupees and would give me a hectare of land if I worked for a year. I said yes but was only paid 37,000 rupees. I signed a blank paper to give the landlord so that he would pay me the full amount.2 When I tried to go to the landlord to get the money he said he would give it some other time. It troubled me because I wasn’t getting it.   I was working in the fields one day when the landlord threatened me and said he had gave me all of the money with the blank paper I signed. He’s threatening me now saying that I owe him money. He’s asking me for 50,000 when I didn’t even get that in the first place. He demanded that I give him money because he was lending money from somebody else. I didn’t have the money because I was taking care of my children. At the time I was living in a house my landlord owned. He said if I didn’t give him the money in three days time that he’d go to the courts and take his house back.    Now my landlord can’t get anyone to do work for him. He really has a bad name and no one wants to go to him. He has cheated a lot of people and now he can’t afford to find others to do work. People told him that he should treat his workers better. My landlord holds an old mentality his behavior and attitudes are not right. He would only give me money and nothing else, not even tea or coffee. He never offered me help when my wife got sick. I never even got to come inside of the house. He always told me what to do, yelled at me and never respected me. One day I was going to teach him a lesson for mistreating me.3He says that I should be grateful that I’m able to work on his farm.    Once the police was here and my landlord said in front of him that he’d pay me, but again he didn’t. The landlord says he doesn’t need me to work for him and that he doesn’t need other laborers so nine of them have already left. Things continued to go on and at the end of my labor the landlord would say that everything is okay and nothing was wrong.   I needed money so I borrowed from other people in my village. My father owned two hectares of land. I have two brothers and we all work. Before this I was working for another landlord, but he was a nice man. He never caused me trouble and we were able to settle. He gave clothing to my children and paid for their school fee. He was a really good person, I worked under him for two years. I was paying off a loan from my sister’s wedding. I’ve raised complaints about my landlord to the police. The police probably won’t help me though. They don’t represent the people they’re only supportive of politicians and those who give them money. I had a relative who won a general seat in the election. When my landlord was abusing me I told my relative in government. He told me that nothing is free and that he’d try to help me even if I didn’t have money. I just had to be quiet about it.   In my life I make decisions that are the best for my family. Even though I’m working under someone now I will try to make my life better. I will never go back to that landlord because I know the trouble he has caused me. Less and less people are in bonded labor because they want to live a free life, they don’t want to listen to a landlord. People want to work and pay for things on their own. I’m able to talk with others we are able to share our problems and what we want changed. I have to find strength on my own to keep going. When I think about my kids I know I can give them a better life and so I continue to work hard.   My landlord knows that he will face consequences. Ever since I left I think my landlord has realized the mistakes he made, I know that he feels sorry for what he did but he’s also very stubborn.    Narrative provided by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Telling Stories: What Competing Narratives about Slavery tell us about Emancipation (forthcoming)  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Gowri,2016 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"I am not so worried about my own future but my children are my sole concern. A mother who neglects her children, is no mother at all. We thought it was a normal job. To us it didn’t look like bonded labour. Many women were working for him. They told me that he was a very bad man. I didn’t believe them then. Even if you want to extract labour from someone, be reasonable about it. Pay reasonable wages the them. Don’t abuse or threaten them. There was no one to protect us. I used to wonder if someone would rescue us from him. I prayed a lot. My children rushed to me crying. They said, “He had hit us because you didn’t work for them”. In my anger, I confronted him. “Why are you beating my children?” He then came after me and hit me with a log. I felt very pained. [crying] When he hit me, the courage came to fight back. If we are right, there is nothing wrong in fighting back. Justice is on our side. When I called IJM over the phone they came to meet us. They reassured me. “Don’t worry, Gowri. We will definitely help you”. Had IJM not come, I would not have been a mother to my children. I am very happy. I’m even happier that my children are studying. They are learning. They are happy. I want them to become doctors and teachers. I want them to work in a good environment. In freedom, I am happy and at peace.

India has a population of more than 1.3 billion people, with at least 270 million people still living on less than US$1.90 per day. Existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, with forced labour, including debt bondage, constituting India’s largest trafficking problem. Situations of debt bondage are often aggravated by the need to raise emergency funds or take on loans for health crises. Sometimes entire families are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, embroidery factories and agriculture. Gowri and her husband wanted to support their children and pay for their medical bills, so they took out a loan from a factory owner, agreeing to work in his brick kiln and wood-cutting facility to pay off the debt. This turned out to be a trick, and the owner continually increased the loan, violently forcing the family to continue working long hours for him. Even when Gowri paid of her debt and tried to leave to find a safer workplace, her employer attacked her. This abuse continued for nearly 10 years, until IJM was able to send rescue.

So they weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, you know. Erm, also she, the woman that, I’m speaking to myself again this is kind of hard. Alright. The woman that touched me, when I was ten she flipped it around and told them that I touched her son, and I was only ten years old, and so the law enforcement got into it. And my brother, one of my older brothers, he was my lawyer his name was Arsenio, and he really was there for me at this point in town. He was my favourite brother you know. I couldn’t have contact with this kid, and this kid was my childhood friend and he was only one year younger than me, you know. […] Erm so during that time, it was about a couple of years, and they were still going about, it was like a two or three years process, my brother was a lawyer and erm at this time I didn’t know my brother is that way, you know. And he used that, because of me being vulnerable and he used that to molest me and have sex with me and raped me. […] Yes my own brother. And he, ‘til this day we haven’t had contact, we actually just recently had contact about a couple of weeks ago. I messaged him and I told him that I forgive him, you know. During through that time there have been a couple of other incidences that I have been erm either drugged, you know. At the age of 15 got touched by my friend’s dad. Well at a young, especially at a young age after this I deal with low self-esteem because like I lost my virginity to a woman not by choice and I lost my virginity to a man not by choice, and I was already confused about who I was. I knew I was different because I like the same sex. […]  I was about, you know what, I kind of always knew. But I kind of, it was probably high school and everyone telling me that, oh you’re gay. And I’m like, what’s gay? My parents were really sheltered, especially with my dad being a minister, and so I didn’t really understand what was, what that mean, you know. Until I was like, you know, after that when I found out what I was I kind of fully embraced it, but just not to my family, because my family was very shameful towards some stuff like that. and people, I did get made fun of, I did get bullied in high school, erm.. I… there was a… I did start using… My grades were good, my grades were good all good until I came out because a lot of the bullying and stuff, I started skipping school, smoking weed, you know. I got kicked out of high school, I’m from Rochester, Minnesota, and I got kicked out of high school there and I went to another school but there I was just smoking weed and I went to these, I went to Spring Valley, Minnesota with my friends for the weekend, this was when I was just starting to be rebelling against my parent and just take money out of my mom’s purse. There was one thing I did that it still to this day it hurts my heart, that I took my parent’s first wedding rings when they got married and I pawned it for money to go get weed. And it just still haunts me to this day, and I was in Spring Valley and I was drinking and drinking, just to hide the paint because during this time I was still 15 erm, my brother was still touching me and molested me and raped me every chance he got. And he wanted a relationship with me, he wanted me as his partner… my own brother. And he, their dad, I was really drunk and I vomited everywhere, and I was laying on a counch and their dad, my friend’s dad. I’m sorry that I’m all over. But my friend’s dad gave me this drunk and I couldn’t feel my body after this, you know. And he starts to unzip my pants and pull my pants down, and I remember someone comes in like ‘what the fuck are you doing?’ and then he’s like ‘nothing just checking if he’s asleep’. So then after that I think the guy knew what he was doing, so he left, and they both left and I remember passing out. That’s all I remember. […] There’s another one that I remember… and this is during drinking and drugging, because I am in recovery and I am, I’m recovering alcoholic addict, I have 6 months sobert actually yesterday. […] But erm, when I was living in Rochester, there were a couple of friends that I went to, and they had this gay friend in their, downstairs part of their apartment, and they, I forget his name I think it’s like Patrick or something. And like, we used to party there and he always had a thing for me and I just wasn’t really feeling him because I had a boyfriend at the time, and like, I just… he said, we started to run out of alcohol and like as an addict we just wanted more and more and more. And so he gave me these pill and he was like ‘it’s just alcohol in a pill’ and I took like four of them at a time and then next thing you know I just, I don’t remember. Like I just passed out and I woke up and I was completely naked, you know. I’m laying, laying over the bed while he’s in me, you know. But I, I came to while he was in me. And I freaked out and the thing that he had given me was Ambien. And my friends had left me there and went back to their apartment and just left me there for him. And I never went back. And I told my mother and she was like well you should have never been there in the first place, she, my mom and my dad aren’t very, well mostly my mother isn’t the most supportive. […] It confused me, like you know, even to now it affects me. Before I even transitioned like, I’ve only been in trans for a year, and it’s been the most happiest time of my life. But during the time as a gay man, I struggle with that because I wonder if like, if I’m this way because of him, or am I this way because of, erm I was born this way, you know. But I’ve come to terms, sometimes I do go back and forth, but I’ve come to terms right now that I am Maya, and Ashton has, I like to say that Ashton is part of my past life, he’s not here no more. […] I haven’t had any issues about going to the bathroom. I haven’t, but there’s like, my anxiety when I go to church I’m like, I’m very religious, I’m a Christina but when I go to churches I feel like I’m gonna get kicked out of church. Erm, or like just my parents, you know, they still call me by my birth name which I don’t, or even just walking down the street people go ‘what is that’ or ‘what are you?’. And I just tell them I’m an experiences, you know. I, I am, I don’t even use trans I just say I’m a woman, you know. Like I, I come, I’ve come because of so much hatred towards me, like even before I was trans there was a lot of hatred and a lot of like, during like due to drugging and drinking, there was a lot of abuse. But there was one big thing during my abuse that kept me sober for a year and a half, and I did relapse and now I’m back on track, I relapsed for like three weeks and I’m now back on track. And it was, I went, I didn’t identify as male or female I was just gender neutral, and I dressed predominantly like a male but I still liked men. And I went to Faribault, and Faribault is just a whole, I can’t even go there, I can’t even go through that town after this because it’s such a traumatic event. But like people were making me prostitute for my body to get them drugs, in Faribault Minnesota. And I started getting drugs and one day I stood up for myself and I was like I’m don, I can’t do this, you know. Because this woman that I called mother, because me and my mother weren’t on good terms because I was out them on methamphetamines for a good year, actually a good two years. I was out there on meth, and erm I’m a people pleaser. I put other people’s needs before I do, that’s just how I did, and that’s how I am. […] I was get them drugs, sell my body to get them drugs because, this person who I called mother wanted me to. And she would guilt trip me in to selling my body. […] There were some other people, my boyfriend at the time, that’s how I was introduced to her was through my boyfriend at the time. He’s in prison right now but erm, he’s my ex, thank God. But, she would, her cousin, there would be other girls, you know some underage girls. […] I would travel to the cities too. I would travel to like Austin, Minnestoa, Albert Lea, I would go to Stewartville, I would go to La Crosse, sometimes I’d go to Iowa, I would go to many other places just to exploit. And like I’d have it right there and I’d have protection, that’s all they promised is like you had to pay for your protection and make this money and give you drugs and stuff. […] A lot of the times they [the Johns] knew. [They specifically requested Maya] […] I think as a woman figure in general it was more violent because a lot of, either I was a sissy faggot, or I was a gorgeous woman, either way, calling me gorgeous of calling me sissy faggot, they still abused me. Just to get power for themselves, hit me with a sock full of soap or choke me, you know, or just like belittle me like piss on me, or just like, put dog collars and lock me in closets. I wouldn’t even had to have sex that’s just what they’d do. And I would tell this woman like, because she’s supposed to be my ‘protection’, and she’d be like ‘well they didn’t kill you, right?’ You know? And I would tell my mom, I told my mom all this and she said ‘well that’s what you get for putting yourself in those predicaments’. […] Well my dad, he’s, I love my dad with all my heart. They’re separated now. He’s been there through all the treatments, I’ve been to 14 treatments in my whole life from 17 to 23. And this is my last one, I just graduated treatment today. Erm and I am done, I’m really done. And I manage a sober house. […] It’s really really hard to separate the two [addiction and prostitution] because like it’s prostitution, like since I’m so used to the excess since I was like 17/16 you know. Because like, especially if you’re young. If you’re a young gay boy or a young trans woman, they love young. It’s disgusting how they want them younger, you know under age as I was. And like how I used to get in to bars and clubs because I was underage. You know, I’m not supposed to, but people would get me in just to have sex with me, or have me dance through the poles. Me and my sister, we used to travel together and do it. We wouldn’t have sex with each other but, for money, you know. And she said, she’s a trigger for me. It’s hard, to this day, it’s hard for me not to go out there and make that fast money and not erm… but now I have a normal job, I work at Psycho Suzi’s but it’s really hard for me like to be there. Because it’s like I could get money so quick, just by walking outside, you know posting an ad, or you know. […] With fast money, there’s fast consequences, and they’re not good consequences, they’re horrible. There’s this one time when I like I said, when this is what made me really get sober. It was in Faribault erm, I was in, I knew a whole bunch of dope guys and they’re all Nazis, and the dope ran out and I went and sold my body. I was like, I’m done, I’m sick and tired of this, I’m exhausted. I’ve slept with like, I usually like slept with like 10 to 15 men or women a day, you know. I was just, my body was exhausted, I hadn’t taken a shower in a couple of days because I was just having sex after sex after sex. And thank goodness I’ve never gotten, oh I have gotten, I have had an STD but it was last December. […] but during that time when I had an STD, and they locked me in a room full of faeces, dog faeces, and put a collar on me for 3 days. And if I tried to leave, they had like a rolling pin and brass knuckles with knives on it and there were six of them and they did jump me at one point, and I was so scared. I was stripped down to my underwear, that’s all I was wearing was my underwear and I had to down the rain gutter to escape and run for my life. This was during the winter time and I was all in my underwear and I called my dad and he came picked me up and he brought me to detox. And that’s when I was like I can’t go back. I can’t go back out there. I told them please, just like put me in jail, put me somewhere because if I go back out there I’m gonna go back to the old habits I was going, Prostituting, drinking and drugging, you know. Meth is a very sexual drug. It really is. You know along with GHB like those two, it wasn’t even date rape for me anymore. My body was getting so used to GHB that if someone tried to drug me with it, it wouldn’t work because I’ve gotten so, it was tolerance to it, you know. And like it’s really…I’m really blessed to be here and to be alive. And like I just, I want, the only reason I’m here is to spread the word. Like how dangerous this is. I wanted to grow up really fast, and now I wish I can go back and like get to all that time I had back. Because like, each time I had sex with a different john, or tricks, there was abuse it in it. Like constantly. Those stories weren’t even the worst stories I’ve experiences, you know. There’s so much I have experiences, and at a young age that you know, I have to be on meds for. I have to deal with the therapy for. Sometimes like though all the abuse I went through sometimes, some some days are better than others but some days I’m feeling like I’m gonna be fucked up in the head forever because  you can’t unsee those things. Or you can’t undo those thing either. […] I would tell them don’t do it, just don’t. you might think this is the easiest way but the only thing that, the only outcome there is for a fast life, is a fast death. I’m honestly lucky enough to be here. I count every day as a blessing like I said, some days are better than others and some days are worse than others. But my best day sober and not prostituting, my worst day sober and not prostituting, is better than my blessed day high, and prostituting. […] Love yourself. Love yourself. All the things I’ve done, drugging and drinking and having sex with men for money as a trans-woman, just love yourself. And I want them to know that right now, I do love myself right now, I really do. And this feeling, it feels good to feel wanted, and they get that validation from people that you think care about you but they’re only paying for you and treating you like a piece of meat. Its false validation and it’s false self-love. But once you overcome that and find validation in positive ways, and find self-love yourself, and actually love yourself, that you don’t need a man or a woman or money, to validate you.  "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the Unites States.

I was freed from slavery two years ago.  The Arab slave retriever brought Akeen back here a month ago.  He is a good man.  We hugged when we saw each other.  I felt so good.  He’s an adult now!  I gave praise to the people who brought him back.  I was always thinking about him, but I didn’t think we would meet again.  This is by the grace of the Lord. I have four smaller children.  They and Akeen’s father are all here.   Akeen  I don’t remember the South, only that I was abducted.  I am happy to be back here in my homeland.  Life in the North was bad.  The Arabs beat me and ordered me around.  I haven’t met the rest of my family yet, but we will meet tonight.  I am very excited.  We will hug each other and celebrate.  I didn’t know we would meet again.     Narrative provided by Christian Solidarity International"," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people.

I was kidnapped with my parents and my children.  They tried to separate my older children, Agueil Wol and Dut Wol, from me.  My parents tried to hold on to them, and they were shot.  Then my youngest child, a boy named Diing, ran to his grandmother’s body to hold her.  The murahileen hit him with a stick, and he died.  I have no idea where Agueil and Dut are now. I was beaten with a camel whip, and they scratched my wounds with their fingers.  My body swelled up and I was sick.  It left me with massive scars on my chest and left arm. I lived in Abu Meth with Madoi Eyaiya, the man who killed my parents.  He was a militiaman.  He went to the South all the time and came back with cows, goats and people.  I was the only Dinka in his house, but there were other slaves nearby.  I washed clothes, collected water and cleaned the grounds for him.  He beat me.  His wife, Kartouma, was a bad woman.  She beat me too.  If I asked her why, or tried to resist, Madoi would come in and join her in the beating.  I have a problem walking, because Madoi once stepped on my feet with his boots after beating me.  The slave retriever had to bring me here in a cart. There was no church by us in the North, and they tried to force me to be a Muslim.  But I always thought I would come back to South Sudan, so I refused.  My mind was completely in South Sudan. Madoi used me like a wife.  I had one child with him in the North, a girl named Awut.  She’s an adult now.  She was recently forced to marry a Dinka male slave.  Their master’s name is Hamad Hamad.  I would like to see Awut again if she can come back. I have had this ear tumor for more than 10 years.  It is very painful. The slave retriever brought me here.  He gathered us, and placed us in a camp in a small town while he went around collecting other slaves.  It was a good place, and the people there were good.  The slave retriever gave us lots of bread, and sodas.  He worked very hard for us.  If he saw Dinka people in the North, he would go see the owner of the house to try to get them out.

Abuk Alieu Yom,2014 (Narrative date),War slavery Children,Sudan (trafficked from) Children,Sudan (slavery location),"I am from Adieng in South Sudan. I remember that when I was taken, I had a brother named Alieu who was old enough to walk, and my mother was pregnant again. We all went to Catholic church.  I was a member of a group called the “Alleluia Dancers.” I liked church, because I heard about Jesus.  But after I went to the North, there was no Jesus. I was captured near Aweil Town. My family was there to visit the market. When the slave raiders came, my family ran one way, and I ran the other.  I never saw them again. The raiders put me on horseback with another Dinka person, Garang.  There were 5 Arabs with us.  The raiders beat us when we cried, asking, “Why are you crying?” On the way north, we were joined by another group of Arabs, but they didn’t have any Dinka people with them.  Maybe they killed theirs. When we arrived in the North, they sold Garang and me to another man, named Abdullah, who lived in Meiram.  He was unkind.  He forced me to work, cooking and washing the cooking utensils. Garang was the only other Dinka person there, and he was soon sold to somebody else.  Abdullah hit me all the time.  Maybe because I wasn’t his child.  He didn’t beat his own children. Abdullah had a wife, and a boy and a girl, both younger than me.  They were unkind too, but not as bad as him.  His children gave me the scars on my legs. Abdullah renamed me “Hawa.” He didn’t want me to have a Dinka name.  He also called me “abd” [slave] and “jengai” [a racial epithet]. But he forced me to call him father.  When I refused, he beat me terribly. Abdullah sometimes forced me to pray like a Muslim.  But he didn’t take me to the mosque.  He only took his own children.  Then later, in the house, he would ask me to pray alongside him.  He forced me to be circumcised at the same time his daughter was.  During Ramadan, I cooked food for his children, but not for him and his wife, or for myself. I had to sneak food while he was away.  It was hard.  I always hoped Ramadan wouldn’t come. One day, Abdullah brought me two Arab men, and asked me to choose one for a husband.  I cried, and wouldn’t give him an answer.  The next day, he brought a third man, and told me I was his wife.  I forget his name now; he came temporarily and then left.  This happened three different times.  Maybe the men were paying him.  I don’t know. I thought of escaping, but I didn’t know the way home.  There was no way. The slave retriever was the first person to tell me that the war was over.  I met the slave retriever in the village.  He came with me back to Abdullah’s house, and talked with him at a distance.  Then he came to me and said, “We are going.” Abdullah asked me if I wanted to go, and I said “yes.” He was angry, and said, “Why do you dislike me?” I didn’t answer.  I didn’t want him to become angrier and change his mind. I thought, “I’m free!” and I was happy.  I’ve come home to Dinkaland, and I will look for work to do freely.  No one will force me.  I will go to church again. Thank you very much for bringing me back from slavery, for coordinating all this, and for the gifts of a goat and survival kit.   Narrative provided by Christian Solidarity International    "," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people.

Amel Dor Manyuol,2014 (Narrative date),War slavery Children,Sudan (trafficked from) Children,Sudan (slavery location),"I am from Macam Tit in Aweil East County.  I don’t know how old I was when I was taken.  I don’t remember being taken.  I wouldn’t recognize my parents, but I still remember their names. The slave raiders came at night, on horses.  I watched them shoot some of my brothers and sisters, and I saw the rest flee into the bush.  I assume they’re dead.  We were four brothers and three sisters: Adup, Akot, Achier, Abuk, Adut, Akuol and me.  I haven’t seen any of them since. A man named Mohammed Abdullah took me to the North.  He might have been one of my siblings’ killers; I’m not sure.  He and the other slave raiders made us walk to the North.  Nothing happened on the journey.  But the slave raiders cut one person’s throat, and beat two others to death.  The Arab in charge of them said, “I don’t need these people.” I lived with Mohammed in Karega in the North.  I was the only Dinka person in his house, but there were others living with the neighbors.  They were slaves too. Even though I was very young, I experienced serious beatings all the time in Mohammed’s house.  I had to wash their cooking utensils and take care of his wife’s young baby girl.  Mohammed had one wife and two older sons.  They were all unkind to me.  You can see on my left arm I have a scar from a bite, and a burn-scar.  These were given to me by the baby girl I had to take care of, after she grew up.  On my left leg is a knife scar, from Mohammed’s children. When Mohammed saw these wounds, he said, “She’s a jengai [a racial epithet.] It’s no problem.” Mohammed’s sons raped me.  So did Mohammed. Mohammed had me circumcised.  An old man named Abdullah did it.  They told me, “If you join us, you have to be like us.” At first I refused, but I was terribly beaten until I agreed.  Before that, they gave me a new name: Hawa. I was young, so I was not allowed to pray with them.  But sometimes they asked me to imitate the way they prayed.  Sometimes, Mohammed forced me to pray like a Muslim, holding a stick above my head.  Sometimes, they took me to where they teach children about Islam.  I didn’t learn very much there, because I had to spend a lot of time working.  I remember my relatives used to go to church in the South, but I thought that I was a Muslim in the North. My baby is named Kuol.  He is two months old.  Mohammed is his father, and he was born in Mohammed’s house.  Mohammed called him “Juma’a.” As soon as I left Mohammed’s house, I gave him a Dinka name, because “Juma’a” belongs to the Arabs, and I experienced so many bad things at my master’s hands.  When I left, there were no clothes for Kuol, so I picked up this blanket from a rubbish pile on the way South. The slave retriever brought me here.  He came to Mohammed’s house, and told him that he wanted to take Dinka people.  Mohammed agreed.  As I was leaving, he whispered to me, “When you reach the South, escape and come back to me.” But I don’t want to go back.  I’m happy here, because the people are my color. We walked here through the bush, not on a road.  The slave retriever explained on the way, “We are going to Dinkaland.  Sudan is split in two now.  You are going home, and the Arabs will stay on their own land.” He is a good man.  That’s why he brought us here.  If we find our relatives, it will be because of him. I will now have to decide whether to go to church or to the mosque. I hope to see my siblings again.  I have good memories of them.  As long as I stay here, I will find them.   Narrative provided by Christian Solidarity International  "," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people.

Nyang Deng Jiel,2014 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I am from Nyala, in Darfur.  I never thought about South Sudan.  I don’t remember it.  I was very small when I was taken to the North, but old enough to know my Dinka name.  I don’t know my hometown in the South, but I know I had four sisters and three brothers, and that I was the youngest.  I have good memories of them – playing with them, being together. I lived with a man named Hamad Hassan in Nyala.  He was a cattle owner.  Hamad had six wives, twelve children, and six slaves.  He lived in the village, but I was sent into the bush to look after his cattle. He treated me badly.  If I lost a cow, I was beaten and called “son of a jengai [a racial epithet],” and then I had to go back out to find it and bring it back.  This happened several times, and when it did, I was not given good food to eat, only sorghum shells. His family treated me badly also.  If I looked lonely, and they asked me what I was doing and I answered, “Thinking about my parents,” they would say, “Why? We’re you’re family now.” Hamad made me call him father, and beat me if I didn’t.  He called me his son. I was never allowed to meet or talk with the other slaves.  They were kept in separate houses.  I was renamed “Saddam,” and I prayed like a Muslim and fasted during Ramadan.  It was hard to fast and work at the same time, but I accepted these things, and wanted to be a Muslim.  I wanted them to accept me. I was so excited when the slave retriever came.  The first day he came, Hamad refused to let him take me.  He came again the next day and spoke in private with Hamad, and then took me away.  I stayed in a different place with him for a few days, and then he brought me to a place with many more Dinka people, and told us, “We are going to South Sudan.” I will look for my parents now.   Narrative provided by Christian Solidarity International  "," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people.

When I was abducted, my father was killed in front of me.  They slit his throat with a knife.  Then the attackers took me, my mother and my siblings to the North.  I had three older sisters and two brothers.  Both my brothers died.  One of them was beaten to death on the way to the North.  I don’t know why the other one died, but he was very small – still nursing.  Once we arrived, we were separated from each other. I was taken to Mammud’s house.  He mistreated me.  Even though I was small, he beat me on my chest and back.  I still can’t lift heavy things because of it.  He raped me, even though I was a small girl.  I tried to resist, but he sliced my left breast with a knife, and then did it anyway. I had to collect water and firewood for Mammud’s household.  He had a wife named Asha and two children, Mamus and Yaya.  They were not my friends.  They wouldn’t let me eat with them, and gave me bad food to eat.  I slept in an outdoor hut with the goats. I was all alone.  I thought of my brothers and sisters often.  When I was sick and no one was there to care for me, I thought about them, because they would have taken care of me.  But I had no way to reach them. Mammud changed my name to Fatima, but it’s not my real name.  The Arabs told me they were planning to circumcise me.  One of Mammud’s children said, “It will make you our sister.” I felt bad, because this is not for the Dinka.  Dinka girls cannot be circumcised.  So every time they told me they were going to circumcise me the next day, I would run away in the morning and hide in the bush all day.  It became a problem for them.  They were angry, but they were worried I would get lost.  So they gave up.  They tried to make me pray like a Muslim.  I even fasted for three days during Ramadan, but I felt terrible and was suffering.  They didn’t want me to die, so they let me drink during the day and gave me some leftovers. Mammud tried to make me his wife, but I refused.  The father of my baby is a Dinka man named Rau.  He was a free worker who I met in the marketplace.  I decided to be his wife.  We kept it secret. After I became pregnant, I ran away.  I told my master I was going to the market for him, and when I got there, I disappeared.  I went to Matari, to Rau’s house, where the baby was born.  When I heard that there was an Arab man taking Dinka people back to South Sudan, I took my baby and went to meet the Arab man.  I wanted to see my family again.

Agany Ateny Angony,2014 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I am from Uyon in South Sudan.  I am 46 years old.  I was abducted in 1986.  At the time, I was married with two wives, and I worked as a cattle keeper. The Arab raiders found me and ordered me to take them to the Dinka cattle camp.  At first, I refused.  One of the raiders was a Dinka man who was living and fighting with the Arab army. He had been renamed Ajabana Abakar.  He tried to stab me with a knife, but the other raiders stopped him.  Then they beat me with sticks on the head until I agreed to show them where the cattle were.  That’s where I got my head scar.  After I brought them to the cattle, they took me to the North.  Ajabana put a hook in my mouth, and tied the hook to a horse to force me to go with them. In the North, I lived in Debeb in Kordofan, with a man named Mamoot Abdullah, one of the raiders who stopped Ajabana from killing me.  When I arrived in the North, I was told, “If you want to be free, you must become a Muslim.  If you do, we won’t bother you anymore.” So I did.  After that, the beatings stopped.  But I still had to work on the farm, and they still wouldn’t let me eat with them.  I asked them, “Why?  I’m a Muslim now,” but they refused.  If I had tried to leave, I would have been killed. There was a big famine at the time I was abducted, so after I was taken, my wives moved to the North to get food.  They stayed in the North, in an IDP camp in Meiram.  Fourteen years ago, I ran away from Mamoot and joined them.  The Arabs didn’t chase me, because by then, I was too old to be valuable to them. Life was not good in the IDP camp.  It was congested, and didn’t have anything we needed.  There was only an occasional sorghum distribution.  One of my wives and two of my children died of sickness in the camp.  My other wife, Ayak Akuei, is still alive.  We have two children. The slave retriever brought me here.  Without him, it would have been impossible to return to South Sudan – too dangerous. I am so happy to be here.  I didn’t think such a thing could happen.  I have everything here now – sorghum and the survival kit.  I will build a hut and a farm for my family.     Narrative provided by Christian Solidarity International  "," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people.

There was fighting, and many people were killed.  They took so many people.  I couldn’t count how many because they were beating us. They tied all the adults to a rope, and made us walk North.  They beat people who walked too slowly and sometimes left them for dead.  They also killed the cows that moved too slowly.  We didn’t go straight to the north; they traveled around the area capturing more people, cows and goats from the bush.  At night, they made the captured men put up a fence, and kept us inside it.  They shot anyone who left the fence. The slave raiders raped the women.  I was raped by two groups of men, first three, then two.  They beat me terribly with sticks to get me to submit.  I still have the scars on my chest.  I felt very sick afterwards.  But no one can ask them what they’re doing. They do whatever they please. When we reached the north, one of the raiders took me to be his slave.  His name was Amoth Akabar, and he lived in Tobung, in Kordofan.  He made me work to collect water, even though I was still suffering from my chest wound.  He had a big family, with many slaves.  He sold slaves to other people, and gave me to other Arab men for sex – any passerby who had a gun.  I complained to him about it, saying, “Why do you give me to these other men, when you are the one who took me here?” I had two children because of this.  As soon as they were old enough to start working, Amoth took them away from me.  I don’t know where they are.  I don’t even know their names.  Amoth gave them Arab names but didn’t tell me, and wouldn’t let me give them Dinka names. Amoth let me go after the slave retriever came and spoke with him.  The retriever told me he was taking me to South Sudan.  I was so happy, because life in the North was so bad, and I was beaten all the time for little mistakes, and often denied food.  But in the South, people are free.

Tehani,2011 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,Children,Yemen (slavery location),"During sex I was crying and begging him to stop but he didn’t listen. Then he put his hand on my mouth like this. I couldn’t breath and I was crying but he used me anyway. And I just cried. My age is 8.  They were decorating my hands with naqsh but I didn’t know they were going to marry me off. Then my mother came in and said ‘come on my daughter’. They were dressing me up and I as asking, ‘where are you taking me?’ they just said ‘come, come’, and then they performed the wedding.  […] I don’t know how children are made but they get pregnant and they deliver a baby. They carry it inside their stomach and then they deliver, and it comes out a baby.

Fumi,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,West Africa (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"It was arranged for me to come to the UK by mum. I don’t know exactly how much my mother paid, I’m not sure, but it was a lot of money. I arrived in Heathrow and they came to pick me up. They said, I owed more money on top of what my mother had paid. On the second or third day, they called me and said what sort of job I should be doing. When he said escorting, I didn’t want to assume what he was saying. I said, 'What do you mean, escorting people?' He said, 'What do you mean, do I have to explain myself? Are you a child? Okay, okay, I just have to be blunt with you. You will be a prostitute.' I said, 'Are you sure? Is there not something else, like teaching, or child-minding?' He said, 'No, no, no, you owe us a lot of money.' I asked about the money my mother had paid, and he said, 'No, it was for your ticket.' I had come with someone’s passport. You know, when you are desperate to leave, you just have to do anything. He said, 'You just have to work and pay it back. I said, 'No, I’m not going to do that. But he said, 'You have no choice, you have to do what you are told.' The first time I argued with the boss, who we had to call uncle, he was a very deadly looking human being. He knew I wasn’t going to accept what they wanted, unless they used force on me. So that first week, he beckoned me to come downstairs. I saw two huge guests, very big, they wore black and glasses, those guys, they held me down and they were whacking my mouth. I was scared for my life. I swore to pay their money. I swore never to run. After the incident, I went up to my room and was crying. Another woman who worked there came to knock on my door. I said, 'I don’t want to be sleeping with strangers, I don’t think I can.' I was saying, 'I want to go, I want to run.' I don’t know if she was lying, or trying to scare me, she said that someone had tried to run, and these guys shot her. That was the end of it, I thought I don’t want to lose my life. When the first customer came I said, 'I don’t want you near me.' It was someone I didn’t know and I don’t want to sleep with a total stranger. So I sent him away. Uncle came upstairs and said, 'If you play with me, I’ll play with you.' I knew what that meant, because my friend had told me about him killing someone. That guy was my nightmare. The same man came back the next day. He knew I didn’t want to. He said, 'Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.' I’m a prayerful person, I kept telling God that this is not me. The men would sometimes try to talk, I didn’t want to talk to people like that. I’m not interested. I saw them as evil. I grew up in a little city, with my mum, and dad, and older sister. And my parents were very supportive of my sister and I going to school. I went to university and studied maths education, as I wanted to be a teacher. I was very young when I got married, and he was my first love. We had lots of problems, it was always, fight, fight, fight. He was always beating me, so the last time I said, I’m not going back. I found myself in hospital for three days. It was bad, I had to run from my husband. I said, mum, I have to go abroad. I just want to leave the country. That is how I found myself here in England. I was thinking I was coming here for a better life, a new life. I didn’t know what would happen. But I will never forget the day I escaped. It was a weekday, I was clearing the house and taking the rubbish out because they had a small gate by the side. I used to look to see where I could run. The security guard would normally follow me outside. I used to be nice and friendly to them. So, on that fateful day, I took the bin out. The guards were inside. When I looked, they were not looking, they were talking and smoking, so I just dragged the bin outside and ran. I didn’t know where I was going, I just, ran. The month that I had escaped, the man I had met in the country came to my mother and began to threaten her. He said, your daughter has escaped, you have to pay the money. My mother said, if you want money, you have to provide my daughter and I will give you your money. He said, no, I don’t care, even if she’s dead, just pay us the money. So they kept fighting. And they kept harassing my mum, threatening her. She told my uncle what was happening, and so my family knew. If there was law and order in my country, my mum would have been able to go to the police. In the UK, there are laws. But in my country, it is money that speaks. The shame and the trauma of what I have been through, my mother was not happy. It led to her premature death. She died at 56. Now I fear returning home, my family has deserted me, my uncle called me a prostitute, they blame me. The people who trafficked me have connections everywhere, in the airport, with the police, and if I went home they would know. I am still in hiding, and they are still doing the same thing to other women. I’d like to return to my country and tell my story and be bold. I would tell other women and girls, the grass always looks greener, but don’t be deceived, no matter what promises they make to you. Never let them trick you. Even if you are scared, the lion is still there inside you. Wake the lion up. If I see uncle again, I will call the police instantly. I am not scared anymore.”   Narrative provided by Global Citizen"," There are an estimated 136,000 people living on conditions of modern slavery un the United Kingdom (Global Slavery Index 2018).

Jessa,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (slavery location) Canada (trafficked from) Children,Canada (slavery location),"As the silky touch of my wedding dress moved over my body, I saw a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Blinking several times, I almost didn’t recognize the women looking back at me, she was completely radiant. The dichotomy of my fairytale wedding and the things I had experienced in my past was great, but at that moment all I could do was fixate my eyes on my soon-to-be husband and walk toward him with abandoned joy.  Five years before I was in Vancouver as the noise and lights from the 2010 Winter Olympics festivities filtered into my room. Men raped me as my body tried to disappear from the deep burning pain, but there was nowhere to go. I wished desperately that this were a nightmare, but without knowing the real names of my pimps, I understood the gravity of my situation. I was a slave once again. The individuals who held me against my will were defining what was happening and although I was the one experiencing the pain, they owned my body. In response, I found myself completely numb toward my pimps: the people who had lied to me, coerced me, and forced me into selling my body for sexual favors so that they could profit from my shameful pain. I quickly turned this anger and hate onto myself.  I hated the fact that the abuse and trafficking I suffered growing up made me so vulnerable to more abuse and pain. I hated the fact that I trusted someone to help me when I was all alone in a new city. I hated the ways that I longed for safety and for someone to care. And most of all, at that moment, I hated the fact that I was still alive and that I had survived my childhood. As a young child, I was sexually abused by family members, which then progressed to me being given to child pornographers. Shortly after the child pornography started, they began to sell my body to countless men and other pimps in suburban neighborhoods. I was trafficked domestically in Canada, just as I was often taken to the USA and other international countries for the sole purpose of being trafficked.  I remember the smells, the sights, and the tastes of slavery. Silently the tears flow. The horror can’t be put into words, neither can the brothels I was taken to or the men and women I was forced to service. Not only did I see someone very close to me murdered, but police officers were some of my buyers and multiple times I was handcuffed, raped, and told that if I told anyone I would be put in jail. I was scared to reach out for help and growing up the message that was branded on my heart was the idea that I had no worth, I was shameful, and all I was good for was sex. When I was 21 years old, my life completely changed when I briefly met a lady who works with survivors of human trafficking. She gave me her phone number on a small piece of paper and told me that if I called her she would help me. The first time I called, I was under a mountainous pile of blankets hardly daring to breathe in case someone or worse yet, my pimp, would hear me. That first phone call was only a few minutes long, but during that hushed conversation, this lady began to speak truth into my life and speak truth to some of the negative messages I had received growing up. She told me that my value was not a dollar figure related to sex and she explained to me that my future did not have to be built upon the trauma that had happened to me. My escape wasn’t a fairytale like a Disney movie; instead it was encapsulated by fear and months of preparing. I was terrified of the unknown, frightened that I would be hunted down by my pimps and abusers and scared of what the future would hold. But in addition to being afraid, I also felt freedom for the first time. Freedom was being able to see the big blue sky and seeing the tumbleweed float around on the road as I was driven to a safe house and it felt like sunshine that kissed my face. Slowly like a flower beginning to open up her petals to the sunlight, I began to slowly soften to the people around me and I began to let love in. When the director at the safe house suggested that I enroll in college, I laughed in her face. I thought she was crazy. How could I go to college if I have never had an education growing up? How could I succeed if I had never written a paper in my life and didn’t know how to do simple math problems? In response I was simply told, “If you can read you can learn anything.” I wrote that phrase on my arm with a black Sharpie every day for over a year.  Last May, when I stood in front of my graduating class to deliver the valedictorian speech, the Sharpie story and many other stories flashed through my mind, including my first day of school when I sat on the parking lot and cried because I was convinced people would shun me if they knew about my past and the things I had been forced to do. Miracles not only happen, but after trauma it is possible to dream again and live life fully. I not only graduated with a BA in Clinical Counseling with a 4.0 GPA, married the man of my dreams, but also I am presently working on my MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling as a step toward my Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology where I would like to specialize in trauma recovery.  Although I have seen things that no one should ever see and I have experienced things that no one should ever experience, my beginnings do not define me. I refuse to let the evil of my past win. Instead, my pain has a purpose now.  It’s been a long journey, but through God’s redeeming love, safe people believing in me when I couldn’t believe in myself, and through people choosing to be in my life for the long haul and walking the messy road of healing by my side – I have changed. My past no longer has the power to hold me captive. I am an overcomer, I am a wife, I am a student, I am a professional, I am a speaker, I am an author, I am leader, I am an agent of change, and I am a confident woman who longs to make a difference in society.   Narrative provided by Global Citizen"," There are an estimated 17,000 people living in conditions of slavery in Canada (GSI 2018). Both Canadian and foreign citizens are exploited in forced labour and sex trafficking. Forced labour affects migrant workers under ‘low-skilled’ temporary visa streams including the low-wage and primary agricultural streams. These workers are often in restaurants, hotels, agriculture, food preparation, construction or domestic work. Sexual exploitation of Canadian citizens is the most common form of slavery detected by authorities in the country, with 93% of sex trafficking victims being Canadian.  As a child Jessa was sexually abused by family members and given to child pornographers. She tells of how this then led to the pornographer selling her body to men and other pimps. Jessa was trafficked across Canada, the US and other countries, forced to provide sexual services to men and women. At the age of 21 Jessa was approached by a woman working with survivors of trafficking. This began Jessa’s journey to freedom."
Sadhna,2017 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Sexual exploitation,India (slavery location),"My name is Sadhna. As a small child, I was fearless. I used to climb trees and pick fruits, run around and go fishing. I wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. […] Because of what happened to me, I was very afraid. I felt at that time nothing was going to change. My life was worthless. Now I have even more courage than before.   Narrative provided by International Justice Mission (IJM)"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India. The GSI 2018 reports an emerging trend in northeast India where organised trafficking syndicates operate along the open and unmanned international borders, duping or coercing young girls seeking employment outside their local area in to forced sexual exploitation. Many women and girls are lured with the promise of a good job but then forced in to sex work, with a 'conditioning' period involving violence, threats, debt bondage and rape.   Sadhna was 11 years old when her father passed away. Her family was left with no money in their village, so they moved to Kolkata in search of work. Sadhna was struggling as a house cleaner when a local woman offered her a new job. Sadhna followed the woman to a house filled with strange men and beer. She was given a glass of water and immediately fell unconscious. She woke to find she had been raped and was now to be sold for sex from a private brothel, she was 14 years old. Sadhna was rescued by IJM and now shares her story with other girls in India."
Brooke,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),"Like many survivors of domestic violence, my abuse started long before I met my then-boyfriend. Sexual exploitation trained me to believe I was unworthy of the love I so desperately craved. I was 7 years old when I was trafficked for sex. My favorite color was pink and I loved to dance. My room was filled with books, dolls and art. I read for hours on my white chair surrounded by stuffed animals, listening to my white music box with the delicate roses and gold edges. When I took baths, I would rest on my back and sing my first song, “Flying wings, angel sing, strawberry dreams.” Over and over I would sing the same chorus, moving my arms like an angel. Hanging from the bathroom wall was a framed scripture from the book of I Samuel. It is known as Hannah’s Prayer, but in this version, my name replaced the son she prays for. The calligraphy read, “I have prayed for this child, Brooke, and the Lord has granted me what I have asked of him, so now I give her to the Lord for her whole life she will be given over to him.” My mom taught me God is love. But she was in the hospital and I feared she would never return. My dad traveled for work to take care of our family, so I also had a nanny. My nanny talked about God, too. He said it was God’s will for him to punish me for my sins. What punishment did I deserve? He did not say the word and I did not have language for what was happening. I could not tell anyone what his deity demanded on my white iron bed with the pink sheets. He called me a “worthless whore” and said I made him do this to me. When he raped me, repeating the Lord’s prayer, I flew outside my body. Sometimes his voice still echoes within me, “Deliver us from evil. Deliver us from evil.” A part of me split off to survive, to guard the truth, to carry the unbearable weight of this. I multiplied and disappeared. The first rape was my initiation, my rite of passage into his underworld. A place filled with secrets and shadows, people with dead eyes. From that initial violation, he secretly took me to houses, hotels, and parties to sell me to men for sex. I was forced into pornography with adults and other children. I was caged and taunted like a trapped animal. When they filmed me I flew outside my body to take refuge in the beautiful worlds I created: one with a white horse, one where I danced with the angels. Each time they invaded me, I soared above them. I was passed from man to man, hand to hand, like a doll. My soul traveled and retreated, crossed oceans, centuries. I lived a thousand lives in a single night. This rhythm continued. During the day, I attended school. At night, I belonged to him — and whoever was interested in buying me. The buyers were always wealthy white men who were insatiable in their appetite to inflict pain. I numbed myself, circling my life as if it belonged to someone else. I became a spectator of the abuse. This is happening to some other little girl, the evil one, who needed to be punished, I told myself. I created a wall, so I could live on the light side, be the good one and continue without pain. Finally, my mom came home from the hospital in a wheelchair. I was too terrified and ashamed to reveal the abuse, but she sensed something was wrong. She listened to her intuition and fired my nanny. The exploitation ended suddenly, but my shame did not. No matter how much I accomplished in life, I was still haunted by his lie about me, “Worthless, worthless, worthless.” I lived for many years concealing the secret of my trauma. What I witnessed felt unspeakable. Faced with an abusive boyfriend as an adult, I sought out help from a brilliant counselor specializing in sexual violence and resolving developmental trauma. It was there, with her, that I finally felt safe enough to admit what had happened to me — beyond the domestic abuse— and find my healing path. Eventually, through therapy, an inspiring community of other survivors, and my own creative expression through poetry and music, I found my way back to my original worth. But my recovery has also given me a greater understanding of sex trafficking and how it’s perpetuated. We live in a culture where women and girls are reduced to sexual commodities, where sexual and domestic violence are not aberrations. For many of us, they are rites of passage, the training ground for internalizing our own oppression. Child sex trafficking is part of this continuum of violence. It is rape for profit. The appearance of consent is merely a performance the child must enact to survive. Even if a child is actively trading sex for money, food or shelter to survive, this still qualifies as statutory rape. There is no such thing as a child sex worker or child prostitute. There is only child rape. It is easy to blame those who profit from the exploitation of children — as well we should. But they are not the whole problem. In a country where one out of six American women are survivors of sexual assault and one out of four women are survivors of domestic violence, traffickers are simply monetizing a culture that normalizes violence against women and girls at epidemic rates. This brutal reality along with the pervasive cult of victim-blaming has created the perfect marketplace for the buying and selling of children. In my work as an advocate, I’ve learned that facing the truth is the beginning of freedom. To be free, we have to bring everything into the light, so our shame and our secrets no longer have power over us. As survivors, we may never see our perpetrators held accountable for their crimes, but we are creating our own justice. Our justice is to overcome, to know our worth, to rise up as leaders, transforming pain into the power of compassion.   Narrative provided by Global Citizen"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking exists throughout the country. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Brooke was trafficked for sex by her nanny at 7 years old while her mother was in hospital and her father travelled for work."
Radhika,2017 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,Nepal (trafficked from) Children,Nepal (slavery location),"When my mother-in-law talked about having children I felt I was too young to have a baby.

I had been in Kathmandu and then came back to Palung. We met when I came back. We started seeing each other. Then they came to my house to talk with my parents and I got married. There wasn’t much pressure. After my in-laws came to ask for my hand in marriage, my family felt this was a positive proposal from a nice boy and married me off. The earthquake struck on 25 April, 2015. Our school was shut. I said I would go back to school after I reopened, but my family asked me not to go as my marriage had been arranged. I felt really sad when I had to leave school. After only a few months of being married, my mother-in-law kept asking whether I was pregnant. I used to get stomach pains during my period. My mother-in-law told me that women with painful periods have problems having children. My husband had asked me if we should use condoms. I said no as people were saying we shouldn’t. and so I became pregnant. I had dreamed of continuing my studies and becoming a nurse. If I hadn’t got married maybe I would have become a nurse.

My mom and I ended up going to Florida because the scuba diver had a scuba diving business, because that’s my mom, or was my mom’s dream, was to own a dive business and so her was going to show her kind of like how to run one and, yeah because he had a very successful one. I was 16, we went out to dinner with a few of his friends that was when I found out that he had an open marriage with his wife. It wasn’t open for her, but it was open for him, so he had a girlfriend and so we met her there, and that threw me for a loop. Yeah so it was thanksgiving like that same year, my mom asked for a divorce and then she moved to Florida like, December 1st. Now I later know that it was a huge part of that, of like telling my mom that my dad was doing these awful things behind her back. Um after, honestly after I found out that he had an open marriage with his wife I didn’t trust him and I didn’t necessarily like him because of that. And so I, we didn’t keep in contact. So, when I saw him we hadn’t talked in like I don’t know two to three months and so I definitely wasn’t very happy to see him. So, I was working two jobs, I was waitressing and so I mean we were just barely making it and there was multiple times where he would say that like we have to find another option. And I as like okay, so like, I like had a lot of good ideas of like, and we later now figured out that they would have worked. He was like no, that won’t work, you have this cost and this cost and so I mean every idea that we could have ever thought of he was going to shoot down. Then the whole apartment thing came in of like, if you don’t become a part of the family then you to go. That’s was it was called the ‘family’. He took me down to the keys for like a like welcome to Florida, and a lot of inappropriate things he tried to do. And I said no because `he tried to get me to be part of the family there. He in order to become part of the family I had to have sex with him, and I wouldn’t do that. Yeah so I mean we definitely weren’t making ends meet, and so the conversation of him saying like you either become part of the family or you get kicked out of the apartment. So that’s when I did have to have sex with him because I was about to get kicked out of the apartment. There’s a two-week period in April that I can’t remember. I’ve narrowed it down to like, between using social media and the pictures on my phone and like what I remember. It’s like to narrow it down to like the brainwashing period. Because in most cases the brainwashing period, you can’t remember beause you repress it. And so that’s like the two period that I can’t remember. The only thing I remember after I’d agreed to do whatever needs to be done, I’d have sex with him 2-3 times a day for two weeks. I remember that, I don’t remember the sex or anything though. The intial plan I guess you could say was that that was like the prepping, like him having sex with me and like preparing me for going on a trip. Because the trip that we ended up going on was me and his girlfriend. That’s where the prostitution happened. So, he took me up to Georgia and then all the way across to Texas. He would post me up on Backpage. Like he wouldn’t show my face, but it was like pictures of me and then erm he would like posed it in an area. So, like in Georgia we were at military bases we had like a kind of, it’s called a ditch phone and it’s like a prepaid phone that you can’t really track and so the guys would call that number and they’d make an appointment. So, in Georgia I think it was, there was like seven clients and I don’t remember all of the details, but in Texas is where I got hurt and I couldn’t work on the way back. So that was definitely a godsend. Him and his girlfriend were in like a very, they were always fighting and so they, they were like fighting inside one time and I was sitting in the car and like, I was freaking out. So there was a guy sitting next to us in like a convertible car and I was considering like jumping in his car and like telling him to take me to a bus stop because I like wanted out of there. [What stopped you escaping?] That he would find me later on, and it would be worse. He had told us that he was like a sniper in the military. He was an ex-military person and so I was definitely scared to death that he had those kinds of tactics to be able to find me. He always had a pistol with him. [What were your feelings at the time?] Frustration, fear, erm rag doll. I’ll never forget like how I felt just being an object of someone because  it was like, here these guys are, don’t know me like don’t even realise that I’m a daughter to someone that like I’m a sister to someone. Like they very well may have those siblings and they’re just using me because it’s just what they want in the moment. And so, definitely just like an object to people. I wasn’t allowed to contact anybody from my past. I had no idea, like I knew it was a bad situation but I didn’t know it was illegal, I didn’t even know that human trafficking existed and so like I didn’t know, even up until the point of him getting arrested. I had no idea what he was charge with because I didn’t know what human trafficking was. Up until they had to explain to me what he was charged with because I had no idea. I went to her [my mother] and told her everything that had happened. She didn’t know what was happening on the trip and she found out, and so she was furious about that, and so we drove back to the apartment and we kicked him out of the apartment, and then we went to the police, The only thing like going in to that police department, one was by God’s own strength and courage because, we didn’t have any by that point. And so like that was a god send that we were even bale to do that, and then just going there, we were focused on just like safety wise. Like he could come back, like he had a key to the apartment and so we’re like we have to do something. Once they figured out that like there had been like sexual intercourse between me and him, then nnce I shared about like what had happened on the trip and stuff, then they were like this is a lot bigger than we were imaging. So then it became federal when it was across state lines. My mom and I were put into protective custody because he still wasn’t arrested at that point and so then we were in a hotel room for like 2 weeks while they were arresting him. Then he got arrested in Hawaii. Oh yeah he had all the evidence. The ditch phone and all the backpage ads were never deleted and actually kept the ditch phone, because he told her to throw it out and for some reason which was completely God, she didn’t and so that was the evidence they had against him. To arrest him, later on they found more though. It’s just something from my past like I can’t let it affect me today like I can’t live with that fear I mean I definitely still have those flashbacks and the fears that some person from his past is gonna come like hurt me or something, but I mean I can’t, I can’t live my life like that. It’s a God send that I’m even sitting here today, let alone that I’m healed to the point that I am and have the confidence and the strength that I had. And so, I mean a lot of counselling, I mean my friends, my family erm everyone that’s been so supportive. But the centre of it is God, and that’s what I cling to. Like I was in one of the most upper-class places in the United States and there’s nothing, I mean there’s obviously situations that od happen tha tis it in like high poverty area, but it’s everywhere. From lower class, to middle class to upper class and everywhere in between. It’s here, in your neighborhoods. It’s really hard, it is. But the best thing you could do for yourself is just keep going to counselling doing everything possible to just like find the hope and like what it can bring to other people, like I’m doing this video right now like it, like can change someone’s life. It can change a trafficker’s life, it can change a parent’s life. You can change so many people’s lives by just like using your story. Just like be that like safety person for other people. Like for me, I love talking to teen girls because everyone desires a boyfriend, everybody wants to get married one day. And if some amazing guy comes in to your life saying I can fulfil all that, like you’re gonna jump towards that so being like confident in yourself and who you are, and not needing that stuff will keep you on the right track. It’s like finding that one thing that you’re passionate about. The main thing that I had to work through was understanding that I didn’t make this decision to do this. And so saying like saying like oh well I chose to do this, like no you didn’t choose to do this because you were coerced. Human trafficking is force, fraud or coercion. Just like putting it into perspective of like that kid is like a daughter, a sister, family to someone. Like it’s not an object. This person has feelings. Like this person doesn’t enjoy what you’re making them go through. But is so scared of you just because of like all the force, fraud and coercion that you’ve done. But that they’re a real person. There’s a stereotype, if they could see me they would see that I’m definitely not a stereotype. It’s not just drug addicts, it’s not just like high poverty, it’s I mean your everyday people but any person with any vulnerability is at risk. If that’s you have divorced parents, or you didn’t have a dad growing up or you don’t have a lot of friends or you were bullied in high school. It’s just, everybody has a vulnerability and so whether you have low self-confidence like all that stuff can be used against you and human trafficking isn’t an issue to take lightly. In this moment as we’re talking, as people are listening, children are being sold all around the world. In Florida, in Colorado, in Texas, everywhere children are being sold.   Narrative produced and provided by Christy’s Cause Original narrative can be found here  "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking exists throughout the country. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Taylor was trafficked out of Florida by a family friend when she was 16 years old. Taylor was subjected to sexual abuse and trafficked around the country, forced to provide sexual services. She was finally able to escape and went to her mother who called the police. Taylor was in FBI witness protection while her trafficker was being prosecuted. She is now 18 years old and her trafficker has been sentenced to 30 years in federal prison followed by lifetime supervised release."
Liubo,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour Debt bondage,Poland (trafficked from) Debt bondage,United Kingdom (slavery location),"I am Liubo from Poland, my wife - Biatka, and our daughter - Cristi. We were struggling financially and were offered work on a Scottish farm. When we arrived we were given a room in a barn with insects and rats, one mattress on the ground for all of us, no loo. The rent was £700, but the money from working on the farm was insufficient. Our debt went on growing. To pay for it the traffickers obtained a bank loan for us, which they then controlled. Their plan was to claim and keep the state benefits which were due to our daughter. The farm owner was linked to a Polish network that regularly transported people to Britain. One day we managed to escape. The traffickers caught up with us. They tried to force us into their car and punched me in the face. The police were called. We were saved. We are now penniless, we don’t speak English and we are worse off than ever before. ","The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. Liubo and his wife Biatka found themselves sin debt bondage after accepting work on a farm in Scotland. Their story demonstrates the challenges that survivors of slavery face, even once they have escaped, as they are often left unsupported and without legal status in the destination country."
Loreta,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Italy (slavery location) Lithuania (trafficked from),Lithuania (slavery location),"I was born near the Lithuania–Latvia border. Since my alcoholic parents were incapable of caring for me, social workers sent me to a state-run children’s home. My seven brothers and six sisters were also sent to group homes, scattered across the country. Growing up in a children’s home was really tough. We often tried to run away. The wardens treated us badly and beat us heavily for any perceived misdeed. Unhappy and depressed, I started smoking opium when I was 13 years old. We couldn’t wait until we turned 15 and could legally leave the home. At that time, the Soviet Union assigned newly emancipated children a foster parent until they turned 18 years old. The only person who ever visited me was a man who claimed to be my godfather. He already had two foster children and told me I could live with him when I turned 15. All my friends thought I was very lucky and special. One day, however, when I was 13, he raped me. I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t think anyone would believe me. Everyone at the home said, “You are lucky you have someone who will take care of you when you leave.” They didn’t understand why I kept saying that I never, ever wanted to live with the man. When my 15th birthday finally arrived, I was very relieved because I thought nobody would ever again have the right to hurt me, boss me around, or punish me. I left the home without any idea that this was only the beginning of a very difficult road. I was sent against my will to live with my godfather and began to consume more opium. Shortly after my 16th birthday, a 21-year-old woman named Dana introduced herself to me as my sister. She treated me more like an acquaintance than a sibling, but I figured it was because we’d spent so much time apart. I hoped we would grow closer. Whenever I visited her apartment, there were many young women there who drank a lot and talked about going “to the bar to hook up with some studs.” I thought their language was interesting but didn’t understand what they meant. A couple of months later, my sister asked me if I had any girlfriends my age and I said I did. She didn’t mention my girlfriends again for a long time. One day, Dana asked if she could drop by my place to see how I lived. She came with her friend and inspected how my four friends and I lived. We had no idea that they had visited us to secretly decide if we were fit for prostitution. We had never heard of “human trafficking” because everyone in the Soviet Union was fed propaganda that claimed that “life is beautiful.” The next night Dana invited me and my two friends over to her apartment—even specifying the name of the friends I should bring—and promised to pay for our taxi. When we got there, we saw three more girls our age and seven Greek men speaking in English, drinking alcohol, talking and laughing. My sister and her friend told to us to chat with them, but I told them that we didn’t feel comfortable meeting the men whom we didn’t understand. Dana grew angry and demanded we talk to them. She said we owed her friend money for the taxi ride that she had promised to pay for. She asked me if I really didn't understand where I was and what we were expected to do. I had no idea. That’s when Dana explained she’d invited us over to sell our bodies. She told us that we would be prostitutes from now on. My friends and I were shocked and refused, but my sister’s friend threatened to call “the gang” if we continued to refuse to pay for the taxi and sell ourselves. She told us that the gang would beat us, rape us, and bury us alive in the woods. My friends and I started crying. I told Dana that I didn’t understand how she could do this to her sister. From that day on, Dana was no longer my sister but my madam. That night after I sold my body, I felt repulsed. I wouldn’t get out of the shower until I washed everything away. I felt so humiliated. I heard my friends crying too. I was in prostitution from age 15 to 19. My friends and I lived in one apartment with the madam. When we had clients, taxi drivers would call and she would tell us to get ready. The clients waited in bars, nightclubs or hotels. Sometimes, we brought them to our apartment. We worked from 4pm till late night or early morning with three to four clients a day. Sometimes we used condoms, but sometimes we didn’t. Most of the clients were foreigners who didn’t speak my language and didn’t care about my age. I didn’t know how to contact the police and I didn’t know if the police would even care. I wanted to run away, but was scared the gang would find me and kill me. My self-loathing grew, so I began injecting myself with drugs. I tried to numb myself from the pain so I wouldn’t feel anything at all. When I turned 17, the madam told us that a pimp was selling us abroad. One girl was sold in Poland, two in Budapest, and the rest of us were taken to Ravenna, Italy. When we arrived, we were sold to men whose language we didn’t understand. They took us to a brothel filled with women aged 14-32, trafficked from Belorussia, Poland, and Lithuania. We had to take care of our clients in the public restrooms within 15 minutes. Pimps prevented us from escaping and used violence to force us to work in the streets. After two weeks in Italy, I had an older client who understood Lithuanian. I took a risk and begged for his help. His friend took my friends and me to the Italian police. I was so surprised by how well the police treated us. They helped us get documentation so we could return to Lithuania and helped us change our names and appearances so the pimps couldn’t find us. We were sent to an Italian organization that worked with victims of human trafficking and were granted refugee status. We spent around four months in protective custody until our identification documents were sorted out and then were brought to Vilnius, Lithuania where social workers took care of us. We lived there for about a year. A social worker worked with me a lot and helped me realize how I had been exploited. As I struggled to rebuild my life, I realized that I didn’t have any chance of supporting myself with only a ninth grade education, so I started making and selling drugs. Then, I met the man who would father my first child. After I got pregnant, I stopped the drugs. I tried to take care of my child and was moved from place to place. Over the years, I had three other children with different men. I really love my children and I live only for them, but I do not love their fathers. I realize that I cannot keep a long-term relationship with any man, probably because I hate how men have treated me. When people ask me what I think about prostitution, I tell them that I sympathize with women who are trying to provide for their children and have no other option. I knew a woman whose pimp controlled her access to her children. She was scared to death and had no choice but to stay with her pimp. Many girls stay in prostitution just so they can buy drugs, but the majority of them only became drug addicts to escape their terrible lives. I think the pimps should be gunned down, so that none of them are left on this earth. Maybe that would put an end to human trafficking and prostitution. As for myself, I hope to help children who are vulnerable, children who might fall prey to pimps. I live for these children and for my own four children.","Observers estimate 40 percent of identified Lithuanian trafficking victims are women and girls subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Lithuanian women are also subjected to sex trafficking in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Having grown up in a state-run children’s home, Loreta was prostituted from age 15 to age 19 by a man who claimed to be her Godfather. After escaping her abusers, she lived at the Klaipeda Social and Psychological Services Center in Lithuania for a year, where she was provided with holistic survivor-oriented services to help her regain control of her life."
Mabel,2014 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Ghana (trafficked from),Ghana (slavery location),"My grandfather said he can’t send us to school because he spent his money to bury our mother, so we have to work to pay the money. I feel scared because the lake is very big. When the wind is blowing, you can just go down, and you will die. They would tell me I must hold the net. They are going to throw the net, so if they throw the net and then they are coming [back], I should be folding it. If they came and I am not folding it, they will cane me. They will use the paddle to cane me.  If we come back from the lake, they would say I should cook. If I told them, today I am tired, I can’t cook, then they would start beating me and insulting me. I hardly slept at all. Every evening I hoped that there would be a storm, so I wouldn’t have to go out on the lake. I like math and social studies. I had never been to school before, so some words are difficult for me. When I came [to the school set up by charity Challenging Heights], they started teaching me how to write my name, how to pronounce words, and how to read. My favorite thing is the teachers. They like the children, and I like how they teach. I want to become a nurse, so I can prove to my family that I can make it in life. ","On Lake Volta in Ghana, child slaves are forced to work day and night on dangerous and deadly fishing boats. Mabel was one of them, trafficked into slavery by her own impoverished family. Mabel was forced into labor off the boat, too. She was forced to work around the clock. Early in the morning, she was forced to collect wood and cook maize porridge. She was forced to make lunch and dinner for workers on the boats. She was beaten and abused. Late at night Mabel was forced to go out fishing on the dangerous lake. Today she is free and getting an education. "
Mahinda,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour Debt bondage,India (trafficked from) Debt bondage,India (slavery location),"A contractor gave us an advance and brought us to Punjab. Eight other families from our village came with us. We were promised that we would get very good wages, which would allow us to save money for our daughters’ marriages, so we agreed. However, when we began working we were told our wages wouldn’t be paid until the end of the season. We were only paid a petty amount (about 500 INR, £5) each week or two to sustain our whole family. It wasn’t enough. We said we’d leave if we weren’t paid properly. Our contractor then said we could only leave if we paid back the advance, which had already increased from the original amount because we now discovered we had to pay for housing, water, electricity and transport in addition to repaying the advance, and the interest too. The debt just kept increasing. We wanted to see the wage records to see how much we were earning each day, and how much of the debt we were paying off, but we weren’t allowed.","Entire families migrate every year from other states in India to find work in Punjab’s brick kilns. The survey data suggest that there are more than 18 million people or 1.4 percent of the total population, who are living in conditions of modern slavery in India. Industries implicated in survey data include domestic work, the construction and sex industries, agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, manual labour, and forced begging. Most of India’s slavery problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata—lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups—are most vulnerable. Mahinda’s story shows a feature common to those who find themselves in debt bondage: workers are not permitted to see records relating to their own debt, meaning that they have no indication of when they might be released."

Once I was hit so hard in the head I had to have stitches. Then one day my Aunt tried to drown me in the bath, but I screamed so loud the neighbours heard my cries and called the Police.

In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, including intergenerational bonded labour, forced child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced recruitment into nonstate armed groups and forced marriage.

Margeaux,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),United States (slavery location),"This is the first time speaking in front of a group like this and being here marks an important part of my survival. Let me explain.  I was trafficked as a very young child. I was taken to private residences and hotels, then auctioned off to anyone willing to pay. Despite numerous, unexplained, very grown up health problems, no physician ever asked whether I was being abused, much less trafficked, not once. When I finally escaped at 18, the first nightmare ended. I learned quickly that my own isolated horror would be difficult to move beyond. Consequently, I have struggled with post-traumatic disorder, an eating disorder, peripheral neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, and blindness. All related to the trauma of sexual and physical abuse. I have battled to put the suffering behind me and being able to sit up here, confident enough to tell my story, an advocate for change, this is truly a milestone in my recovery. I have come to know that a trafficking survivor is never 100 percent free until we rid ourselves completely of the trauma’s effects. That doesn’t happen overnight. It’s an evolution. It doesn’t happen without a personal commitment and help. We are following victims but not adequately providing them with essential services that will help them become a true survivor. For me, if it were not for art therapy and other psychological services that I received, I very well would not have survived even after I escaped my trafficker. I would not have the courage to speak out against the injustice of human trafficking. Earlier this month, Congress passed an appropriations package to fund federal anti-trafficking organizations or programs for the physical [fiscal] year of 2014 and there were actually increases in funding for victim services. The first 10 in 10 years, that funding has risen. This is a big win and an important one.  Because every year, an increasing number of cases are identified through calls to the National Human Trafficking hotline. But this is just the first step. We need this funding and more simply to provide the critical emergency services, shelter, food, and emergency medical care for the growing number of trafficking victims.  We need to go beyond emergency care and services. We need a national commitment and financial investment to train doctors, psychologists, workers, social workers, and providers so that they can better understand the unique struggles and provide the services trafficking victims need to truly survive. I believe strongly that access to psychological services should be a legal right. For every survivor of human trafficking, there should be no limitations on that, and when the service is made available. The process of recovery can be slow and unpredictable like recovery from any post traumatic stress disorder.  The United States has been seen as a leader in the fight against human trafficking. I’m proud of many things our country has done. My hope is that policy makers will make a much stronger commitment to end modern slavery and provide every trafficking victim with the services that they need to restore their mind, body, and spirit so that they can all become true survivors like me.","Particularly vulnerable populations in the United States include: children in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems; runaway and homeless youth; unaccompanied children. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Marheaux was exploited sexually as a child in the United States, but is now an activist and advocate for other survivors of slavery. She argues for better support for those leaving situations of enslavement."
Mark,2012 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Netherlands (slavery location) Sweden (slavery location),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was unemployed. I had no income whatsoever. I guy pulled up to me in a car, quite an expensive car. He said that as well as working, he’d give me somewhere to stay. He’d provide food for me. He’d try to make me as comfortable as possible and he’d pay me 50 pounds a day. Then my boss decided to go up to the site that his family lives on and there everything went very quickly downhill. He stopped paying me anything at all. We were working up to 15 hours a day. And it’s very, very physical work, very, very heavy work. There were a lot of broken looking people. There was no rest. Every waking minute of every day was spent working somehow. There were, I’d say around 20 other workers on the site who were working for other members of my boss’ family. They were physically punished for the slightest little thing. They would beat them for not working fast enough. I’ve seen people attacked with work tools, with spades, with pick axes. They have their heads shaved. They live 15 men in a horse box. It was very much like a concentration camp. A lot of them were extremely hopeless. There were guys that had been there for five years or more who’d given up all hope. They couldn’t see any way to leave. They’d seen people try to run away in the past and always, every single time, a day later or two days later, they’d be dragged back. By the time I was 24 years old, I have a decent education. I'm physically fit. How could this happen to me, sort of thing. It’s really, really difficult for people to understand that it could happen to anybody.

Mike,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,United Kingdom (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"The financial crisis cost me my job. I slept rough. Two men approached me. They offered me work near London. I shared an old dirty shed with a tin roof with another man. Every day we were picked up by a van at 7am and then knocked on people’s doors asking if they wanted any work doing, digging patios or making drive-ways. We were picked- up at 9pm: if we didn’t get back in time, we’d get beaten. Everyone was afraid. Some got beaten up often, punched in the head or kicked. We worked 6 days a week unpaid. Someone tried to escape, but was beaten with a spanner. One Sunday the police raided. I had never heard of trafficking before. When I looked around, I saw how ill everyone looked, skinny and unwell, as if we had all been in a concentration camp. For the first time in my life I am now being cared for, thanks to the Salvation Army. I am still nervous of going out alone.","The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014.

Minjiza,2017 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery Forced marriage,Tanzania (trafficked from) Forced marriage,Tanzania (slavery location),"Whilst my brothers were allowed to go to school, I was forced to stop when I turned twelve, and my parents started making plans for me to be married, even though I didn’t want to. I ran away from home. In a church I went to for help, the pastor referred me to one of his church members, who was looking for a domestic worker. My employer told me I would be paid 10,000 shillings per month (about £3) but every time she was not satisfied with my work she deducted money. Often I only got about half of what I’d been told. I had to work seventeen hours a day and they gave me no time off. My employer never showed me kindness, she kept insulting me. After three years, as her children grew older, she just threw me out. I went to the church again for help and this time they put me in touch with Agape (Anti-Slavery International’s partners in Tanzania). Now I am happy. I’ve only been here at Agape for two months but I have friends. In the future I want to be a nurse, so I can help educate and care for children, especially girls who are at risk if they get pregnant too young.","In Tanzania, internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims’ family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in domestic servitude throughout the country and in sex trafficking particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with Kenya. Minjiza’s account makes clear the supportive role NGOs like Agape can play in helping survivors of slavery to build a life for themselves."
Mirela,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Forced marriage,Albania (trafficked from) Forced marriage,United Kingdom (slavery location),"I had a normal upbringing in Albania - my mother a nurse, my father an army officer. When my parents died, I was 17, my brother younger. I was studying accountancy. My uncles were appointed guardians. I had to sign over our home to them. At 20, I was forced into an arranged marriage. It was a disaster. So I used to meet friends on the beach. One man, Edon, took an interest in me. He suggested we eloped to Italy. We did but I grew uneasy. Plans kept changing. I was given a false Italian ID card. I travelled alone through France to the UK. When I arrived, a couple met and took me to their house. Edon and other men were there. They ridiculed and humiliated me. I was then gang raped while all present looked on and laughed. Edon told me that I was now his slave. I was held captive for nearly a year. I had to service up to ten men a day. During the summer, one man spent the night with me. He got drunk. I escaped through an open window. I ran and ran. I was found and placed in a safe house. I have no idea if my captors were caught or what happened to Edon. I’m unsure as to my future.

Moulkheir,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour Sexual exploitation,Mauritania (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Mauritania (slavery location),"I grew up working as a slave for a family. My mother worked for them before me and my children also worked for the family once they were old enough. It was hard work and we had to go out and look after the goats in the day and then come back and do all the housework in the evening. I didn’t always get enough to eat and was beaten regularly. My children all grew up working for the family too. Two of my girls are the daughters of the master’s eldest son. He said he would behead me if I ever told anyone they were his. When I had my fourth child, a baby girl, the family wouldn’t let me take her out to the fields with me. I came home one day and found that the baby had been left out in the sun all day. She had died and her body was being eaten by ants. I had to bury her myself, with my hands; it felt like I was burying an animal instead of my child. One day they sent me to another home. My new master was a colonel. The policemen saluted him when they came round. Later, the Colonel said he wanted to marry me, but I was already pregnant at the time. When he learned this, he decided he would marry my eldest daughter instead. She was very young. She cried and cried. Well, he called it marriage, but there was no dowry, no ceremony, nothing. It was just a way to abuse her. He used to make me watch him rape her at gunpoint. He raped me too, in front of my two daughters, threatening us all with his gun. He did this on several occasions. Then my daughter became pregnant, but he didn’t want his wife to find out that he had ‘married’ this young girl. He made us get in his car and he started driving out up and over the dunes, fast. I knew he was trying to make her miscarry. A few days later, she became very ill. She gave birth, but the child was stillborn – it was blue. He took my daughter back but he threw me out. I went and found my older brother and told him what had happened. He went to Boubacar (the President of Anti-Slavery partner in Mauritania SOS-Esclaves) and told him my story. Whilst I was arranging with SOS-Esclaves to rescue my daughter, she managed to escape for herself, with help from some Haratine (ethnic group of slave descent) neighbours. Now I have my daughter back I am pressing charges against the Colonel, for the slavery and the rape of my daughter. My life has changed. I arrived here like a crazy person; I didn’t even know how to behave around people. But it’s been with the help and support of the members of SOS-Esclaves that I have found a new life. I have even been trained in dyeing and sewing veils.","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives. People in slavery come from the Haratine ethnic group, historically enslaved by White Moors. They can be bought and sold, or given as gifts, and face a lifetime of exploitation and abuse. Rape of female slaves is common and their children also become slaves. They are Muslims, and many believe that it is Allah’s wish for them to be enslaved because they are told that their paradise is bound to their Master. In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem. Moulkeir was born a slave but is now free, and pressing charges against her former “owner,” and is being trained in textile skills."
Natalie,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,South East Asia (slavery location) South East Asia (trafficked from),Australia (slavery location),"When I was 20 years old, and my daughter was a little over one, I moved to the city. That’s when my life changed forever. I looked for a job in my native country in Southeast Asia, but couldn’t find anything. I ended up sleeping in a bus stop, waiting for people to help me, because I didn’t know anyone. I met an old man who got me a job working for a Japanese company through one of his relatives. They helped me arrange accommodation at a hostel, and for a few months things went well. One of the girls from the hostel introduced me to a man who was her friend. We used to all go out together. One night he took me out for dinner with one of his friends. We talked normally all through dinner — ‘how is life’, that sort of thing. Then the man I came with got a phone call and had to leave. He never came back. It got late. The other man said to me that he had a hotel, and I could stay there and wait. As we walked to the hotel, he was nice, but once we got there, everything changed. It was not a hotel, it was an illegal brothel. He introduced me to the girls, telling them to instruct me on what to do. I had been sold. I felt like my life was over. I didn’t know what was going on. I was hoping I would wake up and it would all be a dream. I had to sleep there and do whatever they said, but at least I could use condoms. I had to stay, and I had to work because he had bought me. I didn’t get paid anything. After a few months, I managed to run away. I finally decided to move overseas—to Australia, so that I could one day return home with more options. I could study there and use the qualifications I earned back in my home country. I had so many dreams; I was happy. I went on my first ever plane trip! However, Australia was worse than my home country. I was told when I got to Sydney that I had a debt of $6000AUD plus commission per job, plus rent, plus transport, plus cleaning, and everything else they charged for. If you were five minutes late they charged you $50. It all adds up. And this was in a ‘legal’ brothel. I could not say no to clients—no way! I couldn’t even stop and sit for a minute. I had to do it as many times in one hour as the client could do it. Three months felt like 30 years. We could sleep for maybe three hours a night, starting work at noon, finishing at 6am. Eventually, I managed to run away from there too. I was in the sex industry for seven years, on and off. I wanted to leave for a long time. For three years I tried to get another job to support me and my daughter. Finally, Project Respect came into my life. A friend told me about them and introduced me to one of their staff members. If they had not helped to get me a job, I would probably still be there. I am in my 30s now and I have fully left, but it’s not easy. I don’t understand why trafficking happens. If women could earn proper money, it wouldn’t happen. Women go into the sex industry for the money, not because they like it. Men should not be allowed to buy sex. Why do they want to buy sex? Men who buy sex are not good at all; maybe they are good in the outside world, but in ‘our world’ they are nasty. They think that because they pay, you are like a slave. Trafficking is the worst part. We can’t talk; we have to do what we are told. When I had my period I said that I couldn’t work, but you have to. When a customer is rough, you still have to do what he says. I want to help people that have been through things like me. I want women to know that we have a chance; we have a life out there and I want them to know that they have options. How many people are out there who are not getting help? I want to write a book, so people can know the reality. Most people think that women go into the sex industry for sex. If men didn’t pay, women wouldn’t work there. A long time ago, someone said to me that they didn’t think trafficking is real. What do they mean? I am real. I am here.","Criminal justice and victim support statistics, including the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) statistics noted below, confirm that forced prostitution and the commercial sexual exploitation of women and girls continues to be a reality in the Asian region. Rising internet usage rates, the availability of mobile phones, and poverty in many parts of Asia has facilitated online forms of child sexual abuse for profit. Natalie was born in South East Asia, where she was sexually exploited in an illegal brothel. She moved to Australia to work in a legal brothel, but found herself with a large debt for her recruitment, and was being charged for her expenses and as punishment. An NGO named Project Respect helped her to leave the sex industry by helping her to find alternative work."
Nick,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Hungary (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I am a Hungarian and was experiencing hard times. My wife had left me and I lost custody of my children. I had to get work to get my family back. I was offered a job in the UK by a man who travelled with me and three other men by car. We arrived in North East England. I was kept prisoner in rented property by this man. All our personal documents were taken, and we were closely watched. We weren’t allowed out unaccompanied. Several times we were physically assaulted. I felt suicidal. I was taken to work in a pizzeria as a kitchen porter and later at a chicken factory. I received no payment for any of this work.  The traffickers took my money. I was given just enough food not to starve. This carried on for at least 6 months. I tried to escape, but it wasn’t easy, as I was watched all the time. Later I changed my tactics – I got the traffickers to trust me more. I was then told I must work on a building site. There was an opportunity to escape. I did. I went to the police, although I was afraid I’d be sent home. They helped me. I was then placed in the City Hearts shelter in Liverpool. Now I am improving my English and looking forward to a better life than ever before.","The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014.

Nicoleta,2008 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Europe (slavery location),"In the beginning, it was nice. He kept me for himself, he bought me clothes, cosmetics, he was treating me nicely. Then, an ex-girlfriend of his arrived and, for the time, this one stayed with him and he sent me to produce [make money]. My sister was jealous of me because she was making money together with the other girls and I was kept only for him. At that time, we patched things up as I went to make money, too. When his ex-girlfriend left, he kept me for himself again. He was rather old but nice. Only that he used to hit me, to curse me if I didn’t obey him and I didn’t go fetch something (for instance beer from the fridge). I had to be obedient and do the work around the house. I fell in love with a guy from another city. I loved him so much. He said to me: “Our future is abroad. You have to go there, to work as a prostitute, just for a short period of time. With the money you will gain, you will pay my journey to that foreign country. And we will live there.” He had money to pay only for my journey. At first I cried, I didn’t want to, but since I loved him very much, I decided to do what he suggested me.","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. According to the most recent Eurostat findings, European Union (EU) citizens account for 65 percent of identified trafficked victims within Europe. These individuals mostly originate from Eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia. In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Parliament has identified corruption and the judicial system as reform challenges towards accession talks within the EU. In Greece, the turbulent economic situation has increased vulnerability for populations seeking employment and livelihood opportunities.Nicoleta’s account of her sexual exploitation makes clear the role of emotional attachment and manipulation between pimps and those they abuse and enslave."
Nisha,2015 (Narrative date),Forced labour Debt bondage,India (trafficked from) Debt bondage,India (slavery location),"Five years back my husband died. I have 5 daughters and one son. Out of my 5 daughters 3 are married and 2 are unmarried. My son who is the reason behind my life has gone out to work. I don’t know anything about him as to where he has gone. I work in the fields in the village to earn money. I used to get Rs 80 / 100 daily. This was not enough to run the house but I was still happy. My son also sent money to us sometimes.  Meanwhile my daughter started keeping unwell. I took money from a few places and then got her treated and got to know that my daughters kidney wasn’t working. I needed more money for her treatment so I took Rs 5000 from the mahajan and I started getting my daughter treated for her illness. Because of my daughters ill health and the running around I too got sick and I also had to take money for my treatment. Even after so much of treatment there was no improvement in my daughter’s health. I again went to the mahajan’s house for more money but he refused to give and said the previous money I have taken I still haven’t returned so how can I hope to get the other loan... When I heard this I cried at the mahajan’s feet and said that I will return all your money but right now I need some or else my daughter will die. The mahajan then gave me Rs 3000 and said to come with my other daughter and work at their place. This way I will be able to return some money at least. I agreed to the mahajan’s advice and took money from him and came around to work for him from the next day. I got my daughter treated further from that money. My daughter and I had to work for 7 / 8 hours at the mahajan’s place and many times on festivals etc also I had to work for late nights. Our state was getting bad every day. The Rs 50 we got from the mahajan wasn’t enough to run the family. We hardly managed 2 meals from it. On top of it there was an ill child at home. She is not able to get better despite so much money being spent on her. The doctor says that it is urgent to get the kidney’s operation done soon. This requires Rs 50,000 or so of money for the operation. I am so poor that I cannot manage even Rs 500 or so of money. We cannot manage so much money. Nobody will give me money now so that I can get my daughter treated soon. Whenever I tell my owner that I can repay your money by working somewhere else too so let me work anywhere else. If I work anywhere else I would get Rs 150 or Rs 200. The owner then abused us and said when we have to take money we work well and whole heartedly. He said I used to say I will earn money at your place and repay the loan. So what has happened now? He said till I earn money I will have to stay there and work at his place. My state is such that even if I want I cannot change my condition. I am just somehow spending my life miserably and cannot change my condition. Even if I want I cannot do anything for my daughter. My son who can work and give us money doesn’t find out about us and has nothing to do anything with us. ","India has a population of more than 1.3 billion people, there are still at least 270 million people living on less than US$1.90 per day. While laws, systems and attitudes regarding key 'fault lines' such as the caste system, gender and feudalism are rapidly changing, social change of this depth and scale necessarily takes time. In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, including intergenerational bonded labour, forced child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced recruitment into nonstate armed groups and forced marriage. “Nisha’s” story reveals how illness in one family member can result in the debt bondage of a whole family, as the finances required for treatment can necessitate the poor accepting huge amounts of debt, which enter the family into a contract of work with the lender."

Phalla,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Cambodia (slavery location),"I was born in 1988. When I was 20, my father died and we had nobody to provide for our family, so I had to stop my schooling and move in with my grandmother. After living with my grandmother for a month, one day she said, “My baby, tomorrow I will go to visit Kampong Som, do you want to go with me?” I replied, “Yes! Oh, Grandma I want to see the sea.” When we arrived in Kampong Som, my grandma brought me into the village to a nice house, which she said belonged to a friend. We stayed there for a few days and I saw many cars approach the house and then leave with young women. On the 4th day, my grandma introduced me to the house owner and said: “I need my granddaughter to stay here for several days, then I will come to bring her home.” The house owner said: “OK! Don’t worry!” I waited for my grandma for more than several days but she never came back.  I kept looking for my grandma, but the house-owner said she wouldn’t be coming back because she had sold me. She told me I must make money but I couldn’t leave the house. Then, she forced me into the room and locked the door. After that, I didn’t sleep, I cried and listened. That night, I heard someone turn the lock and I said: “Hello! Who are you?” He said he was my Uncle and that he needed me to do something for him. I was afraid and didn’t want to see anyone. I asked him why he’d come here. He said he needed me to go to Heaven with him. Suddenly, I was fully alert. When he touched me, I immediately pushed him away. He pushed me onto the bed and punched me. My mouth began bleeding and I called for help, but no one answered. He put his arm on my mouth to muffle my screams and then ripped off my clothes and raped me. When he’d finished I asked him, “Why have you done this?” He replied, “You are mine for several days. So, I can do whatever I want to you because I gave a lot of money to your boss. Don’t be angry.” Then he left the room. After 3 months in the first brothel, I was sold to a new brothel owner in Kosh Kong. The brothel owner and the “guests” forced me to have sex copying styles they saw in sex videos. In the first month, I had 10 to 15 guests a day. I felt like an animal in the zoo. I couldn’t go anywhere, I never got the money – they gave me drugs, curses and beatings instead. Sometimes, they checked me and took money that some guests passed directly to me. I quickly became a drug user because it helped ease my distress but ultimately the drugs didn’t help me lose my pain. I had very low self-esteem, harmed myself and was quick to anger. I felt hopeless because I didn’t think anything of my life. I was a slave prostitute. After 2 months in Kosh Kong, I was sold to a brothel in Thailand where they forced me to have sex with 20 to 30 men because I was new and pretty. I worked in this brothel for 4 months. One day, I met a Khmer man who helped me escape with 4 others back to Cambodia. I lived with him in Phnom Penh for a week after which he took me to work in a karaoke bar.  At the karaoke bar, I wasn’t allowed to go out anywhere. After a week, I ran away but they arrested me and sent me back. I was put in a room under ground and beaten by the boss for a few days. Then, they sold me to a foreigner. I was with him for 3 days but I didn’t run away because I wanted to gain my boss’ confidence. After another month back at the karaoke bar, the boss trusted me enough to allow me to go out unsupervised. 2 months later, I met a woman that used to live with AFESIP who told me about the organization and gave me their phone number. I went to the clinic to ask for help and now stay at their center, where I study sewing, English and computer. I would like to become a lawyer because I want to help other victims.   ","Cambodia was renowned as a sex tourism destination in the 1990s and this legacy is still prevalent today with women and girls trafficked within the thriving sex industry in Cambodia's major cities. Despite significant attempts to curb CSE, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels. Boys and young men are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation, with many entering the massage industry due to a lack of training and skills. “Phalla” studied to grade 12, then was sold to a brothel by her grandmother. Names have been changed to protect the survivors' privacy."

First in a building which they called the maqarr (headquarters). We were about 150 girls and five women. A man called Salwan took me from there to an abandoned house. He also took my cousin, who is 13 years old; we resisted and they beat us. He took me as his wife by force. I told him I did not want to and tried to resist but he beat me. My nose was bleeding, I could not do anything to stop him. I ran away as soon as I could. Luckily they did not do anything to my cousin, did not force her to marry, and she escaped with me. I went to a doctor here, who said that I was not pregnant and didn’t have any disease, but I can’t forget what happened to me. It is so painful what they did to me and to my family. Da’esh has ruined our lives. My mum gave birth while being held by Da’esh in Tal Afar; now she is being held in Mosul with my little sister and the baby. My 10-year-old brother was separated from my mum and is being held in Tal Afar with my aunt. What will happen to them? I don’t know if I will ever see them again.","ISIS has singled out the Yezidi minority, notably its women and children, for particularly brutal treatment. In August 2014, ISIS fighters abducted hundreds, possibly thousands, of Yezidi men, women and children who were fleeing the IS takeover from the Sinjar region, in the north-west of the country. Hundreds of the men were killed and others were forced to convert to Islam under threat of death. Younger women and girls, some as young as 12, were separated from their parents and older relatives and sold, given as gifts or forced to marry ISIS fighters and supporters. Randa was abducted in August 2014 from her village south of Mount Sinjar with her parents and siblings and scores of other relatives. She was sold or given as a “gift” to a man twice her age who then raped her. Her father was killed along with other male relatives. Her mother, who was heavily pregnant when she was abducted, gave birth in ISIS captivity and was still being held with scores of other women and children from the family when Randa told her story. Some were being held in Syria, others in Iraq. Randa and two of her aunts and two uncles managed to escape at different times.

Rebecca,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was prostituted from 14 till I was 27. I got out because I chose to live. The guy I was with was very violent and I ended up in hospital. I remember the nurse yelled at me for being a prostitute. She sewed me up without anaesthesia and I left the hospital. I was paralysed for 3 days. Those 3 days made me think. I decided to catch a train and leave without knowing where I was going. I was in prostitution on and off for 3 years after that, but that was the beginning of my exit.  I was abused by my step-father from the age of six. I told my mother but she didn’t care. She was just concerned about me not getting pregnant. There was a club in our town where if you were a girl and under 16, the bouncers would let you in for free at the end of the night. My friend, who, like me, was completely fucked up and hated the world, took me there. It was strange because we were told to sit at the bar, not talk to each other and were given lots of cocktails. It all felt very sophisticated. I was 14. On that first night some men took me to a flat and gang raped me for 6 hours. There was a queue of men outside the door; one would finish and another would come in. Now, when I look back, it feels like it was a test to see if I would be a good prostitute. I don’t know how I made it out alive. Although I didn’t go back immediately, I did return with my friend because I didn’t care about myself. She would take the money while I had sex with often violent men. I ‘worked’ there for 3 years. I could hear what was happening in other rooms and would think, at least what’s happening to me isn’t as bad. You have to survive. If I saw someone else looking scared, I’d think at least that’s not me. It’s hard for me to live with the fact that I know some women disappeared—I feel guilty. I was often truant from school but attended till I was 18. From 17 upwards, an average day was trying not to sleep as much as possible. I’d go to pubs and have people buy me drinks. There was a regular at the pub who was known to be violent to women and to pick up prostitutes. I used to be seen with him in the pub, but no-one ever said anything to me. I’m not saying they could have stopped me, but they didn’t even try. Loads of men who were abusive to me were white and English, but there were also men from other nationalities and countries. It was the time of the anti-apartheid movement. Outwardly they portrayed themselves as so good. Some would actually talk to me about human rights while they were doing horrible things to me! One punter (slang term for men who buy sex) actually resuscitated me and then carried on doing what he was doing to me. I was getting to the point where I wanted to kill the punters or myself. Always being surrounded by people who wanted to kill me made me think I should commit suicide as that would piss them off! I would see injuries on me after punters had used me and not know where they’d come from. I mentally closed down. My body had been pushed to the limit but it didn’t die. At the time I thought I was choosing punters, but now I realise that men knew they could offer me money and that they could be violent towards me; it was a small town and they knew through word of mouth. Now when I look back, I see that there was a hell of a lot of organisation behind what happened to me. For the longest time I hated going to the cinema as normally punters would take me there to have sex. When men found out I read, some would buy me books like Lolita and Marquis de Sade. I once set fire to a copy of Lolita. My step-father used to read Marquis de Sade to me at bedtime.  I also did that escort “girlfriend” thing, which is a total mind fuck because even if they treat you well, they still get all the sex they want any way they want. Many wanted to see me regularly. One guy kept me in his flat for 8 days. That messed with my head because I would start thinking like he was my boyfriend, when he wasn’t. He would lock me up in the flat before he’d go out. We’d watch American football on TV. If he saw me looking bored he’d rape me. At least men who are cold and violent don’t fuck with your brain! What are UK and European lawmakers doing about sexual exploitation and trafficking? As an escort most of the guys who bought me were very rich - many were training to become leaders in their own countries. Some of them are now in positions of power. People disconnect prostitution from other rights abuses. It makes me cynical about governments and those that run them. Punters are so arrogant. If you’re going to be a bastard, it’s easier to stick to prostituted women because no one really listens to or believes prostitutes. One reason men are angry with prostitutes is because they can’t destroy them. Most men don’t want to use condoms- they don’t come to prostitutes for that. If someone had given me a condom I wouldn’t have had the self-esteem to use one. I didn’t feel like I deserved to live or not get a disease. I look back at the escorting and think those punters really hated me. A lot of men were in denial about what they were doing so they would pay me with food or alcohol or give me a bed for the night. The guys who thought they were gentle or talked a lot, I hated the most. They wanted to know things about me as a human being, while they wanted to do all these things to me. I hate the punters and the way they make so many excuses for what they do. I hate that what they do is justified by society. I don’t know how any man can justify buying a human being either, just so they can have an orgasm!  I hate that they made me feel I should be grateful to them. I feel like they put poison in me. I started a blog just after the 2006 Ipswich murders (I’ve always noticed they only report these things when it’s a serial killer and then it’s always about the guy not the women). In Manchester I got lots of backlash from people who talk about prostitution being a choice and people who say I couldn’t have been a prostitute because I’m middle-class or too educated. Within a month, however, I started getting a strong response and now I use it to be political and to talk about the trauma associated with prostitution. I also contribute to Sex Trafficking Survivors United online forum. I campaign for abolition and changing laws.",UK children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Children in the care system and unaccompanied migrant children are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Rebecca was sexually abused and exploited as a child and only left her situation as an adult when she experienced such violence that she ended up in hospital. Here she discusses how societal gender norms contribute to and justify abuse to women and girls.
Rohiti,2013 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,United Kingdom (slavery location) Indonesia (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I grew up in Indonesia. When my single mother became sick I had to find work. There was nothing in my village. I went to Hong Kong, hoping to earn enough to support her. I was put in charge of three children 24 hours a day, with much housework. I worked for 7 months but wasn’t paid. They said I must pay off the debt for my travel first. My employers then arranged a ‘holiday’ to the UK. It turned out to be 16 hours’ work a day, sleeping on the floor, always on call. I was ordered to care for the elderly grandparents as well. That was the last straw. I ran away, despite the fear of being homeless and deported. Kalayaan helped me. I cannot get a new job because my visa has expired. I cannot stay here. I must go home with nothing. The family who exploited me gets off “scott free”.","Significant numbers of domestic workers are brought to the UK each year, including an unknown number who travel into and out of the UK with the families they are working for in other countries. In the UK, migrant domestic workers are currently tied to their employer by the immigration rules, increasing their vulnerability to exploitative practices by dissuading workers to come forward and risk deportation. Kalayaan, a UK-based NGO for migrant domestic workers, found high levels of exploitative treatment from employers in a 2015 study of their domestic worker clients. However, the consistently higher rates of abuse experienced by those on tied visas indicate an urgent need to review the current system. Rohiti was exploited in domestic work in Hong Kong and the UK, before running away. She explains that she is unable to pursue her employers because she is unable to stay in the UK after her visa expired."
Ronny,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"As a survivor of human trafficking here in the United States, it is difficult to hear people talk about the issue as if it only happens in some remote part of the world. It’s difficult because I know that a lack of awareness contributes to the persistence of human trafficking in the United States, and is a barrier to prevention in the form of appropriate policies. In some ways, I consider myself a “blessed” survivor of labor trafficking in the U.S. because my ordeal was relatively short. In 2009, I responded to an ad for a housekeeping job in a Kansas hotel while living in my native Dominican Republic. When I arrived, however, I was told by my trafficker that the only available job was in a Huntsville, Alabama DVD-manufacturing company. Once I was lured by the hotel job advertisement, I borrowed $4,000 to pay my recruiter, purchase airfare and pay necessary visas fees. While working at the manufacturing company I was charged high fees and deductions from my low salary, which kept me too poor to flee or return home. I had become a slave to my employers.  During that time, I lived in a very small one-bedroom apartment with two other people. We each paid $300 in rent per month to our employer, though the employer paid just $450 in total to the landlord. After living with intimidation, withheld wages and threats of deportation and violence against my family, I escaped a few months later. My ordeal ended thanks to my landlord. After she first sent a notification that I had not paid rent, I showed her my pay stub proving that my employer had been deducting rent from my paycheck. She recognized that something illegal was happening and called my employer to question him. His response prompted her to ask me if I would like to speak with the media, and I was interviewed by the Huntsville newspaper. After fleeing my employer, I found a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who believed my story, and provided assistance and information that helped me navigate the system and get on my feet.  Since regaining my freedom, I have spoken with many other trafficking victims who survived years — decades even — of horror and abuse because they did not have the good fortune to encounter knowledgeable citizens or informed police officers. I have made it a priority to help others and, last year, President Obama appointed me to serve on the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. It is an honor to serve with other survivors, but one that comes with great responsibility to educate the public as well as convince policymakers to combat and prevent human trafficking in all its forms. As a first step, last October the Advisory Council issued its first Annual Report, which includes 15 policy recommendations that could help put an end to modern slavery in the United States. While the recommendations cover all forms of human trafficking, three specifically target the Department of Labor’s (DOL) approach to combating labor trafficking — the form of modern slavery I endured. The first DOL recommendation encourages the department to increase trafficking investigations in industries like hospitality, construction and agriculture, that commonly utilize low income, seasonal or temporary workers. These industries are often trafficking hot spots and employ recruiters to fill labor gaps. I have heard countless stories similar to mine with victims being lured to the United States with promises of good jobs only to be forced into labor in hotels, restaurants, factories or farms, or into the sex industry.  Investigations are critical to ensuring that employers are not engaging in human trafficking when they hire seasonal, low income or temporary workers. Investigations of workplaces where employees make under the minimum wage and are not hired directly by the company they work for, but by a third party or contractor, are particularly critical — I know firsthand how vulnerable these workers are to human trafficking. The report’s second labor trafficking-related recommendation calls on the U.S. Congress and the DOL to remove barriers that keep trafficking survivors from accessing employment assistance programs.  Financial counseling, skills training and other employment services are critical to help many trafficking survivors achieve the full recovery and success they deserve. Our report recommends that the DOL expand the current fields of vocational training and eliminate the need for background checks, which can unfairly block participation by survivors who were forced to take illegal actions such as performing involuntary sex services or producing or packing illegal products while in fact being victims of horrendous crimes.  Our report also recommends that Congress act to remove age restrictions that prohibit trafficking survivors from receiving critical employment assistance. The only program currently available is a one-size-fits-all employment program for young people who are 16 to 24 years old. For a trafficking survivor who is in his or her twenties, thirties or even forties but has spent years as a trafficking victim, employment services can be a critical part of a full recovery. Importantly, the report also recommends that the DOL work with the Advisory Council to create survivor-informed training for all department staff. All survivors have faced the fear and stigma that comes with modern slavery, and recognize the signs of human trafficking. By sharing our expertise with the DOL staff and working with them to train other staff, we can help them recognize the signs of human trafficking in the workplace. This builds upon the premise that awareness is a key part to prevention.  I hope the Advisory Council’s recommendations are fully considered by the new congress and incoming administration. Freedom should not rely on chance, and never before has a new president been inaugurated with such a concrete, survivor-informed plan available to help put an end to modern slavery in the United States. ","In the US, slavery occurs in both legal and illicit industries, including in commercial sex, hospitality, traveling sales crews, agriculture, seafood, manufacturing, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, health care, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, drug smuggling and distribution, and child care and domestic work. Individuals who entered the United States with and without legal status have been identified as trafficking victims. Government officials, companies, and NGOs have expressed concern about the risk of human trafficking and slavery in global supply chains, including in federal contracts. Victims originate from almost every region of the world.
Ronny’s account mentions some common features of this kind of slavery: a false promise of a lucrative job, withheld wages, debt bondage that is made difficult or impossible to pay off, and threats against the worker and their family. Ronny has become an advocate for survivors of slavery in the United States."
Rosanna,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My father died even before I was born and seven months after my birth my mother also died. I was cared for then by my father’s daughter, whom I fondly called Mamay. My mother was a mistress. Due to circumstances, my Mamay went to Manila and I was left under the care of my father’s first wife. She treated me badly, and she would often introduce me to her friends as the daughter of a sinful woman. When I was growing up, I felt shame and bad about myself.  I was 18 when I ran away from home and stayed with my friend who introduced me to an old woman who was responsible for buying my boat ticket to Cebu City. This woman told me that I would be working in a sari-sari store [a small convenience outlet]. I met her in the morning and that night she and I boarded a big boat bound for Cebu City. Before we left she gave me PHP500 which I used to buy things for me. I was a little bit puzzled that my acceptance as a store keeper had been so easy and I thought maybe the store owner was not good and other negative thoughts came into my mind. On the other hand, I told myself that it was a good opportunity for me. During the boat trip, the old woman told me some of the names of girls who came from my town whom she had also brought to Cebu City. I knew some of the girls and I thought their work must be good because when they came home, they were transformed into beautiful women and looked wealthy.  Upon arriving at the seaport, I was bought breakfast and after, we boarded a taxi and went to the place where I would have to work. The place was congested with many houses. We came up into a big house which I noticed had plenty of small rooms but no store. Inside the house were plenty of women who were sleeping like the dead. I made friends with some of the girls in that house and they explained to me that later in the evening I had to take a shower and change to new clothes. I wondered why. However, in one of the corners of the house I saw a small space where bottles of beers were sold. I thought that must be the store. That evening, I observed that the girls had their showers and were in good form already. They wore skimpy dresses and make-up. A few moments later I saw the girls were engaged in small talk with men who came to the house. They would go inside the room and after a while they came out again. I said to myself, “I don’t understand what is going on.” Then some of my friends asked whether I was not told that I was in Kamagayan [the red light district of Cebu City]. I did not know the place. So they told me that it was a place where paid sex was done and pimps would come to bring customers. Every customer would do business with the pimp, and the pimp would give us PHP50 for every customer we served. I was shocked. I discovered later that the old woman was the owner of the house and her children were her assistants. They took turns watching over us because they were the ones who collected the money from the patrons whom the girls had served. That first night, I was assigned to a customer. I cried a lot. When I was entertaining the customer I asked myself, “Is this really my fate, my destiny, to be like this?” When I came out of the room, I was still crying and the gay son of the old woman scolded me and sent me upstairs to sleep. The next day was again the same, we slept and in the afternoon entertained customers. My friend told me that she was able to entertain 20 customers on the previous night. I said, “What kind of life is this? But since I am already here, I have to embrace it because this is my destiny.” Every night plenty of customers came, one after the other without rest. Each time, I went inside the comfort room and washed and served again a new customer. It was tiresome, so all the time I used shabu [methamphetamine] to ease my emotional pain. It was not the physical aspects that caused me so much pain but the emotional. Sometimes I would make jokes with the customers just to ease the pain. I could entertain at least 15 in one night. Sometimes, customers would demand that I do good service because they paid extra money or gave a ‘tip’ to the watchers. The watchers got the ‘tip’, not me.  The agreement with the owner was that for every customer I would get PHP50. However, this amount was not paid to me immediately. It would come to me at the end of the week after calculation of my food, drugs and other things they had given me. Sometimes I ended up with no money collected and I even incurred a debt – practically, I got no cash pay for one week’s work. The shabu was charged at PHP300 per pack and they made us take at least two packs of it every night. Because I would get no money at the end of the week, the owner would at times offer me a cash advance. These cash advances piled up and I ended up with heaps of debt. I often times got penalties because of some actions that I made. These included not doing good service for PHP500; if I quarrelled with customers that would be another PHP500; if I did not display myself very well, another PHP500; and so on and so forth. All of these penalties compounded my debts to the employer. One day, I thought that I would need to be clever in order to get money. From then on, when a customer demanded to play with my breast, I charged him PHP50 for each so I could get extra money. I told my customers that they paid for sex, not for playing with my breasts. That strategy made me laugh. Another clever trick that I did with my customers, especially those I sensed were first timers or students, was I would tell them I would have sex with them with my shirt on because they had paid only for my vagina. If they wanted to play with the upper parts of my body, I charged them PHP500, and an additional PHP500 if I led. My customers varied from office workers to labourers to butchers, to men from the rural areas to students, but I didn’t like foreigners. As time went by, I made many regular customers. They would line up until I was done serving the person who had come in earlier. Often these customers would say, “I’m next.” I just laughed at them. To me it was not good but I accepted my destiny. Sometimes I used shabu [methamphetamine] even if I was serving a customer. I cried a lot. Usually I served one customer at a time but there was one instance that six of them came into the room. Only one had sex with me but my hands were grabbed to hold another one’s penis and others were touching me. It was horrible. I did not know who I was that time. I really pitied and felt very sorry for myself but I could not do anything. I should say that those regular customers came for sex, not because they wanted to see me or cared for me. There was even one time when my dress was stained with blood because the customer just came from his job as a butcher – his body still had pig’s blood on it – while others dropped by before going to the Carbon Market [Cebu’s largest farmers’ market] with baskets in their hands.  One time I felt so abused that I quarrelled with my customer but instead of protecting me, the owner scolded me. I said to her, “How come you favour the customer when I am the one who makes you live, I am your source of money? You get half of my earnings and yet you are not the one who is prostituted, it’s me who provides the service, if I do not work, you cannot eat.” I said, “If I have some responsibilities towards you, you have also some responsibilities towards me, because you said when you recruited me that I would work in a decent place but you deceived me and brought me here.”  I was also penalised when I served a customer for more than 10 minutes. If the customer still had money he would be charged for the extension, but if he had none, then it would be charged against my pay at the end of the week. I told the owner, “You are good only at collecting the money. You did not care what happened to me inside the room, I was treated like a pig.” After our quarrel, the owner’s blood pressure got high. “Good for her,” I said. I was in the red light district for a year and a half. It is not true that prostituted women like sex and that that is why they do that work. I was in that place because I felt no one loved me and I had nowhere to go, and because I was so addicted to shabu [methamphetamine].","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism. Rising internet usage rates, the availability of mobile phones and poverty has fostered online child sexual exploitation. 
Rosanna travelled to Cebu City under the false pretences of working in a convenience shop, but was instead sexually exploited for a year and a half before she was able to leave the situation."
Rowena,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Rowena and I have nine siblings. I grew up in a farm environment and attended school up to elementary level but I wish I could have finished all my schooling. When I was three years old I was raped by a neighbour but I did not tell anyone about it. However, when I was seven, people around me became alarmed because I would say I was fearful of playing outside in case a stranger had sex with me. Then I revealed to my mother that I had been raped when I was three and she was angry with me for not telling her earlier.  From the ages of seven to 10 I thought that I liked sex and I would describe myself as craving sex. I would have sex with friends of my papa and whoever came and wanted to have sex with me. When I was 10 I was sexually harassed by my father and again when I was 12. I wish this could have been different because I wanted my father to be good to us, gentle, because I really needed a father’s love. My mother frequently stayed away from home looking for work so that she could provide food for us.  At 14, I ran away from home and I found solace with my friends. I started using drugs. I had sex with boyfriends, I had sex with taxi drivers – I gave them blow jobs and more because I needed money. There was even a time that my friend sold me in Cebu City. At 15 years old I was rescued by an NGO. They took me to a shelter, but I ran away because I really needed money. I escaped with two other girls and they took me to Kamagayan [the red light district of Cebu City]. It was the first time I had been there. They used drugs and gave me some on credit. I did not like the environment and I said that I would not stay there, but my friends told me to stay and make plenty of money. That night I had five customers. When I returned to find my friends they were gone. Someone advised me that my mother was looking for me and I believed them and followed them, but it was only a ploy by another recruiter to make money out of me. I stayed with that recruiter for three months and I used drugs every day as a way of protecting myself from shame. Because I was a minor, they hid me in a boarding house and I was treated like a VIP. It cost more for customers to be entertained by me. When I was working there, even with the taxi drivers all I could think of was, “I am dirty.” Even if I did sexual services with them, all I could think of is, “I am dirty.” That is maybe because I was raped when I was young. When I would take a bath I stayed in the bathroom for a very long time because I wanted to scratch off all the feelings that I am dirty. I spent a lot of time being fearful, especially when the customers seemed to be bad guys. I just submitted all the way with no complaints. I feel so very submissive to guys with bad temperaments. I do not have the power to say no.  I used drugs all the time I was there because when I take drugs it makes me high; I feel stronger and I’m not ashamed to entertain my customers. It gives me strength – even if I have many customers I will not become tired. But when I do not take the drug, I am shy, I don’t want to have sex. I never made any money the whole time I was at Kamagayan. It was the managers who made all the money. After three months I ran away and found the Welcome House and they took good care of me. What greatly motivated me to run away was I realised that I was deceived by them. They made money out of me, but I didn’t have a single cent, so that was great deception and I didn’t want that and I realised that this was the end.  I did not really go to Kamagayan to get money, I really just wanted to get out of my house because I was afraid that my father would rape me again. People should not judge those girls who go to Kamagayan, because each girl has her own reason for doing it. It may be because of poverty, it may be because of problems, it may be because of sex. It could be because of anything, so people should not generalise that girls are just paid to do sex and they like it. That’s not really true. Today I am proud of myself because I started to file a case against the man who raped me at three. He is now in prison. Once I filed a case against him, many other victims turned up. Some people think that I am brave for doing that. I am overwhelmed with happiness that he is now in prison because he sexually harassed me for many years. But I did not proceed with negotiations for him to pay damages because it would leave his family with nothing as he had so many victims. Sometimes I still think that I am dirty and I know that this is a result of my bad experiences. My anger about those bad experiences meant that I had bad emotions, but I keep getting told that I am not a bad person and that I am not dirty by those who are helping me to recover. I think trafficking happens because of people who want money, who want to make big money. If I had not been trafficked I would not be here in this place today. I would not be having this new kind of life now. The trafficking experience helped me to be nearer to God. Before, I did not consider it a very important activity to go to church or communicate with God but after this experience I am nearer to God. Really, this experience of being trafficked strengthened me. Before I would say in my mind, “Oh, the trafficked girls are flirts, that’s why they were trafficked,” but now I know they were not flirts because I was trafficked as well. Today I am more dedicated to pray for those girls who are trafficked. I have survived many trials, even as a child I survived because I was determined to live. As I grew up with plenty of problems I cannot avoid thinking about committing suicide. There were plenty of times that I planned this but I feared that this would not be good. It would only create more problems for my family. They would have to find money to bury me. So I just survive. I found strength in God. I just hold on to God.  I am only 19 now but I am proud of myself, proud that I survived the many trials in my life. Although people will look down on trafficked women I am proud that I am a survivor. I am proud that I am here to support my younger siblings and that I can finance them through a decent job. I am proud that despite not finishing my schooling I have a decent job as a seamstress. I am proud that I mingle with my superiors, higher up people who have good positions, and that I am able to receive their occasional reprimands calmly.  In the future I would like to become a social worker. Last year I attended school but I did not finish because I cannot really manage full-time work and school because I am too sleepy. But next year maybe I will go to school and then I plan to go to college and start social work. I will then have a big house with plenty of children and I will fill my house with children who I am helping and I will have a big bakery. I will be known as a person in the community who has dignity and I will be popular and respected in the community because I am good. Deep inside I want a child only, I’m not really sure if I want a husband, unless that man would really love me as I want. I am very much convinced that I can reach all my goals. I will be patient in having all these dreams come true, but do you know what? I am tempted sometimes to drink and to use drugs and to gallivant around with my friends. I am only a human being, I dream of these things. Some- times I am strong, but the temptations are there, sometimes I am tempted. I am just a human being. I am proud that I have chosen good friends now. Before my friends were drug addicts and drunkards, but now I still have friends and they are proud that I can say no.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Rozina,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation War slavery,Iraq (trafficked from) War slavery,Iraq (slavery location),"I have come to this conference from Kocho village in the Sinjar District, which is in Northern Iraq. I am one of the Yazidi girls who survived ISIS. Nearly all of my family, my mother, my father, two of my brothers, were all killed. I have one brother left and my sister who also recently escaped captivity. Amongst you, here with you, I feel strong. When I return I don’t know if I will feel the same. I was kidnapped on August 14, 2014 and was held captive in Mosul until May 2015. I was being moved from one place to another and the person keeping guard was planting explosive devices for ISIS as we moved. I managed to escape and now I am in a camp with other Yazidi people. I would like to do something for my people. We are a kind people, we are a closed religion. We don’t do any harm, we don’t proselytize. Yet we have no one protecting us, we are attacked for our faith and because we are not Muslim. They [ISIS] killed all the men, they raped all the women, they stole all our wealth. I don’t know what more they can take from us. They kidnapped nearly all of us [in my village], and killed all but 16 men. Children between 12 and 17 were sent to institutes* and those under 12 stayed with their families. Many women were taken as sex slaves in captivity. In other areas, Yazidi males were forced to convert to Islam and if they refused they were killed. This was not just ISIS, it was also other tribes.  I would like to be an activist and talk about women’s rights. I have finished sixth grade and would like to finish my studies but I can’t continue in the camp. The camp is my home and my lifeline for now. *Editor’s Note: These “institutes” are described as centers where ISIS aims to ‘re-educate’ young boys, primarily. They force them to convert and, according to Rozina and other activists, try to turn them into fighters.","The Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking people who live principally in northern Iraq – where there are around 500,000-600,000. There are another 200,000 settled in other parts of the world. The Yazidis have faced extreme persecution and marginalization in their home communities within Iraq due to their religion and beliefs. Starting in August 2014, ISIS has continuously targeted Yazidis in Iraq and Syria in its campaign to “purify” the region: kidnapping, raping, and forcing girls and women into sexual slavery, and murdering men in mass killings. In 2015, news reports revealed the discovery of a mass grave believed to have remains from more than 70 Yazidi women from Kocho village, where “Rozina” is from."

The children of our masters are all educated, officials, among them there is a great soldier, a policeman, teachers, they all work in the state.  I always try to get my brothers to rebel, my mother and my sister. I managed with my brothers, Bilal in particular, who I got to leave his mistress, Mahjouba mint Legreyve. But I failed with my mother who was afraid to leave Mariem mint Sidi Salem, her mistress. And then some time ago I learned that there is a man named Biram, freeing slaves, making them Haratin. I went to ask Rahma mint Legreyve to give me my little sister, Youma. Rahma threatened me with having me imprisoned if I request this again. I was afraid and left; this was a few weeks ago. Then I learned that Biram, a man I'd heard of but had never seen anywhere was coming from Nema and was going to stop in our city, Chogar. I asked a Hartani in Chogar, named Lekbeid, to transmit my message discreetly to Biram. I asked him to help me release my mother and my sister from the yoke of slavery to the Legreyve family. I do not know if Lekbeid forwarded my request to Biram, but a few days later, last Thursday, my brother Bilal, who lives in Nouakchott, told me by phone that he was helped by Biram and that he complained against Rahma mint Legreyve that maintaining our sister Youma into slavery in Nouakchott. He said that Rahma is now in prison, and the other members of the family of our master will join her in jail and that we no longer need to fear anything and my mother and I can come and help in the complaint, and stay in Nouakchott and live together. Immediately after that I left Chogar quietly, with my mother to join my brother Bilal and my sister Youma  I am attached to my mother, my sister and brothers and I filed a complaint with the justice of Mauritania against this family who dominated and exploited us all our lives without rest or pay. I also ask Biram and his organization to help us in our approach. ","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives. People in slavery come from the Haratine ethnic group, historically enslaved by White Moors. They can be bought and sold, or given as gifts, and face a lifetime of exploitation and abuse. Rape of female slaves is common and their children also become slaves. They are Muslims, and many believe that it is Allah’s wish for them to be enslaved because they are told that their paradise is bound to their Master. In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem. Saleck was born a slave but has worked to not only free himself and his family from their “masters,” but also to help pursue the prosecution of those they formerly served. There are narratives from Saleck’s family members to be found in the archive."
Salma M.,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"I am a slave by descent, as part of the inheritance of Mariem mint Sidi Salem, she acquired me when I was a young child and since then I have never known either my father or mother. For as long as I can remember, I have worked as a domestic slave for my masters, Mariem Mint Sidi Salem Ould Cheikh and her late husband Legreyve, of the tribe Oulad Ahmed, their son Mohamed, Ethmane, Sidi, Dah, Sid'Ahmed; their daughters, Rahma, and Miss Mahjouba. My children, for whom I know no paternity, are all born with my masters. This family are their slaves; they do that work for their masters as I work for them. They have never known education, or marital status, or recreation, or rest. My child Bilal was given as a wedding gift to the daughter of my master Mahjouba mint Legreyve, mint Youma my daughter was given to Salma Rahma mint Legreyve for use at home. My children were able to break the bond with our masters, but my daughter and I have not been able to do so. My daughter stayed with her mistress, Rahma mint Legreyve. Yesterday morning, when my son and his brother, Bilal, came to lodge a complaint against Rahma to claim his sister. I, since my childhood, have served my mistress, Mariem mint Sidi Salem until yesterday [February 6 2013], late at night, my eldest son, Saleck Ould Salma, came to inform me that I could be free now, and get my daughter to live united with my children. My son informed me that his brother, Bilal, filed a complaint against our master, and that some Biram could help us regain our freedom and to start a family together and independently.  Long ago, I remember an uncle of mine called Bilal and a brother to me called Bilal, came to solicit my masters family Ehel Legreyve, to take me with them and live in Senegal. They came to claim me in Chogar, but the Moors refused to accede to their request and they left. I think they live in a city called Thies Senegal. To work with my masters, I never received any consideration or compensation. I filed a complaint against all members of the family who kept me in my life as a slave and the slavery-like practices they have imposed on my children. I demand my freedom, my daughter, and claims and repairs to entire states and trust and power of attorney to my two sons Saleck and Bilal, I also sought support from Biram for my protection and that of my children.","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives.

Samantha,2009 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Malaysia (slavery location),"To help my parents survive poverty, I entertained the idea of working abroad. There was no chance for me to land a job locally, having no college education to speak of. Even college graduates have a hard time locating work. I was recruited by a man named Joseph to work in Malaysia as a band singer, with an offer of a monthly salary of 60,000 pesos (US$ 1,260). I was recruited along with two other girls who also aspired to migrate for work. Joseph transported me in 2006 by ship and we landed in Sandakan, Malaysia, where a man named Harry met us at the port to proceed to Miri. Another Chinese man met us and collected our passports for a chop (seal) to pass through the immigration. We went to Kota Kinabalu after paying a fee. From Miri, we went by plane to Kota Kinabalu. A woman met us at the airport and we took a bus to Kuching. We sang at a club; we worked but did not receive any pay. In fact, we were asked to pay our debt. The cost of travel was charged to us, including the chop fees for the passports; in addition payment was collected from us for power and water bills which were initially promised to be free. When we asked for a new job with higher pay, we were given jobs as guest relation officers (a euphemism for entertainer) in Kalampai, which was illegal. We accepted the jobs because there was no way for us to pay the debts claimed by the woman, and for us to go home for good. We worked hard every night, yet we did not receive any pay for days except for a few Malaysian ringgit to buy shampoo and soap but not enough to buy food. Then we found ourselves eventually sold to various men. At the beginning, we were told that they would not force us to go out with men but later on, we were scolded if we would not go out with them. We suffered also from constant stress as we were periodically checked upon and raided by the Malaysian police. We wanted to run away but could not go because they kept our passports; we were warned that if we dared to go we would be taken to a gangster. One night the police raided a night club I was at. I was able to hide on the terrace near an air-conditioned unit where I hung clothes from the clothesline to cover myself. All of the women except me were taken and arrested. Their passports were confiscated. They were photographed. There were media reporters. My passport was surrendered by our house caretaker who thought that I had been arrested with the other women. I asked for the intervention of the Embassy of the Philippines. In fact, I called up and asked to be rescued but the Embassy just told me that there was no budget. I went to the immigration office in Kuching to get an exit pass. To my surprise, I was detained instead of being issued an exit pass. The officer took my statement of a lost passport and I declared that an agent had recruited me from the Philippines. I was not detained for long because my boyfriend who accompanied me paid the officer in exchange for my freedom. Immediately, my boyfriend bought a ticket for my return to the Philippines. Upon arrival in Davao in 2007, I was able to make an affidavit of complaint and produced evidence of illegal recruitment and attendant issues. With the help of the Center for Overseas Workers in Davao, I filed a case against the recruiter, but unfortunately he could not be found.","Foreign workers constitute more than 20 percent of the Malaysian workforce and typically migrate voluntarily—often illegally—to Malaysia from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries, mostly in pursuit of better economic opportunities. Some of these migrants are subjected to forced labor or debt bondage by their employers, employment agents, or informal labor recruiters when they are unable to pay the fees for recruitment and associated travel. Samantha was recruited from the Philippines for entertainment work in Malaysia but had her passport confiscated and was not paid for her work. She was able to escape during a police raid. Her account describes police corruption and a lack of help forthcoming from the Embassy of the Philippines."
Sar,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Southeast Asia (slavery location),"All that I can remember of my early childhood is that I was happy because I was with my lola [grandmother]. Although I loved my lola, I missed my mother. I have regrets about my mother having left me because she chose a second family over me. She is a mother in name only. I was left in the care of my lola and lived with my uncles and aunties. However, I was very loved by them and they were my only family. My lola was very loving, caring and patient. Even when she had no food for herself she prioritised me. I have more respect for my family than I do my mother and father. My lola paid for my education in elementary school and my aunties and uncles paid for my secondary schooling. I have a fond memory of undertaking scout activities as a child. Once we had a family campaign and my lola and I bonded. It was so memorable because we had fun and joined in the games.  In high school I was influenced by the bad habits of my peers but I was happy because at the closing of each year I was included in the top students in the class – my lola would pin a ribbon on me. My lola would describe me as spoilt but not a brat. I am someone who likes to catch attention in a beautiful way, always showing love and affection, I am the one who always wants to be cuddled. But also I am so shy; little by little I am getting over the shyness.  When I was 24 I was trafficked to a country neighbouring the Philippines. I cannot find a reason as to why I was trafficked. It just happened. Even my family cannot understand why I was trafficked. Although we were not financially well off, we were content. What I want is only what I can get. I am not a social climber. Maybe I am just a random victim of trafficking. Maybe one big reason was that at that time my lola was hospitalised and we needed big money because our income did not suffice for the hospitalisation. So I grabbed the opportunity, the promise. It all began when I was a working as a promo girl selling beauty products in a local mall. A friend asked me if I would like to go to a neighbouring country to work and get better pay. My friend told me I could earn money there as a band member. My pay at the mall in Cebu was very small, so I thought this would be an opportunity to earn money for my lola’s medication. So I arranged with this friend to attend band practice. I had a good singing voice and five of us had band practice for a month. Then it was time to depart. The manager of the band made all the arrangements, including our airfares and passports. We were told to meet at Cebu’s domestic airport. I was a little confused because I thought we should be departing from the international section. Our departure time was supposed to be 11pm but we had to be at the domestic terminal at 4pm so I started to think something was not good, as if we were hiding in the domestic departure area.  When we arrived in the neighbouring country we were passed quickly through immigration and then we were taken in a van to the house that we would be staying in. After we arrived at the house we had a sleep and within three days we were told to just do our band practice.  On the third day we were brought to a bar and they said we had to observe. I was shocked by what I saw there. The bar was very dark. I expected that I would be singing in a band inside a hotel in a decent place, but the bar we went into was very dirty, the room was very dark and the only lit area was where the wines were placed in the bar.  When the customers came in the women who were there ahead of us would take drugs because these customers would just have sex in that area. People seemed to be high on drugs. We started singing in that bar but there was no one listening. We just seemed to be singing to ourselves! I had in my mind also that there was an expectation that we would also be prostituted. We had only been there for a couple of days when we were told that we must dress up in sexy clothing. They took our cell phones and passports but we managed to hide one cell phone. I did not feel comfortable at all. One time the brother of the owner of the bar came in and saw me and I thought he loved me but he said, “Take off your jacket, why are you ashamed?” I was not very comfortable at all because I was still a virgin and I had no experience. One of the employers told us to take drugs so that we could make plenty of money and we would not be ashamed when we entertained customers. I didn’t want to do any of this and so that’s when we planned to escape.  There was a Dutch seaman, a customer at the bar, who I told my problem to. He gave me the key to his hotel so that I could escape there and he could help me. When the five of us arrived at his hotel he was angry because he did not expect me to bring companions and he was afraid that he would be caught or implicated. The Dutchman consulted his Filipina friend about us who advised that we should go directly to immigration. So we all arrived at the immigration office and told them our plight. However, they just teased us and said, “Why do you complain when you have been given food, shelter and clothes?” The immigration people told us if we wanted to report a problem we should go to the police. Again, the police just laughed at us. They mocked us because we just carried our possessions in a plastic bag. They told us to return to the immigration department. The immigration van transported us back to the immigration department where we discovered our employer was there. The head of immigration told us, “Your employer is very kind to you. You should go back to the bar and you should go back to your employer.” We pleaded with him not to force us to go back but they insisted they were closing and locked us out of the office. We were crying and pleading for their help but the other people in immigration just laughed at us. We cried and even laid down on the floor but the head of immigration ordered us out to face our employer. We linked arms together as we were scared that we would be pulled away one by one. Our employer tried to coerce us to go with him. He said we should just have discussed our problems with him. He tried to get us to come with him but we all ran away. We pulled up a taxi and had him drive very far away from that place to another town where we stayed in a pension house and got back in touch with the Dutchman who linked us up with a Filipino woman in that town. She offered her house for us to stay in whilst we sorted out papers to get home to the Philippines.  After three weeks of staying with her she changed her attitude and demanded money. She offered to prostitute us so that we could pay her our living expenses. Some of my friends agreed to be prostituted but I did not.  We made contact with a different immigration service and they were far more supportive. They retrieved our passports from our managers but did not get any money from them. The manager told immigration that we were liars. It took six weeks of negotiations to arrive back safely in Cebu. The mayor of Cebu intervened on our behalf because some of us had contacted our families and told them of our situation. The mayor paid for our tickets home to Cebu. The Philippine embassy facilitated this process. When I arrived home in Cebu, I just wanted to escape because people kept asking what happened. I didn’t want to explain it to people so I just stayed down south for about 12 months. I think I was in shock. Even today I am still asking myself why I did that and I am shocked because I cannot imagine me doing that and having that trouble. Even my aunty asks me why I travelled to a neighbouring country when we could have managed financially. I regret my decision to take up the offer to earn money overseas. I think the first offer from a friend was part of a chain of traffickers. I don’t think my friend really knew what would happen to me. She just received money for recruiting me. It’s her aunty who is in jail now for trafficking offences.  The first thing I learned about trafficking is if you are in a difficult situation you should be sensible, think, and not be influenced by fear, you should focus on what to do. And also I learned that for my part, I should not be so innocent, like I am dumb, or like you just don’t know what to do, because you will easily become prey to deception. But I am proud of being a fighter even if I have plenty of problems. I stand ready to face my trials and even when I had my problems I don’t cry. It’s my dream now to graduate in hotel management. My studies are being supported by an international organisation. My only dream now is to have a stable income. I don’t care about high wages, just a stable income to support my son. I don’t even dream to get married.","The Philippines has one of the largest migratory populations with their national economy largely depending on Overseas Filipino Worker's (OFW) remittances. The OFWs have been deemed the 'new heroes' of the Philippines' economy. However, some OFWs are subjected to exploitation throughout the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Sar was lured abroad with promises of well-paid work, which she wanted to help pay for her grandmother’s hospitalisation. Instead, she had her passport and cell phone confiscated and was pressured to engage in sex work. Her account describes potential corruption of the immigration office, and problems with trying to reintegrate into her former community."
Sara A.,2016 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,"",United Kingdom (slavery location),"When I left my country in 2002 I was very happy. That is the first time I'm traveling to the —to the place by plane, I was very surprised, I was happy, you know. When I go there I will come here after, like two or three weeks, I come to know, like, I never expected this kind of a job.  You know, I wake up around like 6:30 so when the kids wake up, so I have to wake up with them at what time they sleep, around like 12 or 11 or 11:30. We don't have any schedule, like, time, like you have to start like six o'clock and finish like eight o’ clock though we are working like 24 hours because even the kids will sleep with us in the nighttime so, you know, sometimes if they wake up even we have to wake up. It's that kind of - it is not a fixed time, it's not flexible, no. So we don't have any day off, no, we don't have any freedom like we are like in the cage. It is not our decision to change the employer or here we have the rights we can't change if we don't want to work with them, we can't change day off, we cannot go outside, they don't allow to keep the mobile [phone], we cannot talk, so all this rules we have to follow so we we don't have any chance to, ""okay I can leave this employer and we can jump to another employer"" - no, we don't have any rights like that. The employers are the one who hold the passport with them, not us, no - just when we get down from the airport they are the one we have to hand over all our documents to, so when we travel then they will give the passport to you so, okay, you can get inside. They will come to the airport and they will hand over your passport and wait and go and come back so that's it, no, later only when I come here I know that they shouldn't hold a passport but it's for us. When I enter into UK they said, ""oh here the police are not good, the men are not good,"" you know, just to brainwash us. They said, ""oh here they are like these bad people are here,” you know, there they declare the salary is different in front of the embassy. So they're paying ok, for a week they are paying so much of money. When I come here, it's entirely it's different when I come here. I don't have a separate room for me to stay in, I have to stay with the kids. They never paid me my salary like five and a half months. I stayed with them five and a half months, when I asked them, ""ok, I have to send the money because my family is waiting. If I send the money only they are going to have the food so if you keep their money with you like five and a half months I can't.” They said, ""you cannot send this money to your country,"" I said ""why?"" That time I decided okay I want to leave them, then I want to be free from them. So then I come out. It's very hard, like, I had only a six-month visa, it's almost like 10 or 15 days my visa should be expired, so I come out I only had only 10 days left, so you know it is very difficult. I cannot find the employer, my visa will be gone after 6 months, I have to leave the country and go, it's very hard. So that time I decided, ""okay within this 10 days I can do it."" So I come out so I found the jobs. Because I was happy, I never expected so much of money per week like, Monday to Friday, the employer is very, very good, so I was thinking ""oh my god"" after like six and a half years I got the freedom when I come outside, so I said ""okay, this is - now I am free."" I was so happy.","Like hundreds of others, Sara came to the UK to work for a wealthy family as a domestic worker. Instead she found herself trapped in the nightmare of domestic slavery. Hundreds of domestic workers from overseas find themselves in the UK working for employers that abuse them, afford them little or no pay and often lock them in the very homes they are working in. Currently, UK law stops migrant domestic workers from leaving these employers. The tied visa system in the UK means they have to remain with the employer they arrived with."
Sara,2013 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,India (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I am Sara from India. I lived with my elderly parents and had to provide for them. I moved to Kuwait to be a domestic worker for a wealthy family. I managed to save some money and send it to my parents. The Kuwaiti family was moving to the UK. They invited me to go with them and promised me better pay. When we arrived my world turned upside down. My employers took my passport, made me responsible for their baby 24 hours a day. I was locked in the flat and not allowed out, not even to church. I received no pay. I knew nobody. The next door flat heard from the porter about my employer’s treatment of me and helped me to escape. I found support from Kalayaan. Now I have found a new job. I am a nanny for a good family and live legally in the UK.","The UK government implemented provisions of the Modern Slavery Act allowing foreign domestic workers who are trafficking victims to change employers during the six-month period for which they are admitted. Effective April 2016, any domestic worker determined to be a victim is allowed to remain in the UK for an additional two years. All domestic workers entering on an employment visa into the UK for more than 42 days must attend a session to inform them of their rights and available protections, although observers still argue that this system of “tied” visa status to actual employment continued to leave workers vulnerable, as it discouraged victims from reporting abuses. Sara was kept as a domestic slave by a wealthy Kuwaiti family in the UK, and was only able to escape because the porter of the building and the family’s neighbours noticed the situation and helped her to leave."
Seema A.,2015 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,"",Kuwait (slavery location),"The open border with India is just 10 minutes from my house. This same route has no check post, so traffickers have trafficked many women. I too was tricked and trafficked from this point. I went to Kuwait for foreign employment because my family's financial situation was bad. I'd seen a lot of women in my village go abroad. I thought I could earn enough money and do something with it. I worked as a domestic helper and did household chores for more than two years.  Usually women who come back after working abroad recieve no support from their families and society looks down on them. I joined Shakti to get training and develop some skills, so I can live in my family and society with dignity. We've been doing home visits to inform women going abroad. We tell them to use government-registered manpower agencies. When women are going abroad, we check to see if they are being trafficked. Last year we found five women being trafficked at the border and referred them to authorities for help. I want to continue my work with the aim to free people from human trafficking and slavery. I hope that in the future, no man or woman suffers from trafficking or slavery.","Men and women migrate from South and Southeast Asia, Egypt, the Middle East, and increasingly throughout Africa to work in Kuwait, predominantly in the domestic service, construction, hospitality, and sanitation sectors. Several labor-sending countries, including India, Nepal, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh, restrict their female nationals from domestic employment in Kuwait. The vast majority of migrant workers arrive voluntarily; however, upon arrival some sponsors subject migrants to forced labor, including through non-payment of wages, protracted working hours without rest, deprivation of food, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and restrictions on movement, such as confinement to the workplace and the withholding of passports. Many of the migrant workers arriving in Kuwait have paid exorbitant fees to labor recruiters in their home countries or are coerced into paying labor broker fees in Kuwait which, according to Kuwaiti law, should be paid by the employer—a practice making workers highly vulnerable to forced labor, including debt bondage. In Nepal, poverty forces people to seek work overseas to provide for themselves and their desperate families. Migration across the border is unsafe and uncontrolled, which is how Seema was trafficked and forced into slavery."
Shamere,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Looking back at the 18 months of my victimization by a “guerilla pimp” (most abusive type of pimp), I have to make an honest decision in regard to my actions.  While under the direction of the pimp, I did commit punishable offenses under the law and was charged with conspiracy to commit the Mann Act—driving minors across state lines for illegal purposes. I honestly do not believe that I was a perpetrator of this crime because I was forced to drive the car, just as I was forced to submit to prostitution and the humiliation of being sold for sex, over and over. Congress stated in the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, and I believe, that I should not be held responsible for the crimes I was forced to commit while I was enslaved.  In my case, I believe two key circumstances state the case for my innocence:  1. Motivation: The crimes were committed out of force and in protection of my life and the lives of my family. I never once profited. 2. Free will: I would not have committed these crimes from my own free will—the crimes were committed under the direction of the pimp. A victim does not become the “bottom girl” overnight. It is important to recognize that a “bottom girl” has been deeply manipulated and has likely developed a trauma bond with her pimp. Her basic ability to determine right from wrong has become corrupted by thoughts and actions instilled by her pimp through fear. The “bottom girl” develops compliant behavior after constant threats and real severe beatings and rapes, and witnessing the cruelty done to other girls. From the very first beating when I was choked to the point of unconsciousness until the day he pulled the trigger on the miraculously unloaded gun in my mouth, I knew obedience meant survival. When he placed the gun in my mouth and asked me if I wanted to die, I shrugged. I thought, “Finally, this pain and this life would be over and the only one hurt is the one who was responsible for me being in the situation – ME!” The trigger was pulled but I was still alive.  For a few moments, I thought I was experiencing death with the ability to still see life, until I felt the blows to my head by the gun. This was when I realized there was no hope. I had to continue this life of being obedient to him so my family wouldn’t get hurt, as he reminded me each day.  I was alive, but was not living. I was a slave. Congress expressed its understanding of this victim behavior in the federal TVPA: “Victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked…”  Nonetheless, victims are still being charged. Today in America, the justice system faces a severe challenge. Does it respond to the victimization of the bottom girl by offering services and freedom? Or does it consider the bottom girl a perpetrator and respond with jail sentences and correctional programs? It is a difficult question and the answer is likely unsatisfying: every case is different and should be investigated independently so as to bring justice in the greatest way possible.  My experience revealed the importance of awareness at all levels. Judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys need to be adequately trained on the issue of sex trafficking to be able to evaluate each case and to fully understand the circumstances under which the crimes were committed.  One promising practice is found in the state of Georgia where an expert witness panel was formed to provide informed testimony for the court, improving the likelihood of better outcomes for those “bottom girls” who are charged with conspiring, aiding or committing human trafficking as a result of trying to survive their enslavement, like I was.  As one who has experienced the consequences of this dilemma, it is especially difficult to say that there are circumstances in which the “bottom girl” may actually have stepped over the slippery line of victimization into the role of offender. In any case, age should never be a determining factor in the decision to charge a victim. The simple argument that a victim over the age of 18 should know better does not realistically consider the very real duress experienced by the trafficking victim. But how do we determine when the “bottom girl” is acquitted or convicted? What could I have said in my defense that would have changed the outcome of my conviction? What will we hear in the story of a “bottom girl?”","In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex slavery included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Particularly vulnerable populations in the United States include: children in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems; runaway and homeless youth; unaccompanied children; American Indians and Alaska Natives; migrant laborers, including undocumented workers and participants in visa programs for temporary workers; foreign national domestic workers in diplomatic households; persons with limited English proficiency; persons with low literacy; persons with disabilities; and LGBTI individuals. NGOs have noted a recent increase in cases of street gangs engaging in human trafficking. Shamere here discusses some of the legal complications experienced by slavery survivors who were forced to recruit or otherwise take part in the illegal business that enslaved them. She argues that there are no easy answers as to whether a survivor is also a perpetrator and should be sentenced accordingly: “every case is different.”"
Shandra (Narrative 2),2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United States (slavery location),"It is good to be here today with all of you in this room. I am going to talk about how easy it is lured to human trafficking victim into the United States and what the US government can do to stop it. In my native Indonesia, I was a college graduated, financial analyst in international bank and I lost my job in 1998 because of political turmoils and its fallout and I expanded my job search to United States. After responding an advertisement for one job in hotel in Chicago, I checked the legal document, paid the recruitment fee, and I flew to New York City. I enter the United State with lawfully non-immigrant visa against through the recruitment agency that brought me here. I was picked up at JFK by a man that affiliated with my trafficker and shortly thereafter however, our passport, forcefully removed and we were threatened and we realized that we were trafficked into sex slave. I managed to escape from the small bathroom window by jumping out and I was saved. I cooperate with law enforcement to prosecute my trafficker and Safe Horizon New York assisted me to be independent and stay legally in United State. What I want you to know is a stronger regulation of foreign labor recruiter would have prevented my nightmare in the first place and would save thousands more from similar fate. Labor recruiter and contractors are directly involved in the trafficking and exploitation of workers in United States who enter the country lawfully.  They make false promise about American job and charge workers with highly recruitment fee and false workers to stay in abusive or exploited worker condition under debt bondage. I know several trafficking survivor who paid up to US$20,000 fees for the job that didn’t exist. In most cases, they borrow the money from people, bank or loan shark in their home country. They expect to be paid back. Now, exploited, trafficked, and unpaid. They cannot pay back this loan and this created debt bondage. Congress has an opportunity help prevent this kind of abuse. The Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination for the Act of 2013 or called H.R. 3344 will deter human trafficking, force labor, and exploitation by number one, requiring the workers coming to United State receive the accurate information about the job, visa, and working condition. Number two, ensuring that no recruitment fees charge to the workers. Number three, requiring that recruitment agency registers with the Department of Labor. And the last, number four, enforcing the penalty if the law is not followed by recruitment agencies. I encounter men, women from all over world who have experienced human trafficking in some form, they are from different nations, cultures, backgrounds, but many have one thing in common. They were brought to this country by a seemingly reputable recruiting agency. With an estimate 14,000 individuals trafficked to this country each year and it’s problem that it needs to be addressed. ","In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Shandra was lured to the United States with the promise of legal work in a hotel, but when she arrived she was imprisoned for sexual exploitation. She escaped and worked with the police to prosecute the trafficker. She is now an advocate for slavery survivors. Here she argues that stronger regulation of foreign recruiters is needed to prevent situations of exploitation and enslavement."
Skyra,2015 (Narrative date),Forced labour Sexual exploitation,Mauritania (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Mauritania (slavery location),"We had no choice, as we were born to slave parents, we were slaves through them. For a long time they made us believe that we were created to live as slaves. That was the religion.  My family and I lived like animals, because they used us like objects ... The members of the master’s family did whatever they wanted with us. They made us have sexual relations with them however they wanted; when we resisted, we were beaten and tied up.  We truly believed it was the will of Allah and his prophet Muhammad. You can’t oppose religion. But, when our parents died, my brother started to doubt, because the ill-treatment we suffered was not in the Koran. During our enslavement, we were mistreated, we girls were raped every day. We had no choice, we were powerless before our master. The slightest resistance was punished severely, and that traumatized us. You start to accept the situation as it is... For women it is more complicated [than for Haratine men] because naturally women are more weak and vulnerable. Men have more endurance, they take more of the physical strain, but women also undergo psychological strain on top of the physical. Like when they made me have sexual relations against my will, and I couldn’t say no... I was like his property.You see that little boy there? He is the son of my old master. In fact, most of us women who were slaves, we have done that, either for the master, or for his brothers, or sometimes for his children, when they fancied a bit of fun.","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives. People in slavery come from the Haratine ethnic group, historically enslaved by White Moors. They can be bought and sold, or given as gifts, and face a lifetime of exploitation and abuse. Rape of female slaves is common and their children also become slaves. They are Muslims, and many believe that it is Allah’s wish for them to be enslaved because they are told that their paradise is bound to their Master. In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem. 
Skyra describes the sexual abuse she and others endured from the family that had kept her as a slave since birth."
Sofia,2008 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Europe (slavery location),"My boyfriend sent me to [an EU country] to make money as a prostitute. So one day, together with another girl, we travelled by plane with a false passport to [the EU country]. At the train station [in the capital] some guys were waiting for us. They took us to another city. There, I started working as a prostitute, I had to make money: I owed my boyfriend 3,500 of our local currency because he paid my journey. And I had to make 8,500 Euro in order to help him to buy drugs. After I made 12,000 Euro, he came to meet me and together we travelled to another country. He was a drug dealer and I helped him. One night, when I was out to have a drink by myself, a group of four guys from my country who were trafficking drugs, kidnapped me. They had beaten and threatened me. They had drugs and weapons inside the car. They said to me: “you will work for us”. At the beginning I begged and stole from shops. Afterwards, the trafficker put me out to make money in the street [commercial sexual exploitation] because I couldn’t steal any longer because the entire police knew me. Because I made only small amounts of money the trafficker sold me to another trafficker. I began to know [the city]. I was repeatedly picked up by the police and learned how to get myself out of jail. I learned [the language] and I learned who the trafficker’s friends were, who to beware of, and my network of steady clients expanded. After all this, I managed to escape. I found a ‘sponsor’ [a married man who paid for her hotel] and started on my own.... There were better periods and worse periods, arguments and fights with the girls on the street. For various periods I had to work for other traffickers because they were threatening me. I had no papers. I was countless times picked up by the police for theft or for lack of documents. I was kidnapped by a network of traffickers who drugged me, raped me and locked me up, from where I managed to escape following a police intervention in force. I gave lots of statements, lots that I don’t know how many and I helped in the arrest of this network. [After about one year] Since the traffickers had their eye on me again – they had heard that I was making more than 500 Euro a night and they wanted me back – I left everything I had made in the hotel in [the city] ... and I left with my best girlfriends [both over 20 years old] to another Western country.","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation.

It is a country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and for women and children subjected to sex trafficking, both in Myanmar and abroad. It is also increasingly a destination and transit country for foreign victims, including women and girls from India. Some Burmese men, women, and children who migrate for work abroad—particularly to Thailand and China, as well as other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and the United States—are subjected to forced labor or sex trafficking. Men are subjected to forced labor abroad in fishing, manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, and construction, while women and girls are primarily subjected to sex trafficking, domestic servitude, or forced labor in garment manufacturingAfter four and a half months of training, Su Thet Htoo was sent to work as a guard on the frontline in Karen state, where there have long been insurgents. He was finally freed after campaigning by his mother. The Burmese Army agreed to stop using child soldiers in 2012, but there are signs that this has not stopped completely, and armed ethnic groups still recruit both men and boys through intimidation, coercion, threats, and violence. In addition to formally recruiting at least two children into its ranks in 2016, the military may have continued to use children for labor or other support roles. Some ethnic armed groups abduct or recruit children—including from internally displaced persons’ camps—for use as soldiers in fighting against the Burmese army."
Tatinatt,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",Niger (slavery location),"I used to collect wood and fetch water for my masters daily, with no compensation or respite. I was never treated like a human being, but instead I was treated like a machine, or a donkey that had to be beaten to make it work harder. Beatings and verbal abuse were routine for me. I wasn’t allowed to have belongings or even inherit anything from my parents when they died. One day I came across Timidria (Anti-Slavery partners in Niger). They explained to me that my situation of slavery was a crime, and that it was not endorsed by Islam, as I had always been told. I had always been led to believe that ‘God would punish any slave who disobeyed her master, and that the slave’s chances of going to paradise would be decided by her master. When Timidria told me that she was a human being with the same rights as my masters, I decided to leave my masters, along with several of my relatives. We had no belongings and no money. But we would have preferred to die of hunger than continue to live in slavery.  We soon settled in the new village of Inazgar, [established for communities emerging from slavery] and gradually, the idea of a school project was born. For us, the support from Timidria and Anti-Slavery has changed our lives. Our children are being educated and we are receiving help to start making a living. I never believed that a woman, especially a slave woman, could make her own fortune. But now I have 10 goats and I sell sugar, tea, tobacco, cooking oil and sauces. I even have an ambition: to buy a cow for milking to have enough milk for all my children. I feel completely free – I am no longer a slave. At first, I enrolled my children at school in order to get the grant. I didn’t know anything about the benefits of school. But now my younger children have learned to read and write, which my older children never had the chance to do. They come home and tell us all kinds of things about hygiene. I wish all my children could have gone to school.","Caste-based slavery practices continue primarily in the northern part of the country and affect some 44,000 people. Nigerien boys are subjected to forced labor, including forced begging, within the country and in Mali and Nigeria by corrupt marabouts. Corrupt ‘marabouts’ or loosely organized clandestine networks may also place Nigerien girls into domestic servitude or commercial sex. Tatinatt was born and grew up in slavery.

I had to send them that in addition to the gifts I would take to Romania. I couldn’t accept it. I couldn’t believe this was happening to me. I disgusted myself because I couldn’t believe I was doing this. I couldn’t recognize myself. I was a different woman from before. I wanted to get out, but couldn’t find a way.

Timea,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Debt bondage,Canada (slavery location),"I was 20 years old when my brother and I lived in one apartment in Hungary Budapest, and I had a production company and my brother and I and the production company fell back financially, big time. We started to look for an opportunity where we can make [a lot of] money in [a short] period of time.  [The trafficker] talks about possible babysitting, clean toilets, attending to families, talked about go-go dancing, which is in a nightclub, which is okay in Hungary, it's not a big deal. We were very desperate for money so she said, ""we can buy your ticket just give me your emergency information: mom, dad, everything, name of your cat, address,"" like they're really concerned about you, right? So I just gave them all the information and next thing you know I was on the flight in two weeks to Canada. I was picked up by two Hungarian guys and a Canadian man at the airport they take me to a motel. They said, you know, it cost them so much money to fly me to Canada so now I owe them about $3500. They said ""we'll show you how to make money. We'll take you where the other girls are and you're gonna be able to make so much more money. They did take me to a club which was five minutes away from the motel and that was a strip joint. They told me to go with this Canadian guy and there's some paperwork I have to do in the office. There was no paperwork. This man was about 42 years old and at the time I was 20, he's doing really bad stuff to my body that I've never experienced. The only thing that you feel is that shame and that fear. Every single thing that they tell you all day, every day, eventually you are even scared of your own shadow: ""do not leave the motel"" ""do not leave the club"" ""don't talk to anybody"" constantly they putting in your brain what happened to girls that went to the police. What happened to a girl who would just leave the motel and don't come back. So we worked with 17, 18 hours a day and at the end of the day, which is 6 a.m., they would come to your room and take your money and I used to get, like, an egg salad sandwich once a day, that's what I ate, so that's how we lived, we lived in the motel, we worked, we slept maybe four hours in the morning sometimes we would have guys coming into our motel room and just help themselves with our bodies. Eventually you lose your mind and then you become a zombie and then you just do it because everyone else does it, nobody died from it, and you still don't understand what you've been through, you still don't understand that you are trafficked and trapped. I did feel trapped because I remember I would sit in the window at the motel and I would look at other people how they are free to move around, right? Can I just do that one day? I didn't even realize it then that something is so wrong here. Towards the end I did so eventually I got to the point when I said ""do you know what? I need to get out of here."" I got a hold of a Hungarian dictionary and through the dictionary I was trying to communicate with a couple of staff members in the club that I actually felt comfortable with. I had no idea how to say it so I would be like ""threat,"" ""fake,"" ""passport,"" ""me,"" ""scared,"" ""help,"" so they would put the story together as much as they could. We figured out a plan - the manager, a couple of other people helped me to get my stuff and they put me in a limo-cab and they paid the driver and this was the first time after two and a half months being in Canada that I actually left the club and not getting yelled at. We were driving out of the city, I don't know where I am, it's just so beautiful. I saw a newspaper - it was another girl's story identical to mine - and at the end the detective says in the story ""if there's any other girls out there please contact us."" It was very scary but when I walked to the station and he greeted me was the first time that I felt like a human being in a long time. I didn't tell him everything but I gave him as much as I could do at the time. I tried to do a lot of other things in my life and nothing really made sense. And then I started volunteering and the more I helped people the more I realize that this is what I really want to do. I would never change what happened because of what I do today. I'm okay knowing that I go and give them a chance that I never had because it heals me too, it's fine - it works for me, it works for them - everybody wins.","There are an estimated 17,000 people living in conditions of slavery in Canada (GSI 2018).

Trisha,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Canada (trafficked from),Canada (slavery location),"I grew up in a middle class subdivision in Western Canada, the oldest of 3 kids to parents who had a very tumultuous relationship that involved many visits by the police. My parents finally separated when I was around 11, and my mother was plunged into poverty. With no help to process my life I acted out through drugs, smoking, alcohol, and anger, lots of anger. That erratic behavior was more than my mom could handle and a safety risk to my siblings, so I was placed into government care just before my 13th birthday. And I—like so many other kids in government care—fell prey to the predators that hover around group homes, foster homes, and anywhere vulnerable kids congregate. In all honesty I don’t remember my entry into the sex industry. Obviously I had a first time but I have no actual recollection of it. It just seemed to happen slowly over time. I don’t know if it is my memory trying to save me from myself or if I was high. I know it was with an older man—I think he was in his 30s or 40s and I was around 13. I can see him and his long blonde hair in my mind but I don’t remember what was said or how it played out.  An average day was what I thought was a party. High and drinking all the time. Not realizing the damage I was doing to myself, my loved ones, and later on, my kids. I was always trying to hide what I was doing from many people, saying I worked in a bar or a cocktail lounge, but I would find out later I failed miserably at keeping it a secret. Those years are a haze, they are a blur. I have to say a normal day was just something I was merely trying to survive. Every day was “unnormal” in what I was doing, but when you are a part of that lifestyle it is what everyone is doing so it starts to become “normal.” The violence becomes normal, the derogatory names men call you become normal, the feelings of self loathing and such become normal…which is why I guess the drinking, drugs and dysfunctional relationships became normal.  It’s hard to describe the exploitation—it was just everywhere, it was just a part of life. Girls would come to the corner I was working beat up or looking downcast because they had been emotionally abused by their pimp. There was this girl who tried working my corner, we got into a huge fight, and then I realized how young she was. I tried to protect her; she was supposed to be in a foster home, but she was being pimped out. Then one day, she just disappeared. I saw her pimp a few weeks later and asked him where she was. He just laughed and said, “She’s gone. I sold her at a truck stop.” At this time, we didn’t have the language of trafficking or an understanding of exploitation. There weren’t brothel owners, there were men or women who ran hotel rooms or apartments. There weren’t pimps, there were “boyfriends” or brothers—seemingly someone who cared about you. Later on, I realized that in the industry, unless you were currently being prostituted, you were an exploiter, that’s just how it was. If you were making money off of someone else’s exploitation you were an exploiter. So many people today have this image of a trafficking victim tied up in a room or black and blue with bruises—they don’t understand that many of the girls and women being trafficked are in love with their traffickers or pimps, and that these exploiters use subtle coercion, not just outright violence. The relationships are multi layered, complex; remember most exploiters have been at this for years and they know the best way to control a prostituted woman is through mental and emotional manipulation. The upside for them is this doesn’t leave bruises. I knew a pimp who actually went to community college to take psychology to control his girls; he just saw it as an investment of his time. I was involved in the sex industry for 15 years, from age 13 to 28. I am now out and have been for about 13 years. I was able to leave because of a relationship I formed with an outreach worker. She broke all the rules and we actually became friends, and through that friendship which continues to this day, she showed me a lifestyle that was completely different than mine. Something that in time I decided I wanted for my kids and for myself. I think I would’ve been able to exit earlier if there were agencies that could be accessed more anonymously. I was extremely private and was embarrassed to walk into agencies where everyone knew what they did there. Since I thought I was keeping my working from friends and loved ones, I didn’t want to do “groups,” but I did want help. I was successful in leaving because of my friend, the outreach worker who was willing to meet me where I was, on my terms. It is my understanding that now there are agencies that operate like this—we should be replicating this and offering women a viable way out to a healthier life. It would have also been highly useful to have a livable welfare rate so that I and many, many others wouldn’t have had to work in prostitution in the first place. Knowing I would be able to provide for my kids even if I quit prostitution like I wanted to would have made all the difference. As of right now I have my GED [General Education Development] with no “formal” work experience. I would like to go back to school, maybe get a communications degree. I will continue to work towards the abolition of prostitution. To stop sex trafficking and prostitution, I think going after the root of the problem is the biggest help and the root is the male demand for paid sexual access to women and children’s bodies. We need to stop viewing prostituted persons as part of the problem. They are out there for a myriad of reasons and they need help and support not condemnation and judgment, which is why we should be working to decriminalize the sold and criminalize the demand. This is the best chance for women to get out of prostitution and to hold the right people accountable for their actions. In the long run it will actually work towards the actual END of prostitution. The buyers need to be stopped. Male orgasm should no longer be allowed to dictate women’s oppression and that is exactly what it is currently doing. The male demand keeps the whole cycle going and they need to be held accountable for the abuse they are perpetrating. They should face legal consequences for using their power and money to take advantage of women and girls’ desperation. If we decriminalize prostitution we’d be saying it’s open season on our women especially our marginalized and vulnerable, when it’s them we should be protecting the most. We would be standing in agreement with the eroticization of poverty, the ignoring of mental health issues, colonization, addiction, and racism—instead of dealing with them we will be offering them up to men’s sexual demands and saying that this is acceptable. We would be saying that this is sexy and let’s take advantage of it. The marginalized and vulnerable would be more marginalized and vulnerable because no one would be helping them or looking out for them. And men would be on their worst behavior; because everyone would be saying what you’re doing is ok. Violence will increase. Sweden decriminalized the prostituted and criminalized the demand. At the beginning it will be a very hard transition, but Sweden seems to have done it and I think Canada can also be a country that is working to see the end of prostitution.  ","Trisha became more vocal in speaking out about the abuses of the sex industry after writing about the 2006-2007 murder trial of convicted serial killer Robert Pickton—most of whose victims were women in prostitution and many of whom were known to Trisha. In 2009 she founded EVE (formerly Exploited Voices now Educating), a volunteer, non-governmental, non-profit organization composed of former sex-industry women dedicated to abolishing prostitution as a form of violence against women. She is a leading activist in the campaign calling on the Canadian government to reform its prostitution laws so that women in prostitution are decriminalized and provided with much-needed services, while sex buyers, pimps and brothel owners are criminalized."

They told me if I ran away they would find and kill me, would come to my village and kill my mother.... Then he sold me to a woman. They took us by maxi taxi to the place where we were sold. We were sold to the clients, three to four girls per night. A woman took the money. We were always supervised. We were beaten for any little thing. We ate only pasta. Several girls ran away, the trafficker caught them and beat them hard in front of us. They told us that the same will happen to us if we run away.  During my time there, the owner of the bar and a friend of his used me and one day the owner had to leave because his son was sick, so he left me with his friend, who sexually used me and when I would refuse or I would try to get out they would keep me locked in the basement.  They threatened me saying that there was nothing I could do, that everybody had seen me with them and nobody would believe me, that they would set fire to my house, that they would kill my mother and my child, that they would rape my sisters.

People are helpless because they have no skills or education. There’s nobody there to guide them to fight against the slaveholders.

That is the spirit I have inside me.","According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, over 2 millions people in Pakistan live in slavery. One of the most prevalent forms of slavery here is bonded labor, in which an initial debt assumed by a worker as part of the terms of employment is exploited, ultimately entrapping other family members, sometimes for generations. Bonded labor is concentrated in Sindh and Punjab provinces, but also occurs in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, in agriculture and brick-making and, to a lesser extent, in fisheries, mining, and handicraft- and carpet-making. Some feudal landlords and brick kiln owners affiliated with political parties use their influence to protect their involvement in bonded labor. Veero’s family took salary advances as migrant farm workers, after which the landowner trapped them by claiming the debt was never repaid. Veero was able to escape her enslavement on foot, a difficult and dangerous journey. Today she works on farms as a freewoman, and helps with the release of other slaves. So far she has helped at least 700 others out of slavery."

In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem."
Bouquet ,2017 (Narrative date),Migration,Libya (trafficked from),Libya (slavery location),"You may have seen the video of black people being sold. But that's too late. You've only seen videos of 2017. What happened to the videos of 2013, 2012, 2014? They're not showing you that. Blacks being sold is hurtful, that's true. But believe me there’s worse than that. If I tell you there is worse than that, that's because I have been sold. I know what Libya is because I made it out of Libya. I spent a lot of time in Libya. I know Libya like the back of my hand. I was sold for $270. In a place called Sabha that many know. I worked for 6 months on a plantation. By God's grace I was able to escape. But it wasn't over. I escaped one hellhole to embrace another worse one. I fled Sabha for Bangali. I was kidnapped by a group of rebels. The rebel leader was Abdul Karim. All who’ve been through Bangali know this man. This man has over 350 African women in captivity at this very moment. The men I can’t even count. The whip was a everyday thing. The electric wire on your body. We were over 1000 people in Abdoul Karim captivity. By God’s grace I escaped alone. In 2016. When I escaped, I couldn’t help my brothers that were still locked up. I can’t complain to anyone because everyone is in the same migrant trade. When NGOs come visit blacks in prisons, they dress you up in Adidas outfits to give the impression that you’re doing well in prison. There’s not one migrant that going to speak or else it’s your death. They come under the pretext of deporting you but they will never deport. They’re a business between NGOs and Libya. It’s a very easy game. The Libyan navy that’s supposed to support you and show you hospitality by deporting you to your respective countries. That same Libyan navy, rescue you at sea and resale you to other rebels that torture you and force your family to send them money. I saw prisons in Libya five times. Why? If you’re caught while crossing the Mediterranean Sea, it’s the beginning of your worst nightmare. You don’t even have enough to eat. You go out to find something, you’re kidnapped. It’s not easy! It’s the only country in the world that every Friday they sell weapons on the sidewalk. Kalashnikovs are sold for less than a dollar. Only in Libya. The young girls. If you see our African sister in Libya. The way that they’re being tortured!? In the prison in raskah, they make the men take off your clothes. They force you to sleep with your own brother! Your friend that you eat together, you have to sleep with him. If you don’t do it my brother, they break your legs with weapons. Our African leaders, you stay quiet with your mouth closed. That little video from CNN that you saw. That is painful, is turning the world upside down. If they show you the actual reality, it can set off a third world war. But we didn’t have phones at that time to film what was happening. There’s worse than selling blacks in Libya. There’s much worse! There’s much much worse than that! When I say much worse, believe me. I experiences Libya from the entrance to the exit. Time is of the essence we don’t even have a second to waste. Libyans have private prisons. Meaning that every Libyan built his own private prison.  He can catch 15 to 20 to 40 migrants depending on how big his house is. Locks you up and forces you to pay. We don’t talk about people who are being kidnapped and held in private prisons. The Libyan state prisons, financed by Europe to stop migration of Africans in Europe. The same people catch migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, are the same people that resell them to rebels and submit them to slavery like you’ve seen. Make them work hard! Many Africans died. When Africans die at sea the corpse wash up on the shore in Souara, the city where I was living. No one is filming this. Here’s a very simple example. When they send 15-20 boats in the Mediterranean Sea, there might be seven boats that make it. What happened to the other boats? They all drowned! One boat hold 120 migrants at one time. Imagine if 15 boats were sent out. And only seven boats make it. Meaning eight boats drown at sea. If you multiply 120 migrants by eight boats it equals a lot of dead blacks. You know how that happens? You’ve never heard of African cemeteries in Libya. You never asked about the corpses of Africans that drowned in the Mediterranean. You’ve never understood the system. We pick up the blacks. It’s thousands of dead corpses. We dig a big hole, we dump the corpses inside the hole. We never cover the hole with dirt. Just to make the Africans believe that they were buried. It’s not done! That’s when the organ trafficking starts. That’s what it’s all about. Organ trafficking! They remove the essential organs before filling the hole. I know what I’m talking about. I’m not talking just to talk. I’m talking about what I experienced. What I saw with my own eyes. They decapitate the African’s bodies. They take the organs they need to sell to the westerners. There are American and French boats on sea. Under the pretext of extracting oil. It’s all business. It’s not oil. When you hear that there are 4 or 25 boats that sank at sea, what do you think happened to the bodies? No one’s talking about that. They’re millions of Africans who died in Libya. Some families think that they’re kids made it to Europe but it’s not so. You can’t even tell the family because you will break their hearts. I’m from Cameroon, I lost a lot of my friends. As I speak right now, many are still in jails. Jails that even African presidents can’t find because they’re underground. You need someone who knows the territory to expose these prisons. I can’t cry anymore, I’m tired of crying. We saw too many corpses. We thank all of you for the huge protests that you did for us today. It’s truly heartfelt. African leaders, if you come, if you don’t come, you’ve already exposed you guilt! But our brothers manifestations gives us hope to escape the hell we are facing. God always has the last word. I thank you.","Libya exists as the main transit point for refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. 150 000 men, women and children make the dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea each year, with 3000 dying while attempting the journey. With authorities trying to regulate this migration, it is estimated that 400,000 to 1 million people are now bottled up in Libya. This has led to detention centres becoming overrun and along with other abuses, migrants find themselves vulnerable to being sold off in slave auctions as labourers, sex workers or to militia groups.
Bouquet was sold to work on a plantation in Sabha. He then found himself kidnapped by rebels led by Abdul Karim, captured and held along with 1000 other people he was subjected to physical abuse daily. Though he was able to escape in 2016, Bouquet details the conditions endured in Libya, he tells of the resale of migrant prisoners to rebels as slaves, and of the trafficking of migrant’s organs who drown on their journey across the Mediterranean.

Afsana,2011 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"The situation I was in, I don’t think anyone should have to go through that. Father used to plough other farmer's fields. He found it difficult to feed a family of eight. She came to my house to convince my parents. “If you let me take her, I will get her a good job. And she will be able to send money home every month. You will have a better life.” She gave my father some money. After that my father agreed to send me. But my mother didn’t agree. Finally my father was able to convince my mother to let me go. Looking back, I think that woman was a child trafficker. Women like her prey on families like mine, and take away girls like me. They promise one thing and then make us do something entirely different. After I left home we crossed some fields and then we came to a river. We crossed the river by boat. We got to a bus stand and then we got on a bus. I was crying on the bus so aunty said “Don’t cry. You will be looked after there.” “Don’t worry, you will be fine. Your parents will also be fine.” I had full confidence that she will get me a good job. When we got to the house a lady opened the door. Then aunty told me I will be staying and working here. She said this and she left me there. I was made to wake up at 5am. They’d make me clean the house, wash clothes and even cook. I never got proper good. If I made a mistake, they would beat me. One day while cleaning the house I broke a glass by accident. The lady of the house heard the sound. And she came running. She saw the smashed glass on the floor. She pulled my hair and started screaming and beating me. “You have broken my glass! You ignorant person! I will throw you out of my house.” Her husband… he would try to hold my hand, pinch my cheeks. And he would even try to touch different parts of my body. But I couldn’t go anywhere. I didn’t even know anyone in that city. She would laugh and tell me “Money? What do you need money for? Your parent don’t love you. They don’t even want you. They have sold you to me. I’m not going to give you any money.” Traffickers worldwide should be caught and punished so that no child or woman can be trafficked again. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit.","It is estimated that there are over four million domestic workers in India. The domestic sector is informal and unregulated, obscured in private homes, and workers are not recognised as such but rather as ‘informal help’. Their wages are, on average, only a third of those in other sectors, they have very limited social protections, and commonly suffer poor working conditions, exploitation, abuse and slavery. Many domestic workers are migrants from poorer states and are among the most marginalised and socially discriminated populations in India. Most of them are Dalits or come from other disadvantaged castes and tribal minorities, many are landless, illiterate and innumerate, which increases their vulnerability and disempowerment. Afsana was just 16 years old and her parents were struggling to feed their family when a woman offered to get Afsana a job. Eventually both parents agreed and Afsana was taken to a house to undertake domestic work. Forced to work long, gruelling hours and physically and sexually abused Afsana never received any money for her work. Afsana eventually escaped with the help of a local worker."
Anna A.,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Macedonia (slavery location) Romania (trafficked from),Serbia  (slavery location),"I was sold when I was 20 and for two and a half years I lived in a nightmare. They said I had to go with them to get the papers as they required my signature. I left my little girl with my sister and said I’d be back in two hours. They took me to a house that looked abandoned. When I went inside the house there were other girls sleeping on the floor. They looked scared. I spent 2 days at that house. Within those 2 days they kept coming to look at us. We were in our underwear so that they could see what we looked like. We were watched by the people that brought us here because they knew that at any time we would attempt to escape. They were armed with knives, they were really evil. They would shout and force us to smile, laugh and look happy. They would bring foreign men to see us every 15 to 30 minutes. The inspected us. After a while it was my turn to go out with a client. When I got to the room he told me to get undressed but I refused. I was scared. I didn’t want to. I wanted to drink, I wanted to die. He shouted that he’d paid for me to do whatever he wanted. I said “I won’t do it!” The owner said that he can do whatever he wants with me as long as he takes me back alive. He took me to the shower and told me to undress. He ripped my clothes off. And then he raped me. One day we heard rumours about a raid so the owner took us to an apartment to hide us. One of my clients had said that in case of a raid he knew where I’d be taken and he would help me escape. I couldn’t believe it. I thought I was dreaming. I’d managed to escape. I want to tell all the girls who want to go abroad to do all the checks before they go. Never trust people who promise they would find them a job, even if they’re friends of family, always check first. When I saw her for the first time I was stunned. I was shaking, I couldn’t believe it. She looked at me. She had a locket. She opened it, looked at the picture and then looked at me again. She called me “Mama” and she started to cry. I didn’t know what to do. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. According to the most recent Eurostat findings, European Union (EU) citizens account for 65 percent of identified trafficked victims within Europe. These individuals mostly originate from Eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia. Within cases formally identified by EU authorities the largest proportion of registered human trafficking victims were female, making up around 80% of all victims. Anna was 20 years old when she was trafficked by neighbours from Romania to the Balkans where she was forced to be a prostitute for two and a half years. Anna was finally able to escape when rumours of a raid meant she, along with the other girls she was enslaved with, had to be moved and one of her clients offered to help."
Anna,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Asia-Pacific (slavery location),"I had just turned seventeen, fresh out of high school. I wanted to go to college but we didn’t have any money. My father didn’t have a job. I met Mary Anne while I was at my aunt’s house, she would always tell me stories about her cousin, how successful she was and how she helped her family by sending money back every month. I kept asking if I would be safe there and she assured me that I would be. She told me I didn’t need to worry because her cousin would take care of me.  So I trusted her. Mary Anne told me that her cousin would take care of my airfare, and I could pay her back when I started working. So I only had to worry about the passport. From the airport we headed to a salon. She had me all made up. Then we went to where we were staying. There were five girls staying there, I was the sixth girl. When I found out that I owed US $50, 000, that’s when I realised I had been sold off. When we got to the man’s door, she rang the doorbell. She said she would wait for me outside. Then the man took me to his room. I was crying and I tried to escape from him, but he was holding me tight.  I couldn’t get him off me. I was a virgin at that time. It was painful, it hurt so bad. I felt scared. I realised that’s how it is, when you are being raped. You feel helpless. I cried over the thought that I would be going through the same thing, every single night. When I discovered I was pregnant, I felt like my whole world fell apart. I cried so hard. I never wanted this to happen to me. This experience will definitely haunt me for the rest of my life. It was like being in hell. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," It is reported that two-thirds of the world's enslaved population are in the Asian-Pacific region. Men, women and children are subjected to all forms of modern slavery including forced labour, domestic servitude, forced begging, commercial sexual exploitation and child soldiers. The high prevalence of modern slavery in the region reflects the reality that many countries in Asia provide low-skilled labour for the production stage of global supply chains. Anna had just left school and was looking for a job when her aunt’s next door neighbour promised her a well-paid job as a waitress overseas. She was told that her airfare would be paid for, however after being taken to where she would be staying, she was told that she owed $50,000 and must work as a prostitute to pay it off.  "
Carla,2011 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,"",Philippines (slavery location),"I left because our life was very difficult. I no longer had a father. I wanted to leave so I could give my siblings a better future. So they could finish school. Even if I may not be able to finish myself, I wanted them to finish school so we could all help my mum. It started when a friend introduced me to their parents. That’s when the mother told me that she could help me find work. Then she took me to the agent’s house. The agency told me that I could have a better future in Manila and I’d be able to send money to my mum. My job was to do the laundry, clean, mop the floors and iron clothes. They took care of me like their own daughter. But as time passed they started beating me. There was no resting. I worked everyday even if I was tired. I couldn’t escape because the whole house was locked. Even my room was locked. When I got sick they wouldn’t take me to the doctor. They hit my head with a hammer, stabbed me with scissors, and a screwdriver. Then I was whipped with a thick electrical cable. They poured hot water on my face. My head bled and my face was swollen. If I escaped I would have been putting my family in danger. They said they’d hold them captive and they’d be my replacement for work. They said I owed them money for water, utilities, food and the airfare. They didn’t pay me my salary. I was screaming and suddenly lost consciousness. But the neighbours heard me, and that’s when they called the guard and told him that something was happening in the house. The police came and rushed into the unit. That’s when they rescued me and took me to the hospital. If you know it’s wrong don’t do it. Just go home. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," It is estimated that of the 400 000 enslaved in the Philippines, the majority are in forced labour. Recent surveys suggest that one in every two Filipino women are working abroad in unskilled and domestic work, some of the highest risk industries for modern slavery. High population growth combined with limited employment opportunities leads many Filipinos to look for work abroad. People are deceived by promises of higher salary and better working conditions, only to find themselves forced to work long hours with no pay under the threat of physical and sexual violence. This forced labour often involves debt bondage in which the enslaved is told they owe money for travel, accommodation and living expenses. Carla left school to find work in order to help support her family. Taken to an agency Carla accepted an offer to become a domestic worker in Manila where she was told she would be able to earn more money. After working in multiple houses for different families, she arrived at a home where initially she thought she would be treated well. However, she soon found herself working every day, locked inside the house, subjected to physical beatings and denied medical attention. Carla was rescued when neighbours heard screaming and called the police. "
Cel,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,South Korea (trafficked from),South Korea (slavery location),"I was in my third year of high school when my father passed away. When he died no one else in the family was working. After his death we faced a lot of challenges. That’s when I started looking for a job. The agent was a guy and he made me sing in a karaoke bar. He made me audition to see if I could sing and really had any talent. They asked us to sign a document in Korean which they said was our contract. I asked, “Why are we signing documents in Korean that we don’t understand?” They said, “Where is it you’re going? Korea, right?” We were intimidated and scared to ask more questions in case it upset them. Next they had us sign a blank piece of paper. They said, “Just sign it because otherwise you won’t be able to leave.” I believed them because I was thinking of my family. To take them out of poverty and to fulfill our dreams. The owner of the agency said we would only get paid after 7 months. I asked, “Why? My family is counting on me. How can I support them?” We were then given another list of debts – according to them PHP30, 000 plus. I asked what it was for, they explained it was to cover the airfare, video recordings and lodging, which we thought was free of charge. That’s what they promised. When I arrived in Korea, in the afternoon we were asked to dress up and then taken to a bar. That’s when it started. We were lined up while drunk Koreans chose girls. We were told to raise our skirts and take our panties off. They would touch us inappropriately and kiss us. They would ask you to sing. If they enjoyed it, they’d hit you so hard you’d fall to the floor. I’d be crying while they stripped off my clothes. I’d be crouching in front of them, exposing my entire body. One time I even saw one of my friends being choked. It hurts so much when we remember the things that were done to us. It’s very painful. We couldn’t stay there any longer. We had to find a way to call our families. We agreed to save money so we could buy a cellphone and call our families. It hurts, especially when I returned to the Philippines, of course people gossiped a lot about me, and it made me feel like a huge failure. They said I’m too ambitious and that’s why this happened to me. The experience in Korea taught me, to think carefully, ask questions and not be too trusting. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," It is estimated that around 204,900 people are living in modern slavery in South Korea today. Acting as a source country for the trafficking of women and children both within the country and abroad to the US, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Many women also find themselves trafficked in to South Korea from Russia, China, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries. Often recruited under the guise of an entertainment visa they finds themselves subject to sexual exploitation or domestic servitude. Sex slavery is prevalent in Korea, with a number of reports citing the exploitation and forced prostitution of women into brothels frequented by US servicemen stationed in the country. There have also been reports of the sexual exploitation of children in Korea, with employers taking advantage of runaway children and youth. With one of the highest numbers of users in the world, the internet has become a popular place for trading sex in Korea. Cel found herself looking for work to support her family after the death of her father. She was approached by an agent who offered her a job singing in a karaoke bar in Korea. After signing a document in a language she didn’t understand, Cel was informed that she wouldn’t be paid for seven months as she had incurred debts for airfare and lodging. Upon arrival in Korea Cel was taken to a nightclub where she was forced to work as a hostess, subjected to sexual exploitation and physical violence by the customers. After saving up money to buy a phone with other girls working at the club, Cel was eventually able to her mother who contacted the authorities. With their intervention Cel was finally reunited with her family.  "
Chaivoeurn,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Cambodia,"When I was a kid, I never went to school because my parents were poor and I had many brothers and sisters. My family’s standard of living was miserably poor. At that time, I didn’t have any knowledge and I was just a young girl, but I wanted to help my parents because they were in debt.  When the due date came, they fell sick and couldn’t earn any money to pay off their debts. My Aunt often came around to my house and told me that she was looking for someone, to work in Phnom Penh because she knew people who had asked her to find a worker for them. The reason why I trusted her was because firstly, I thought she was my Aunt and secondly, my family was so poor. So, I had no option to choose but to go with her. The reason why my Aunt could lure me to Phnom Penh, was because she promised she would find a dishwashing job for me in Phnom Penh. She tried several times to persuade me because when she first approached me, I was not convinced and didn’t really trust her. But after speaking to me again and again, I finally decided to go. It took her four or five times to convince me. When I arrived in Phnom Penh, my Aunt took me to a woman’s house with whom she told me she was close to. After she dropped me at her house, she told me to wait for a moment in the house while she would do out to buy me something to eat.  After she left, I just kept waiting for her to return, long into the night. Then I asked the house owner where she had gone. The house owner told me that she had already gone back. I had no ideas what they were doing in the house because it was quiet. But in the basement there were rooms, which were locked. She was trying to persuade me to work for her. I asked her what job and she said working in Karaoke parlours and sleeping with clients. No matter how much I cried and begged her, she didn’t let me go.  At that point, I felt terribly scared and thought it was the end of my life. When they tried to force me to sleep with clients, I resisted. They did not give me any food to eat or even water to drink. They locked me up in the basement room and it was completely dark. She threatened me and electrocuted me and when I could no longer endure the suffering and hunger, I agreed to sleep with clients. When I was sleeping with them, they would beat and torment me. When I couldn’t satisfy them, they tormented me. She did not allow me to leave the room and she brought the clients to me. Even if I agreed to sleep with clients, it was just in exchange for my daily meals. They didn’t set me free. They never let me see the sunlight. I was so terrified and nobody could help me, so I had to agree to take drugs in order to sleep with clients. Then I became addicted to the drugs. Then, I only worked hard to get the drugs. I didn’t care about food and water anymore. I slept with clients everyday to earn money for the owner, in exchange for only one of two pills. After I became dependent on the drugs, they forced me to sleep with 20 to 30 clients a day. I could not bear the hardship without the drugs. I did not know what to do. Then I took a razor blade from my friend and cut my arm. I’ve got these scars on my arm because I needed the drugs. When I couldn’t serve her clients well enough, she would beat me. When I refused to sleep with clients, she beat me and when I refused to use drugs, she beat me. The brothel owner told me that they had spent a lot of money to buy me. So, they made me work to pay back the debt. They did not allow me to go back home. No matter how much money I earned for them, it was never enough. When I became worthless, she sold me to another brothel. The reason I was sold to another brothel as because I became too old for the clients at the first place as they only liked young girls. For the period of 8 years when I was working in the brothels, I never received any money. None of the people around me felt pity for me. I finally managed to get out of the brothel because one day, while I was standing with my colleagues, waiting for clients, the police conducted a raid on the brothel. All the others were able to escape and I was the only one left. The police arrested me and referred me to Social Affairs. If I return to my village, my difficulty is, I don’t know how I will face the situation. I really want to tell others about my story but I find it had to do so. I think the villagers will definitely discriminate against me. They don’t know much about my story and they already discriminate me. What would happen if they knew the whole story? This is my main concern. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Cambodia was renowned as a sex tourism destination in the 1990s and this legacy is still prevalent today with women and girls trafficked within the thriving sex industry in Cambodia's major cities. Despite significant attempts to curb CSE, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels. Boys and young men are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation, with many entering the massage industry due to a lack of training and skills. Chaivoeurn travelled to Phnom Penh with her aunt for work to help her parents pay off their debts. Told she would be working for a family, when she arrived Chaivoeurn was locked up, starved and tortured until she agreed to work sleeping with clients. Forced to serve clients every day to pay back debts incurred from her sale, Chaivoeurn worked for 8 years in different brothels. She was only able to escape from bondage after police arrested her during a raid and she was referred to social services."

I trusted that this agency was real because they used the name of a big, well known agency. It seemed like it was an actual agency. He kept trying to get my passport from me, he kept saying this is normal all the other girls do it, and so that was when red lights went off in my head and I have been taught never give anyone your passport. If you’re in a different country you need that. He just came right up to me and erm, I don’t know exactly what it was, but there was something sharp in my bag. The only thing that was running through my mind was erm, if you don’t fight him, you’re not going to get out of this alive. [Chloe managed to push the agent away and locked herself in the bathroom with her phone and his bag] I opened the bag to see what was inside and aside from the machete there was a roll of duct tape, mine as well as three or four other girls’ passport copies. I thought oh this is a big operation it wasn’t just me and God knows how many other girls they’ve already gotten. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Men, women and children make up those trafficked in Indonesia, subjected to forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Brokers working in rural areas are known to lure men and boys into forced labour on palm oil, rubber and tobacco plantations, while women and under-age girls are lured into work as domestics in private homes and as commercial sex workers. Rising unemployment and slowed job creation has pushed people into the informal sector unprotected by labour laws and thus made them more vulnerable to exploitation. There are currently only 18 shelters in Indonesia working to rescue and rehabilitate traffic victims. Chloe was offered work as a model by what she thought was a well-known agency. After arriving in Kuala Lumpur she checked into a hotel arranged by the modelling agency. There she met a recruiter who told her to hand over her passport. When she refused, the recruiter attacked her. Chloe was able to lock herself in the bathroom and call for help. "

After that my husband started to beat me. I didn’t want things to carry on as they had been. At that time, a woman came to my parents’ house. I think my mum must have known her. They spoke together, she invited me to get away from the situation I was in.  I was introduced to a sponsor. The sponsor then introduced me to the agent. They promised to open up a lot of new opportunities for me.  I was promised a better life. There were more than a hundred of us. We had to sleep on the floor without any bedding. We had to sleep on the tiles. There was only one bathroom. We thought “What is this?” we were grown women being forced to bathe like that. We were paying to be there. We were forced to stay outside in the sun and the rain. Within one month I was already well and truly mentally conditioned by them. One morning I was taken to the agency in Singapore. There was an employer waiting for me, I think it was a relative of the agent. I was taken to their home in Yishun. My contract was for US $182 per month, but over the first eight months they deducted US $176 per month. That meant over eight months I was only left w/ US $6 per month. I was always locked inside the house. I would wake up at 5am, and I’d still be cleaning all the way up to 11pm. Everyday the old man would beat me. He always said that he wanted to kill me, that’s what drove me to my breaking point.  I wasn’t that strong, I was really upset from what I had been through.

Erich,2011 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Sexual exploitation,Philippines,"I didn’t have plans to go abroad because I like it here in the Philippines. It was my decision to work because I wanted to save and go back to school. My friends’ aunt was looking for a girl so they came to our house and asked me to work as a babysitter and housecleaner. They said our sleeping area is nice. The house is nice. That we could go home every month with money in hand. My friend’s aunt looked at me and said I was beautiful, and asked me to sit in front of the computer.  We were locked inside a room. The next day as soon as I sat in front of the computer she taught me how to do a ‘show’. There were four computers and eight of us who worked there. We’d take turns every twelve hours. A ‘show’ is when you go naked, show you breasts and private parts. If they wanted you to finger yourself you would do it. I was disgusted and I cried when I did a ‘show’. We didn’t have breaks, it was non-stop. If you left the room she would get angry. Her husband was also inside the house. There was a monitor where he could see if we were doing ‘shows’ or not. I didn’t show her that I was disgusted and that I would cry. She’d just laugh at me and tease me. She’d say, “What is wrong with what you are going? You’re not letting men actually touch you.” I am both excited and reluctant to go home because I am shy and scared that people will laugh and will be disgusted at me. That’s how people are, they gossip a lot.

Gai,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Japan,"I got married and we lived like a normal married couple in the country. Eight years into our marriage when our second child was born, my husband started hanging out with friends and coming home late. He stopped bringing back the salary, so we started having problems. I had a friend from my village who had a Japanese husband. She knew that I was having problems so she said, “My husband is about to open a new branch of his restaurant, and it would be good to have people from the same village help run it.” My mother reassured me by saying that I would be okay because she’s from our village and we’d known each other since I was young. My friend said she would take care of all the visa documents.  [Upon arrival in Japan Gai was taken to a secure apartment] The next morning I woke up around 10am. I was stripped naked and they took photos. So I asked, “What job will I be doing exactly… why would have to do this if I’m going to work in a restaurant?” They laughed. The woman sneered at me and said, “Restaurants? Don’t be stupid, there are no restaurants, every Thai woman here is sold to work in the brothels.” So I said, “I’m not doing this kind of job.” She said, “What do you mean? Do you know how much money you owe?” I said, “I don’t have any debts.” They laughed and said, “Who told you that? You are THB 475,000 in debt. If you don’t work, you won’t see your children again.” On average I would get 6 to 7 clients per day. The clients knew I was there against my will and had to clear my debt. Every time I did something wrong or clients complained, THB 18,000 would be added to my debt. If there was a client they would wake you up. 24 hours a day without rest or a day off, even when I had my period. I had to put a sponge inside me. If the customer knew I had my period, I would get fined. They were in control of me 24/7. I felt like I was in a prison. I contemplated suicide many times. I thought I would die in Japan. [Gai was able to escape with the help of a Thai man who befriended her] I was unsure if he might want to sell me off too. I never thought anyone would come to help, but I was willing to take the risk so I could escape. I decided to do whatever it took. When I saw my kids I hugged them and I was shaking. It’s really hard for a woman to stand up and talk about problems, like what happened to me. People in the village were saying, “You’re mad to talk about yourself! Why embarrass yourself? If you said nothing no one would know.” The fact that I’ve spoken out and taken action can protect hundreds of other women. There are plenty of foundations and organisations that can give you the information and advice. No matter what country you’re going to, you should know where the Thai Embassy is and the phone number, so that when you are in an emergency situation you can seek help.

Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex.

I’m not the kind of person to question people, so afterwards I thought she was cool. I asked her about the ticket and mentioned I was underage. She told me to relax and that the ticket would already be arranged. I didn’t ask her about anything else because I was already tempted by the job. I was immediately picked up by three men.

Then they took me down a hall, and told me exactly what my job was in Batam. I was really upset, so they gave me drugs. My first client tried to unzip my dress but I zipped it again. I refused to serve him. In fact I even asked him to help me. I asked him to set me free, and told him that this wasn’t my real job. The client told my agent. My agent walked into the room and hit me. I had no choice but to serve him. In the nights that followed, I had to serve 3 men each night. I was so sad, I started to cry. When I cried, the clients didn’t help me at all, but instead, they reported me to my agent. They didn’t feed me, or give me any salary. I was abused, kicked, hit, and they treated me inhumanely.

My desire was to be able to support my family. After we drove around Dumai we stopped at a counter, and I was put in a room. Not long after, a man walked in and said he was an officer. He said “I’m a local soldier, whoever wants to go home can leave, but you will have to pay 2 million rupiah per person.” No one wanted to pay. Afterwards, the officer walked in again and said, “Whoever wants to work, I will help you find a job.” He said, “Don’t ask too much about it, just take whatever you can get.” After that we were taken to our working place, into the forest, Bening forest. We were sold for 500,000 rupiah per head. The recruiter looked like an honest person but his heart was not. I asked him about my daily salary. He told me to shut up or he would stab me. The boss ordered us to go into the woods, to pull all the logs out of the woods and lay them near the river. As humans we did the work of buffaloes. After we had worked there for some time we realised, that we could end up dead there. If anybody made a mistake, the thug would be called in to kill them.  He often drowned men in the river by putting them inside sacks. We didn’t earn anything. The boss was the only one who benefitted. We didn’t know whether the runaways were alive or dead, but their debts were still counted. As long as we were there, the boss wanted us to pay off their debts too. When we managed to escape, I felt so happy. I was really relieved to be free of that logging job.

Jose,2012 (Narrative date),Children,Mexico (trafficked from),Mexico (slavery location),"My mom’s job was sleeping with men for money. All my mom could do was rent a room for us. We didn’t have a bed or a table there. We’d sleep on the floor with some blankets. When my mom would come back, if there was anything wrong, if the house wasn’t clean or if my brothers were crying, I was the oldest, so she would come back and hit me. She’d hit me with whatever she found, with pipes, cables… She’d kick me. It got to a point where I was really scared. She sent me to the market and it got really late, so I didn’t want to go back. And at that time I had just turned eight. We’re at the Huixtla city station. It’s a train station. And this is where I used to sleep at night, just like them, on cardboard boxes. And under that roof there, that’s where I used to sleep.  This kid came along, who was shining shoes. I was sleeping and he woke me up. Then I went with him because he said he’d give me food and that I could stay at his house. When I got to the house, the father of the kids said: “We all live here, but we have to work to earn our food. So if you’re going to live with us you have to go out and work. Here’s a shoe-shining kit. You have to go out and work. You’re going to bring me $50,00 a day.” We had to give him the money, otherwise he’d hit us too. But if we gave it to him, he’d go out and drink and he wouldn’t leave any money for us to eat. We didn’t care if we didn’t get the money, or if we had to sleep on the street. We cared more about buying our drugs. Some people came and asked us: “You want money for your drugs? Do you want money? We can give you money but you have to do what we say.” They’d give me some packages. It could be marihuana… or crack or whatever, but I couldn’t open them. They’d give me the packages and I’d have to carry them. By that time I was going on ten, and we never talked about how much money they’d give me. They just said “We’ll pay you some money.” At night, they’d get in the truck and put me in the back, and they’d say “That guy over there owes us money. So you go over there and tell him to come out.” When the guy came out, they’d take him and put him in the truck. And they told me “That’s what you’re going to be doing later. So you have to watch what we do.” And they’d hold me in front of them so I’d watch them hitting him, and beating him up, making him bleed and hurting him. After some time, I was scared they’d beat me up like that too, so I escaped. Once... I was really high and a woman looked at me. I went up to her and asked her for money. And she said she wouldn’t give me money because I’d buy more drugs. She told me about a home, but that sounded to me like being in jail, being locked up, not doing what I wanted to do. But I went to sleep at her house. And the next day she said “I want to take you to a home. I want you to get better.” I finally told her “OK, fine,” so she’s stop nagging me. I was used to doing whatever I wanted to do. I was used to not sleeping at night, walking around, doing drugs. When I got to the home, I couldn’t do any of that anymore. The first time I ran away, it was because they left the door open. She went out to look for me. She found me, and when she did, she started crying in front of me. When she cried in front of me, I felt something completely new. She said she loved me. No one had ever cried for me. No one had ever said they loved me, that they had faith in me and that I could do something better. Since then… my life has changed completely. After all I’ve been through, when I’m at the beach, I feel free. When you ride the waves you can laugh, scream… and let off steam. To me, the sea has healing power. It’s helped me heal. It’s helped me feel free and good about myself. I know that there are lots of kids out there who are going through the same thing I went through, or worse.

She came to our house several times to tell my mother and I this. She said she could guarantee a way for me to get to Malaysia. The monthly salary was supposed to be 700 MYR equal to 3.5 million VND. If I did a good job, they would raise the salary. When I went to the house the man handed me 500 in currency.

My tasks in the house were cleaning, washing and other housework. There was about 600 chickens and I had to feed them twice a day. I had no time for sleep.  I started work at 10pm each night, I went to sleep and 8pm, got up at 10pm. I had only 2 hours of sleep a day. It was like that everyday. When I stayed in that house I had no freedom. I couldn’t go anywhere. Anytime I would go out, a guard would keep an eye on me. His house was equipped with six cameras, which spun in four directions. Whatever I did and wherever I went, he could see me. One day, one of his chickens died, so he blamed me for killing his chicken. He beat me with a cane that was as thick as my arm and it was very long. He beat me so hard that my arms swelled up and I could no longer do anything. When a lot of chickens died, he used power cables to chain my neck and legs. There was a time he tied me up and used a live power cable to shock me.

After having problems with my friend my parents sent me to Thailand. When I arrived in Thailand from Myanmar I started working on a rubber plantation. [One day while he was sleeping armed strangers entered his home and forced him into a van] I saw that a girl and two boys were already in the car. The girl and the two boys were blindfolded. As soon as I was put into the car, they blindfolded me. I didn’t know where they were going, but I knew what they were going to do to me. I had heard stories of humans being sold. That’s how I knew I was going to be sold. They took off my blindfold and untied my hands. I was being held by a huge Thai guy on my left and a thin Thai guy on my right. They forced me onto the fishing boat. That evening, the net master came to see me. He said, “You’re going to work for me, you’ve been sold to us.” He explained to me, “If you work for 6 months, you’d be able to pay back your debt. After that you are free to go wherever you want.” He said, “You’ve been sold. Escaping is impossible.” While at sea, we started working at 6am pulling the nets out of the waters. Each time took four hours. We had to do this six times per day. Sometimes we had to work for 24 hours straight, without even a single hour of sleep. The most dangerous work was fixing the fishing nets while the boat was moving. In order to fix the net, we had to stand on a very small outer-rim that’s about four fingers wide. That was the most dangerous time for us. If you fell into the water, your entire body would be chopped up by the propellers of the boat. Sometimes we weren’t allowed to sleep for two or three days. When our boat docked, a lot of Myanmar and Cambodian fishermen were fighting each other. The captain, the second captain, the net master and the engine mechanic, they were all focused on the fight.

Due to the fishing industry relying on trans-shipments at sea to reduce expenditure, some find themselves trapped on long-haul trawlers for years at a time. This makes the monitoring of enslaves labour on fishing vessels costly and difficult. The Thai Government has faced severe pressure to tackle forced labour specifically in the fishing sector, with the European Commission threatening a trade ban in 2015 for not taking sufficient measures to combat illegal and unregulated fishing that would cause the loss of up to US$1.4million a year in seafood exports. As a result the Government have reportedly accelerated efforts to combat labour exploitation, however despite this most workers in the Thai fishing sectors remain unregistered. Ko Min was working on a rubber plantation when he was abducted, sold and forced on to a fishing boat. Told he had to work to pay off debt Ko Min was forced to work for up to three days at a time with no sleep. Eventually the boat docked and with the captain distracted Ko Min was able to escape, borrowing money and hiring a motorbike to travel to Hat Yai he was reunited with his brother and the rest of his family."
Kyi Kyi,2012 (Narrative date),Forced labour Forced marriage,Forced marriage,China (slavery location),"Before I was trafficked, I lived with my husband and his parents. I sold betel nut for a living. Life became harder and I could no longer sell betel nut. Then I went to see a recruiter. I knew her as she lived on the same street as me. I had heard she did business along the border area. I asked her to help me. At that time, the situation at my home was not good. She took advantage of the situation and told me “It’s not good to stay here. Your husband’s parents are no good, so it’s better for you to go work there.” Her encouragement made me want to go there, so I did. When I enquired about the job they reassured me that the work was in Mandalay. Therefore I went along. Working as a domestic worker could earn about 40 thousand kyats per month, but we could also earn another 40 to 50 thousand on the side. We’d be able to send 40, 50, perhaps even 80 thousand kyats home. Also, we could go back home once a month if we wanted to. The salary was good too. If I worked for 4 to 5 months we could afford to live independently from my husband’s parents. So I went along with her.  Upon reaching Mandalay, I found out we were to continue to Muse. I said, I’m not coming because I was told we’d be only be going to Mandalay. When I said this, they told me I’d have to reimburse them a total amount of 200,000 kyats for transportation, meals and broker fees. I didn’t have the money to pay them and I thought I could come back from Muse too, so I went along. I was still convinced I was going there for legitimate work. Only once we got to Kyae Gaung did they tell me I had to marry a Chinese man. If I didn’t marry him, I would have to pay back the money by working at a brothel in Kyae Gaung. When I got there, a Myanmar translator arrived and told me what was happening. Only then I found out the entire story. How naïve I had been. She told me that they had bought me. If I didn’t marry him, I would be abused and would have to pay back all the money. If I had agreed to marry him it would have been different, but since I didn’t he felt humiliated. He was not kind to me because I had cost him money. When his relatives beat me, he didn’t say a word and just watched. They said that they would abuse me until I would marry this Chinese man. Every day for 4, 5 or 6 months, they came at night around 8pm. They came in disguise and locked me in a room. They beat me with sticks, pulled my hair and banged my head against the wall.  It usually lasted for 2 hours, then they left me, locked me up. I was in such pain I couldn’t move. I was injured. My legs were swollen and inflamed. The joints of my hands and legs were very painful. But I wasn’t allowed to get any treatment. I was beaten like that for 6 months. The gates of the house were always locked. They never let me out. His uncles said, “If she does not want to marry him, so be it. Let her work and then one day she may change her mind.” The family worked in the fields at the bottom of a hill from 6am to 7pm each day. They made me work there because I had cost them money. They never considered giving me a salary of even pocket money. I earned their trust and learned their language. After a while, they believed I would no longer run away and that I could be left unsupervised. I got permission to go back to the house early. I checked if anyone was coming with me. When I reached home, there were not Chinese relatives there. I let myself in, quickly packed my clothes and ran away. I took a bus to the big city. Three Chinese men approached me since I was crying and carrying many bags. They asked me how I got here and I told them my story in basic Chinese. They pitied me and gave me money, water and snacks. Then they called the police. My parents-in-law didn’t want my husband to take me back when I returned home. But he said, “Even if a plate is used, it can be washed and reused, whatever may have happened to my wife in the past, the important thing is what she is like in my hands right now. This is my wife and I take her back.” We reunited and decided to have a baby. I hope that nobody will have to experience what happened to me. People should make their own decision, and think twice before going. If you believe those who use money as bait and follow them, your life will be gravely affected. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," The internal migration of Chinese people seeking work has created an opportunity for human traffickers in China. Moreover the gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them. The prevalence of poverty in China makes the poor more vulnerable to enslavement. With the National Bureau of Statistics estimating that 70,170,000 are still living in poverty, people are more desperate and thus more likely to be receptive to fraudulent job offers. Kyi Kyi was looking for employment when a recruiter offered her work as a domestic worker in Mandalay that provided a good salary she could send home to her husband. However, upon reaching Mandalay, Kyi Kyi was told she must continue on to another location or pay for transportation, meals and broker fees. Unable to pay, Kyi Kyi was forced to continue on and upon arrival in Kyae Gaung was told she had been bought and had to marry a Chinese man. When she refused she was locked in a room, beaten daily for six months and forced to labour in the family’s fields. After a while Kyi Kyi was able to learn the family’s language and gain their trust which enabled her to eventually escape by bus to the city where she was aided by locals who called the police."

Lin,2012 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Vietnam (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"My family works in agriculture, growing corn and rice, that’s what we’ve lived on. Because my family’s situation was so difficult, I had to go out to earn some money to support them. She told us that working in China would earn from 1000 to 1500 [CNY] per month, and she would cover the travel expenses, also the boss there would take care of food and lodging. When we arrived there and got off at the station, the owner of a brick factory came to pick us up. He gave each person 50 [CNY]. Actually that 50 [CNY] was not enough to buy food for one week, because the food there was very expensive and we couldn’t afford it. If the boss didn’t give us the money, we didn’t have any other option, we’d go hungry and wouldn’t be able to work. We were exhausted at the time but didn’t know what to do, because if we didn’t work, the boss would beat and shout at us. So we were forced to do the work. If we wanted to escape, we couldn’t during the daytime because they watched us very closely. So we couldn’t run away. In order to escape we couldn’t get out straight away, we had to hide in the forest for a couple of days before we got out. If we left the brick factory and the boss found out, he would drive the car to the station to stop us. If caught, he’d beat us to death and not show us any mercy or let us go home. When we got home we shared our story to everyone in the village. However there were some people who didn’t believe us and continued to go there. You should have a good understanding of the job, before you go for it. But if you’re not sure about a job, you shouldn’t take it. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," China remains a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subject to forced labour. There have been a number of media reports exposing cases of forced labour in the country, especially among the disabled whose families are unable to care for them and with an underdeveloped government support system leaving them vulnerable. The disparity of work opportunities between rural and urban populations has created a high migrant population vulnerable to human trafficking. The lure of a higher income leads many migrant workers to accept jobs in China without knowing exactly what they entail. Lin travelled to China with his friend Trong from Vietnam when he was told he could get housework near the border. He was told his travel expenses, food and accommodation would be taken care of and he would earn a good salary. However, upon arrival he found himself in debt bondage, forced to work long hours under the threat of violence in a brick kiln to pay off his incurred fees. Eventually Lin was able to escape along with his friend Trong, hiding out in a nearby forest to avoid discovery. "
Marcela,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,Mexico (trafficked from) Children,Mexico (slavery location),"One day, I wanted to go downtown… while I was waiting for my friends at the bus stop, this guy shows up and starts asking me – “What’s your name?”, “How old are you?”… “Do you live near here?”, “Do you study?”, “Do you work?”, “What do you do?” He says “Well, I’ll just to be your friend.” And he tell me about his life story and I tell him about mine… Our stories basically matched… He came from an abusive family, his father didn’t love him… He told me he was a salesman and that he travelled a lot. So I said to myself… this is a good thing. And when we met again. He asked me if I wanted to live with him, he told me he’d fallen in love with me. That’s what gets you. Because you’re usually alone in life and when someone comes along and says “I love you” or “You’re very pretty,” you feel like they’re giving you the moon and the stars. But the thing about him was that he used to put ideas in my mind, subtly. “What if you started working?” And I’d always ask “Doing what?” “Providing sexual services.” So the next day he explains to me the different services provided… and where I would go. He sends me to meet a girl. I’d never thought we would got to a “hotel”… those “hotels”. The girl tried to convince the hotel owner to let me work. She didn’t let me work. First of all, because I was a minor. And because I didn’t have an ID. He told me to go get some color photos taken. And by the next day, I already got my ID. I was already eighteen, when I was thirteen.  If I didn’t make the money, he’d hit me and hit me. That was all he’d do. At certain places the clients preferred younger women, girls. Because they looked fresher. They were like a fantasy to them. “Since I can’t rape one, I can go to a hotel to find one.” And there we were. And I’d ask myself “Why are you still here? Why don’t you leave?” I heard lots of stories of girls who tried to escape and they’d end up dead. That kind of life… goes by very slowly, as if it were a movie. It sounds like a movie, but it’s not.

Maria,2012 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery Children,Mexico (trafficked from) Children,Mexico (slavery location),"I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, with my mom. I was three years old when she died. And I went to live with my aunt and uncle for a while, but later my grandpa started to try to abuse me. He’d always tell me he’d give me money if I let him touch me. So once I told my aunt, but she didn’t believe me. She said I was lying, and that I was trying to cause trouble in the family. So then my aunt took me to a lady who had two daughters. The first week I was with the lady she treated me well, but later she became aggressive with me. She started to treat me like a girl who worked in her house. I was like Cinderella at that house. I had to wash their clothes for the three of them. I had to wash the dishes and clean the bathrooms, clean the bedrooms. They had everything they needed. They had more clothes than me. I only had a little dress and a pair of underwear. At night I had to take off my dress, wash it and wear it the next day. The daughters had their own beds and everything. We shared the same room but I’d sleep on a piece of cardboard. With no blankets of anything. That was all I had and… I wouldn’t eat with them. Later, they’d finish their breakfast and I had to clear everything and wash the dishes and clean up, because later she’d make me go sell. I’d sell firecrackers. The first time I went out to sell I didn’t know how. So I came back with everything. I hadn’t sold anything. And she hit me and asked me why I didn’t sell anything. And I couldn’t even answer her I just told her I didn’t know how. And she started hitting me. She had her daughter go get a lamp cable and she used that to hit me. After a long time I got up the courage to answer her. To ask her why she did it if I was doing her a favor. So they’d have food. And she got really mad and she started… it was the first time she made me bleed. She pushed me into the bedroom and hit my head. And she told me to stay there. So I lay down and started remembering my mom. And I started thinking that the next day I’d go out to sell and I wouldn’t go back to the house. So that day I escaped. I ran off. And I told the woman who would always buy stuff from me that I needed her help, because the lady was mistreating me and I couldn’t take it anymore. So she said we had to go see the lady… with the police, to see what she’d do. And the lady started talking to me sweetly, saying: “No, I don’t do that to you. You have everything you need here. I don’t know why you ran away. We never disrespect you here.” And her eldest daughter said: “Mom, you’ve always mistreated her. The girl was right to run away.” So that’s when the police and the woman realized it was true, besides the fact that I had marks on my body. Then the woman told me I’d go somewhere else, where I’d get an education, love and I’d become part of a family. And since I’ve been there my life changed completely. Now I’m doing very well at school. My dream is to be a flight attendant or a dance teacher. When I see those kinds of children, I remember what I went through. And it’s sad for me to see them because now I’m in a better place. And I’d like those kids I see to have what I have now. Maybe one day there will be peace in the world and no child exploitation. And children’s rights will be respected. Because they’re entitled to that as children. Don’t be afraid to tell someone what you’re going through, because if you don’t, you’re going to be stuck there. And you have to be brave and get out of it and change your life completely, so you can forget about everything you’re going through.

This has made children one of the most vulnerable groups of people subjected to labour exploitation in the country. 42.5 percent of children working in Mexico do not receive any income for their labour. The current prevalence of poverty in the country has meant that many families require children to contribute to the household income in order to survive. Moreover Mexico is home to thousands of street children who constitute a particularly vulnerable group often subjected to forced labour and sexual exploitation. Maria was taken by her aunt to a family for whom she was to provide domestic work. Though initially treated well, Maria was soon forced to work long hours, providing the family with anything they needed and cleaning up after them. Maria was also required to sell firecrackers at the local market, subjected to physical abuse if she did not manage to sell them. Eventually Maria was able to escape after telling a woman at the market that she needed help and calling the police.  "
Marina,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Russia (slavery location),"It was hard to find work as an interior designer, so I started to work as a seamstress in a sewing room. My situation was such that my parents became ill. My husband didn’t help financially at all, he also drank a lot. The situation forced us to split up. I ended up with no money for living expenses. I had to look for a job. I found a job in the newspaper. The ad said that seamstresses were needed in Moscow. It was a good salary. A woman spoke to me over the telephone. She said the salary would be $1000 (USD). Housing would be provided in a dormitory, and the working day would be as usual, 8 hours. My situation was very desperate. It looked like the only way out. When I came to the railway station I saw the woman and six more girls. All the girls were pretty good looking. When we arrived in Moscow there were two cars waiting for us. We were brought somewhere into a suburb in Moscow region. It was some village. We got out and saw a private house. We were offered tea there. She said that this was the place we were meant to meet the employer. A man came in. He wasn’t alone. He entered but didn’t greet us and then started saying we would work for him. He spoke to us in a very rude way. One girl started to speak up and said, “Let us go, we want to go home.” She was then dragged by her hair into the next room. We heard she was beaten and raped. After some time she was dragged back. It was a lesson for us. She was covered in blood and raped by two people. It was such a shock! We suddenly understood what kind of job this was. Our personal things, our documents, all of our bags were taken away. We were taken outside and loaded into a car. We were driven to another house. It was almost dark. They took us underground. There were no windows, only mattresses on the ground. We saw other girls there. They told us we were now enslaved as sex workers. So the woman we had met was the recruiter and she sold people. They said the woman received $500 (USD) for each girl. The owner told us what our duties were. If we were to deviate from the duties we’d be punished. The customers would pay the guards. Once I saw the amount was about $50 (USD). It was totally unhygienic. We were asking to be able to wash at least. They tortured us by hosing us down first with cold water, then with boiling water. They probably did it for fun, because they enjoyed it. I think they fed their dogs better than us. They would call on a person up to ten times a day. They had a variety of requests too. We had no way to refuse anything for them. Sometimes they were drunk or under the influence of drugs. They forced us to do everything they said. Some of them like to put a plastic bag over our heads to see us gasping. Other would beat us or make cigarette burns. There was a case when one girl was taken to the client, he’d been before. His behavior was sadistic. She started shouting and the clients complained to the guards so they took her away. We didn’t see her for some time. And then they brought her in and threw on the floor. She was in a terrible, crippled condition. She’d been beaten and was covered in blood, cuts and burns. We tried to help her as best we could. I also got into the hands of a ‘troubled’ client, so to speak. He was under influence of drugs. He had insanely scary eyes. He put a knife to my throat and tried to burn me with his cigarette. I started shouting, trying to get him away from me. He threw me out the window. I fell very badly and injured my back. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t do anything. I was picked up by the guards, who began beating me even more. They found me unfit to… How do I say… unfit to work. She gave me some money and told me the owner ordered me to leave. They gave me my passport back and told me never to contact the police, or to anyone else as they knew where I lived. Finally, hitch-hiking, I reached home.

Women are lured by the promise of lucrative employment and a new location, travelling to the country under the pretence of legitimate employment and a better life. However when they arrive, they are forced into prostitution in brothels, hotels and saunas. There is also evidence of traffickers advertising sexual services of children online. However, despite the evidence of sex trafficking in Russia, it remains an under-recognised area of enslavement in the country.

Oksana,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour Sexual exploitation,Ukraine (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Russia (slavery location),"I looked for jobs here and there and eventually I got a job at the market. We decided to take a loan to buy a washing machine and a fridge. I worked at the market and sold household cleaning products. I started to suffer from allergies to the chemicals. My health was more important so I quit this job and registered at the state employment center. We had no money to make the repayments. With my husband at home, we started to have arguments “You don’t work!”, “You don’t work either!” “You wanted to take a loan. Now how will we pay? Think! The interests are growing.” They offered work as a retailer of Chinese goods at the wholesale market. The salary was for $500 - $600 (USD) a month. Accommodation and meals were free of charge. I asked her, “Can I go with you?” and she replied, “If you want to. You’re welcome.” So we went. There were four of us – my friend, two more people and I. A rather nice middle-aged man met us at the railway station. He wasn’t suspicious at all. He talked nicely with us, in a friendly normal manner. He said, “Girls! Don’t worry, everything is going to be alright. You’re gonna have a cool job, and will earn money!” We arrived at the wholesale market. He brought us to a large warehouse full of packages and giant bags with Chinese goods in them. An owner walked out and approached him. They talked about something, then that owner put about three bags in the vehicle. And then our guide said, “Alright, girls, I have to leave you now. If you don’t like something here, just let me know and I’ll come to pick you up. Don’t worry, everything will be fine.” There was a moment when one of our girls tried reaching the top shelf to get a bag with a specific tag. She lost her balance and fell down. These bags pressed her down. She was going to suffocate if we didn’t help her. Then we panicked. Because we thought today it was her, tomorrow it could be me. We talked about this to the owner and asked him to pay our weekly wage. We asked him to call the same person who brought us here, so that he take us away. He started making calls and talking to someone. In a few hours our guide arrived. “If you don’t like it here, get ready. I’ll take you to another place”. Finally, he brought us to the outskirts. There was an abandoned stock base there. Surrounded by a high fence. At this point he finally started to reveal his true character. He wasn’t smiling anymore. He said, “Get out! If you don’t, I’m gonna shoot!” He took out a gun and fired a shot into the air. We got out of the vehicle. What else could we do? They took us into a building to a tiny room. There were these wooden pallets and dirty mattresses of unknown origin on the floor. In the middle of the night two of these so-called guards came to us. Drunk. One said to me and another girl, “Come out.” Naturally, they forced us out of the room. They led us to a room where they had been drinking. They were looking for sex. We refused, of course, but they beat us up, tied us up and did what they wanted. It felt like being crushed, like you didn’t exist anymore. You’re not you, you’re nobody. They told us, “You still have to work off what we paid for you.” The next day we were taken to the work site. It was just a basement, which turned out to be an underground fake vodka distillery. Our task was to bottle the vodka, which they were producing, to stick on the labels. They didn’t even give us a minute to sit down, they were almost over us with whips. “Quicker and quicker.” We waited in terror until the end of working day, for night to come. Because they could come at any time and take us away, which would be putting it lightly. I ended up just saying, “Give me vodka.” So that I didn’t feel anything. We were hitchhiking. The trip back took three days, two nights of which we spent in the woods. Fortunately, we met some good, kind people who helped us cross the border, and we reached Ukraine. Then we travelled back home by commuter trains. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Forced labour accounts for 98 percent of cases of modern slavery in Russia. Made up of both Russian and foreign workers, particularly from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, these people are enslaved in the agricultural and construction sectors, in factories, private homes, forestry, automotive and fishing industries. Russia also stands as the second largest migrant receiving country in the world, and remains one of the top 5 destinations for Ukrainians seeking work. These migrant workers often rely on underground networks and intermediaries, not knowing exactly what work they are committing to. Increased unemployment, poverty and demands for cheap labour among Russian citizens, along with the flow of cross-border migration has created new pockets of vulnerability and opportunities for labour exploitation in the country.

Oleg,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour Trafficking,Russia (trafficked from) Trafficking,Russia (slavery location),"At the age of 18, I started working. At that time I wanted to live independently, to buy a car and earn money. I worked at a restaurant as a security guard. But of course, no matter how much money one has, it’s never enough. We want more, and more, and even more. I found a job in the newspaper. The salary was from $1000 (USD) up to $2000 (USD) for plastering work. Transportation, accommodation, and meals were free of charge. There was also a group of workers who were also with me. The meeting was at the station. We were told, “Get yourself the tickets for a specific date”. We packed up and set out. There was a man, the recruiter, he was traveling with us. My father kept saying that one should always check where one is going and under what terms. So we arrived to the Kursk railway station in Moscow. We were sorted into the buses. There were about 3 buses. The first thing we noticed when we arrived at the site was a fence about 4 meters with a barbed wire. We thought that it must be an important construction, if such security was required. Our passports were taken from us. They explained that it was to avoid issues with the police. Just a crumbling, run-down building, the windows were covered with buckram and there were those plated beds like in a prison, there was nowhere to wash or take a bath. The work was the complete opposite of the plastering work we were expecting. We had to stand on platforms, and demolish the building by hand with crowbars. After that we loaded trolleys with the bricks. Moreover, we were working 5-6 meters high and there were no safety wires or anything else to protect us. Once a guy was digging a ditch, and he got an electric shock. He was unconscious, his clothes were burnt, only the soles of his sneakers were left. We tried to unglue the burnt sole from his foot. He’d been shocked by 2000-3000 electricity volts. We asked to call an ambulance for him, but no one did anything. Any violations of the rules, resistance or attempted escape was severely punished by the guards. This was to intimidate the other slaves. A group of three people did try to escape. They were beaten almost to the death, people were coughing up blood at night. One man had his rib broken. The other two couldn’t get up for 10 days. We were told, “No one will know if some of you disappear. No one will ever know.” The driver as it turned out, he was also from Ukraine. He passed us a note. It said, “If you want to escape from here, I can help you”. There was a time, date and place where he could meet us. We stole the passports when the guard’s backs were turned. I mean our own documents. We had to jump over the fence at a specific place. We had platforms of the required height on hand in preparation, so we could do everything quickly. At about 1.30AM we started to move.  One by one, we slipped out and started to climb the fence. The driver was waiting about 100-150 meters away. We ran there quickly, then drove for about 5-7 kilometers, then he dropped us off. He said, “I can’t go further with you.” Thank God a truck eventually stopped, we told the driver everything that had happened. We told him of our situation. And he helped us. He gave us a lift and we reached Moscow. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Forced labour accounts for 98 percent of cases of modern slavery in Russia. Made up of both Russian and foreign workers, particularly from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, these people are enslaved in the agricultural and construction sectors, in factories, private homes, forestry, automotive and fishing industries. Russia also stands as the second largest migrant receiving country in the world, these migrant workers often rely on underground networks and intermediaries, not knowing exactly what work they are committing to. Increased unemployment, poverty and demands for cheap labour among Russian citizens, along with the flow of cross-border migration has created new pockets of vulnerability and opportunities for labour exploitation in the country. Wanting to live independently Oleg took a job he found in a newspaper. Oleg was taken from Moscow along with other men to an unknown location. Forced to live and work in unsanitary and dangerous conditions, the men were threatened with violence at any suggestion of resistance. With the help of one of the bus drivers, Oleg was eventually able to escape and make his way back to home."
Posvak,2012 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,"",Cambodia (slavery location),"When I was young I wished to have a career that enabled my family to get by like others. But my dreams didn’t come true because I was so poor and illiterate. I didn’t have a job. I didn’t have any farm land either. I found out about the job on the radio. I phoned the agency and I was offered a ride there. They told me that my job was just to do the housework. They said that in a day, 24 hours, I would only work 8 hours and I would be paid US $180 per month. The contract was for a period of 2 years. The reason I believed it was legal was because I found the advertisement pretty reliable. The contract made in Cambodia stated the working hours, but when I arrived there, no specific time was set. They asked me to work around the clock. Out of 24 hours, I had only 2 hours to take a rest. My employer had 10 siblings and along with their parents, they lived in 11 houses. They all lived separately and I had to work for all of them. After I finished the housework, I was ordered to wash his sick father. If I didn’t finish the work, they wouldn’t give me any food, so I didn’t have energy to work. Even though I got ill, they didn’t allow me to rest. There were big CCTV cameras installed in their house. Wherever I went and even when I was standing somewhere, they would see me. In the bathroom, they installed a camera to videotape me naked and they watched it. When they got mad, they beat me and tore my clothes, leaving me naked. If he got angry, I had to work all day without wearing any clothes. They laughed at me when I was naked. When I asked the employer to let me call my family, they refused, so I felt hopeless. If I didn’t work hard, he would not send me back to Cambodia, he would tear my passport and keep me there. The employer said that he bought me from the company in Cambodia. The grandfather gave me a phone to call my mother. I asked her to inform the organization that I could not return to Cambodia because I was sold. Then my mother brought my words to the organization’s attention. When I first realized that I was deceived, I felt very ashamed. I was afraid to talk with my friends and relatives. When the villagers knew I had experienced such hardship, they strongly criticized me and wouldn’t associate with me. Before going to a country to work as a domestic worker, please make sure you have a contract, a passport and adequate documents. Make sure the passport and contract are witnessed by the village or commune authority before you go.  As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit."," Cambodia remains a source country for the exploitation of men, women and children in all forms of modern slavery including forced labour, debt bondage and forced marriage. Cambodian women eager to escape impoverished lives in rural villages are often deceived in to forced work on farms, as domestic workers or in factory jobs. Cambodian men are vulnerable due to their need to travel to secure employment. They are often subjected to forced labour on fishing vessels in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the increasing demand for cheap domestic workers in private homes in the Middle East, Malaysia and Singapore, along with the possibility of tripled income has encouraged Cambodian women to travel abroad, often through informal channels for employment as maids, nannies and carers. The Government of Cambodia is making progress in combating trafficking. However this progress has been slow, and there are many challenges ahead. In 2014, the government released a five-year National Plan of Action (NPA) (2014—2018) devised by the National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT)."
Pramilla,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was as good as dead. How could a living thing feel like that? For as long as I can remember, we have been poor. My mother was always unwell. We didn’t even have proper food and clothes. Khirmi used to say if you go to the city you will get a good salary. You will only have to wash dishes. It’s a hotel. Khirmi told my mother that my sister was doing well. “She sent 1000 Rupayia and clothes also”. She told me that my sister wanted to meet me. It had been two months since I had seen my sister. I just really wanted to meet my sister... I was feeling happy. I was sitting by the window and looking out at the rivers and forests. There were no trees or forests anywhere. Only houses and huge buildings. And all types of vehicles. Then Khirmi told me “It’s not Nepal Gunj, it’s Delhi. There’s more money to be made here.” And then I saw my sister. She looked very different from before. She was fairer. She had proper make up on. She was wearing high heels. She was wearing a salwar kurta. At night the girls were talking to each other. It had been a good day – their clients had paid them well. I kept wondering what was going on. I was suspicious. But nobody told me anything. They said, “We sell beer. You will have to sell beer and drink with them.” But nobody told me that I had to have sex with them. Vinita came to see me. Before she had been very friendly but now she looked scary. And then she openly told me what I had to do. Vinita said she had bought me for Rs. 80,000. “Now you have to do whatever I say.” They gave me some odd clothes. It was a very short skirt. I said, I’m not doing this, send me home. I’m not that kind of girl. I’ve never been so scared before. I was so scared, so scared… I was terrified… It was like being dead. It was like the life had been taken out of you.  I was as good as dead. How could a living thing feel like this? [After 7 days of being tied to a bed and raped, she was untied. On the eleventh day, she escaped] I looked around. I didn’t see anybody. The security guard was due to change. The morning guard had left early and the new guard was yet to arrive.

Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centres and by foreign travellers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India. Pramilla was approached by a recruiter who had previously helped her sister obtain employment. Pramilla was taken from Nepal into Delhi’s red light district where her employer told her that she had been sold and must now work in the brothel. When she refused, Pramilla was tied to a bed for seven days and her employer brought in up to eight customers a day to rape her. On the eleventh day of her enslavement, Pramilla was able to escape. She now works with a non-profit organisation that rescues and rehabilitates victims of sexual exploitation."
Siti,2011 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Indonesia (trafficked from),Malaysia (slavery location),"When I was one my father passed away. Then when I was three my mother passed away. My grandfather raised me until I was fourteen. Then he passed away. I was still in school. I didn’t have any brothers or sisters. I was alone. I was very unhappy. I left Indonesia because I wanted to gain life experience, and to earn money for the future. I asked about the job, she said it’s factory work. I said I’d do it, but would I need to pay an agency fee? She said no, but my salary would be docked for five months. I believed her because she had an Indonesian relative who she’d also brought to Malaysia. I saw that she was successful and I was inspired. I wanted to be like her. When I got to the agent’s house I was shocked. There were so many people. There were lots of people coming and going for work. There were 71 people who lived there. In one room there were 10, 20 or 30 people. I was sad. I was really sad because I was tricked. The Indonesian and Malaysian agents tricked me. They said I’d work in a factory but when I got here I worked from house to house. I did everything from taking care of babies, old people… I had to bath and feed them.  If they urinated I had to change their diapers. If they were in pain I had to give them a massage. I worked seven days from eight in the morning until eleven or twelve at night. The door would be locked so we couldn’t leave. I wanted to run away because I couldn’t take it anymore. After I was caught and returned home the agent scolded and slapped me. (One night the agent lured Siti out of the house) I asked where he was taking me. He said I was going to look after a baby. He gave me an orange drink. After I drank it, I felt sleepy. He told me to sleep in the car. The next day, when I woke up I found myself naked. I didn’t have any clothes on and I was in pain. I don’t know who raped me because I was unconscious. I suspected that my employer had raped me but he denied it. For the whole five years I was there I didn’t receive a cent. I feel I’ll never be able to forget what happened, because it was the darkest time of my life. If I go back and tell people my story, I think my friends will treat me differently, they’ll think I’ve been tarnished so my reputation will be ruined.

Tatiana,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Netherlands (slavery location),"He’s been a few times at my parent’s and even my mother like him, and then he started, after half a year “Maybe we can go together to work on our future”. “Maybe to work in West Europe”. I was talking to my parents about it that I had some plans to leave the country. They were, in the beginning, quite against this. My mother just gave me a small brochure, it was something about trafficking, she said “In case of something because every mother will worry about something”.  She said “It could happen maybe on the road, somebody could take you or whatever, just have it with you, this number”. I just threw it away and got angry with her. Why did she give me this, why does she never trust me? For the moment I just wanted to enjoy the trip, he was quiet, very quiet. We arrived and there was waiting a guy, I think it is his friend. They just go off together, a little bit further on. And then came just the other guy, and he just said to me “We’ll get to the flat where you’ll stay”. And I just asked, “Where is my boyfriend?” he said, “Oh don’t worry, he’ll come back, he just has to go somewhere and then he’ll come back to the flat too”. “OK!” When I go in the flat, the guy started to explain to me, he said “You’ve just been sold and you have to work for me. You have to work in prostitution.  I had like a panic, I started to scream. When I realized what’s happening, that it was my boyfriend, I just hate him, I don’t know, I trusted him more than my mother. That person who’d been so nice for half a year and I know him so good, just changed and I realized that it was just acting and he did just his job. And he said “Don’t forget we know where you parents live, we know everything about your sister”. So he said “What do you think? It may be better to take one of your sisters who will pay for your mistake?” I didn’t know what to do, to call to don’t call, to run away, to don’t run away. It’s terrible. To think that a strange men, that you have to have sex. That you have to have sex with a total stranger, a dirty man. I cannot describe the feelings, I cannot. How miserable how dirty you feel. I felt really dirty. You feel not yourself, just like a piece of meat, I don’t know what. Sometimes you have to deal with 9 or 10 men a night. It’s horrible. So I told clients about my situation, but I never got more than, “oh, I’m sorry for you” or, “it’s a pity” or, it’s too bad for you “or “Oh, this is really terrible.” That’s it. Nothing else.

Thien,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Vietnam (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"We didn’t have steady jobs, that’s why we had to wait for the harvest. Sometimes the harvest would fail. We often went hungry. I was going to school while also making shoes at the shoe factory, then I got acquainted with the person who eventually sold me. I asked, “Where is my bicycle?” The he told me, “The bicycle has already been pawned, so now you’ll have to pay money to retrieve it.” So if I wanted to retrieve the bicycle then I would have to work to make money to get it back. If I went home without it my father would beat me. When my father beat me it hurt a lot. I was afraid because that was the only bicycle we had for the entire family. I didn’t know what kind of work I’d do to get the bicycle back. I only knew that I had to work. In the evening after we arrived in Quang Ninh we had dinner, then after he took me to meet a man. He introduced this man as his ‘uncle’. Later on that man took us to a motel. I didn’t think much of it, then that night, late that night, he raped me. At the time I was only fifteen years old. When we got to the Chinese border, I only heard people speaking Vietnamese, I didn’t know that we had arrived in China. We went over by boat and took a ferry to get to the other side. At that time, I was still a child so I didn’t know that the other side was China. That night the man he called ‘uncle’ raped me again. After that, he said if you don’t let me have sex, I won’t let you go home. At the time I was so afraid because over there people spoke a different language. I couldn’t speak and I couldn’t understand. After he forced me to have sex with him, he took me to a Vietnamese person’s house. These prostitution dens, they look just like normal people’s homes. Each day I had many customers. Sometimes I had 10 or more people a day. Some days I had up to 20 people. At that time, people watched me very closely. When I travelled to work, I was guarded. I was closely watched by the den’s boss. Since I started working, I was never allowed to hold the money. If they discovered I had any money on me, then they immediately beat me up. The boss said that the money was used to feed and house me, money for living expenses. I had to pay back the loan for the boat and car rides, and the costs of food and drinks. During the whole year I lived there, I stayed in many dens. Each time I was sold, I was passed to another boss. They beat and mistreated me. I tried to escape many times. Once I climbed to the rooftop from the second floor. I squeezed through then jumped down and fell. I tried to crawl away but I was captured, beaten and shocked. I was beaten up and left to starve for a long time. [One day Thien made another attempt to run away when she was sent on a job to a customer] I then tricked the customer and I ran away. I stole both his mobile phone and wallet but, when I got to the bus station I couldn’t run away. At the time, I couldn’t speak many words, I only knew a few sentences. When they heard the way I talked, they knew I was Vietnamese so they stopped me again. Back at home, my parents searched for me. We already had nothing. They had to sell all their land to get the money to look for me. They had tried to look for me for two years straight and couldn’t find me. My parents fell ill, they were sick with worry. When they heard my story about the kind of work I had done over there, my parents were upset. The neighbours also knew. Some were sympathetic, some weren’t. When I came back, a few people were sympathetic but most stayed away from me. Whenever I went out to meet friends, I saw that they too seemed to keep their distance from me. I felt bad inside. In Vietnam there are a lot of poor people. They like it when they hear that they can make a lot of money. I also think that my story is very important, is meaningful to a lot of people, especially teenagers. They trust people too easily. They are impulsive and don’t consider the consequences.

Nu,2000 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Thailand (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Japan (slavery location),"I am waiting to give birth to my baby. I hope it is not a girl. She must not suffer like me. I was abandoned by my parents and left to be brought up by distant relatives. I studied up to the primary level and did all the housework. When I reached puberty the son of the family I lived with began making advances towards me. He raped me several times, and began sending me out occasionally with clients for short periods, warning me never to tell his parents. I was already ‘spoilt’ and decided to run away and entertain clients on my own, instead of living under his control. I came to Bangkok at the age of 15, rented a room and began seeing clients independently. But getting enough and good clients was difficult, and operating independently without any protection was risky. A hairdresser friend suggested that I find a well-paying job outside the country that also took care of my food and accommodation. She said that there were plenty of Thai women who worked in Japan and returned rich. She said that if I didn’t know how to go about things, she would introduce me to an agent who would help me secure work in Japan. I was willing and an appointment was fixed. The agent interviewed me on my background. I told him that I had no relatives, that operating independently in Bangkok hardly got me good clients and money, and that I was worried that I wasn’t smart and good looking enough to go to Japan. He assured me that this was no problem at all, but that he would have to physically examine me before a final decision was made. He asked me to undress behind a makeshift screen, examined my body for ‘damage,’ and internally probed me with his bare hands to detect ‘disease.’ When he was satisfied that I was okay, he said I would be sent to Japan. I was told that I would be working as a waitress in a bar earning approximately $200 per month, and that I was not bound to go out with clients, but could if I chose to earn more. Agent’s fees and other expenses were to be paid after I received my first wage. From the time the agent began working on my travel documents to the time of my departure—which was a little over two weeks—I was kept in a small hotel room and provided with food. The agent said this was necessary in preparation for my departure. I learnt later that I travelled to Japan on a tourist visa and someone else’s passport affixed with my photograph. The day before my departure, I was told that I would be escorted from Bangkok airport by a Thai family—a man, his wife, their son and daughter. I was to pretend that they were my parents and siblings, and I was instructed by the agent to address them as mom and dad, and not to talk too much to them. I was specifically instructed not to talk to the Thai and Japanese immigration officials or to any authorities. My’ father’ would take care of everything. I had to demonstrate to the agent how I would behave with my family, to assure him I had understood his instructions. I was introduced to my ‘family’ at the airport. The man seemed to be a technician with Thai airways. I don’t know if those were really his wife and children, but they were all fair and well dressed, and seemed to know what to do. My father kept my passport with him. The agent gave me 30,000 yen [$250] for my expenses before we left. At Narita airport in Japan, my ‘father’ took care of the immigration procedures. After we collected our baggage, the woman went her own way with the boy and girl, and my ‘father’ led me away in the opposite direction, where we were met by a Japanese man with three young Thai women in his charge. My ‘father’ took the 30,000 yen from me, left me with the Japanese and disappeared. We were brought by taxi to a karaoke bar in Shinjuku. The owner was a Japanese, married to a Thai mama-san. The bar owner said that he did not accept girls with big tattoos and body marks and asked us to go one at a time into a cubicle at the back of the bar. I was asked to undress and the owner began pressing and massaging various parts of my body. He examined me vaginally. This was a repeat of the same procedure as in Thailand, but here the owner even slept with me before hiring me. I really felt horrible—’like a piece of flesh,’ being inspected, bought and sold. I had to take a blood test for HIV/AIDS. I was the only one of the four women bought by the bar. The other girls were taken elsewhere. I later learnt that if women tested HIV positive or were found physically unpleasing, they were bought only by lower grade bars where earnings are less and conditions much worse. As soon as the others left, the mama-san told me that I had to pay off a debt of over one million yen [$8000]. My food, rent and other expenses would be added to this amount. We did not receive commissions on drinks, although we had to persuade clients to buy drinks. Clients paid the mama-san directly for taking the women out during the debt repayment period. The mama-san warned me not to try to run away as she would be very tough, and that all girls who tried escaping were brought back by the Yakuza and severely beaten or sold to other bars, accumulating double the debt. I was shocked and realized that the only way for me to pay off my debt was to go out with as many clients as possible. Tips from clients were the only liquid cash we earned. Sometimes a generous client helped women pay off their debts. Our living quarters housed 30 girls between the ages of 14 and 30. Most were already in prostitution in Thailand before they came to Japan, but like me did not know they would have to go out with clients, pay off a huge debt, and live in total confinement. A few however had no idea at all they were being sold into prostitution and had a much harder time. We were packed into a small room with a bath-cum toilet above the mama-san’s house, far off from the bar. There was no radio or television and we were instructed to always talk softly or sleep when not at work. We were warned not to peep out of the window, as we would be arrested by the police who came on their daily rounds. It was very cold, but there was no heater or warm water. I was provided with a sheet, a blanket, a pillow, a pair of socks and had to sleep on the ground. We used to hold each other tight and sleep to keep warm. We generally worked through the night, slept in the morning and woke up in the early evening. We showered in batches to save time and water. We cooked and ate a routine meal of rice with raw, boiled, fried eggs or omelettes mixed with fish sauce and chillies and sometimes fried vegetables. I hated this food, but this was what we were given. It was also cheaper and that meant we could work our debts off faster. Other meals at the bar were ordered through the mama-san from an adjoining Thai restaurant, and added to our debts. We were never allowed direct communication with the restaurant workers or anyone else. Even our letters were censored. By 6:30pm we were ready to be escorted to the bar. Most of us consumed drugs or gulped down alcohol before leaving for work. Our regular supply came from the mama-san and was added to our debts. I used a drug called domikum which made me feel happy, funny and carefree. It helped me lose all inhibitions and I never felt intense pain when on it. Most of us didn’t know Japanese and were forced to engage in body communication with clients. We had to sit very close to clients, touch and be touched by them, wear short dresses with spaghetti straps without any underwear, or walk around the bar stark naked to attract customers. I could only do this when high. We could never refuse a client who wanted to go out with us, even if he was dirty, smelly or absolutely drunk. If a girl resisted being prostituted or accepting a specific client, she was badly beaten. Girls have been raped publicly in front of all of us by the Yakuza, especially called in to season them. This terrorizes other girls. Some girls were burnt with cigarette butts, and their nails hammered with bottles. If a girl was really unmanageable, she was sold by the owner to the Yakuza and we never saw or heard of her again, or she was sold to another bar with double the debt to repay. Also our mama-san would send us out with known sadistic clients when we disobeyed her, and girls came back very traumatized. Some behaved as if they were raving mad. In the one year that I stayed in the bar I never saw a girl being murdered but heard of incidents from friends. I decided it was better to obey the mama-san, and pay off my debt as fast as I could, than suffer this fate. On an average, I entertained about three or four clients a night depending on the number of clients in the bar. Our clients were all Japanese between the ages of 20 and 70, but the majority were over 40. They liked young girls. Often the younger men swore love to us, but we knew it was only lust. They would soon drop us. Most of my young clients were very insensitive and rough. The older men tended to be gentler. Most of our clients thought that we had come to Japan because Thai women love sex. There were two girls out of the 30 in our bar who said they didn’t mind sex, provided it was not violent, but the rest of us drugged ourselves or drank to go through with it. We often got sadistic and kinky clients who were unknown to the bar owner—much more than I got in Bangkok. They would beat us before intercourse with sticks, belts or chains, till we bled. One of my clients wanted me to scream loud while beating me before sex, but he didn’t draw blood. Some impotent men used fake penises. There were some clients who inserted coke bottles into the girls’ vaginas; lit candles and dropped hot wax over our bodies and into the women’s vaginas; stared into a woman’s vagina and poured boiling water into it; gave the nipples electric shocks for a few seconds; or demanded oral or anal sex. If girls came back traumatized after going out with a sadistic client, and reacted hysterically or had nightmares, they would be beaten by the mama-san and told that they must have provoked the client to be violent. The mama-san never brought sadistic clients to book. If we cried on the job or resisted a client, we were beaten even more. That is why we routinely used drugs before sex, because then we didn’t feel the pain that much. We had to work even when we were ill or menstruating. We used to insert sponges during menstruation, to prevent clients from knowing that we were menstruating. The mama-san instructed us to tell our clients to use condoms. Some men would, but most not. As I could not speak Japanese I could not ask them to use condoms, so I would excite them and slip it on without them knowing. If clients refused to use condoms, we had to give in. The mama-san never asked them to use one. We used to have a pill a day supplied by the mama-san to avoid pregnancy. Of the 30 girls in the bar, while I was there, two got pregnant. They consumed some medicine and one of them aborted. The other got the girls to stamp her stomach till she aborted. Generally abortions were self-induced and facilitated by the girls in the bar. Letting the mama-san know that we were pregnant would get her angry, and seeking her help or going to a doctor would add to our debts. The abortificaient was secretly supplied by Thai restaurant workers, and the women were reported to consume five or six bottles before they aborted. The women complained of fatigue, abdominal pain and bleeding after that. We didn’t know much about STDS/AIDS, except the names of these ailments. Those of us who visited STD clinics had seen pictures of STD affected body parts. We were only taken to the doctor when we were unable to stand. The owner was afraid that his illegal operations and our illegal status would come to light if we were exposed to outsiders. Those who were taken to doctors had stiff fees added to their debts. Many of the girls complained either of a burning sensation or pain while urinating. We were told by the Thai restaurant owners that this was syphilis and were supplied with orange tablets at a price. We did not know what the drug was, but it made us feel better. Other health problems were stomachaches, fevers, injuries, nervousness, hysteria, emotional disturbances, mental breakdowns, including suicides. Some girls got drunk and urinated and vomited all over, and the mama-san increased their debts as a penalty. Others who took drugs got aggressive. We were under constant pressure and we often fought, screamed and punched one another. There was also a lot of peer bonding as we had only one another to depend on. One of the girls who was depressed and drunk once slashed her wrists with a broken bottle, but fortunately did not cut herself deeply. She was going crazy in controlled conditions, got few clients, and felt she would have to work in the bar forever to pay off her debts. She would often get hysterical. We would try and calm her with medication, get her food and use the little Japanese we knew to get her clients. A girl in the next building jumped out of the window and died instantly. The mama-san and the girls left the premises and we don’t know what happened after that. Sometimes the police would come in to check if there were visa-overstayers. The owner was mostly warned in advance by informants. Overstayers would be concealed, or heaped into a bus and hidden in a hotel close by in the mountains till the police left. At other times the bar would be closed for a day or two. There was also a time when only those with valid visas were produced before the police, and the police bribed. Of the 30 women in the bar, four tried to escape, two successfully with the help of clients. The other two were caught and returned to the bar by the police only to be mercilessly beaten up by the owner. The mama-san told us that the girls who escaped would be tracked down and killed. Every single one of us dreamed about escaping. Several of us made plans but were too afraid to act on them. When debts were paid off, the mama-san returned our passports, and we were free to either leave or stay for a month or two and earn something. Most women in our bar wanted to return to Thailand immediately, but had to stay back and earn some money to buy their return tickets and save a little before returning. Thai dealers in restaurants fixed our papers and return tickets for a fee. We were too afraid to go to the Thai embassy because we were told that the embassy officials would cut our hair and throw us into jail, as we were illegal residents. Many girls who dared to leave the bar to work independently after repaying their debts, were arrested by the police, fined, imprisoned, forced to provide sexual favors to the police and deported. It’s funny because we are punished for no fault of our own, but the bar owners, the corrupt police and even clients who abuse us badly are never punished. I finished repaying my debt in ten months. I had some money from tips, but not at all enough to buy my return ticket. I worked for two months more in the bar. With the Japanese I picked up in a year, I then began to solicit clients in front of one of the motels close by. I had a boyfriend whom I lived with. I realized he was not serious about me and was not going to marry me. I had no education, no job, no accommodation, was an illegal resident, and could not return to Thailand immediately without earning something reasonable. So I stayed on with my boyfriend and went out with clients to save some money. One day I happened to walk into a Thai restaurant and found a pamphlet that said, “If you need a Thai friend to talk to, contact this number.” I rang the number and found myself talking to a Japanese nun. I told her my story and requested her to help me get back to Thailand. She made the necessary arrangements and sent me to an NGO in Thailand. I returned with a saving of 30,000 baht [$685] after five years of struggle. No one in the world can get over sleeping with one man after another who does not love you. These men want to come to us but don’t love us or don’t want to marry us. They only use us. The bar owners, recruiters or clients are never blamed for what they do to us. I don’t trust the police or the embassy. In Japan I hated to be so controlled. I feel ashamed about being in prostitution, but I can’t change my past. I haven’t told my present boyfriend about Japan. I feel embarrassed when people look at me. I think they do so because they know I was a prostitute. I talk loud and rudely. I must take drugs even now, after being so long in prostitution. It makes me feel strong. Society does not accept us. Only women in prostitution won’t look down on me, and can understand me.","Of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 individuals trafficked across international borders each year, some 80 percent are women and girls. Nu was one of the thousands of women trafficked annually out of Thailand for sexual exploitation. The major destinations include Japan, Malaysia, Bahrain, Australia, Singapore, and the US. Internal trafficking occurs within the country as well, usually from northern Thailand (where hill tribe women and girls are denied Thai citizenship). In Japan, where she was enslaved, women are trafficked from Thailand, the Philippines, Russia, and Eastern Europe, and on a smaller scale from Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Burma, and Indonesia. Nu was repeatedly raped by a relative and escaped to Bangkok at the age of 15 to work as a prostitute. She was tricked into leaving for Japan with the promise of waitress work. She spent ten months enslaved in a “karaoke bar” in Shinjuku, a Tokyo district, and another four years working as a prostitute after her escape. Her narrative describes the involvement of other women in the process of enslavement: a hairdresser friend and the “mama-san” (brothel manager). The percentage of female traffickers is rising. Some have been trafficked themselves and then reappear as recruiters or pimps. Others are blackmailed by criminals. Female traffickers are often the most convincing at deceiving women and girls into accepting fake job offers and so beginning the journey into slavery."
Nuch,1995 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Thailand (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Japan (slavery location),"The agent told me she could find a job for me in a Thai restaurant in Japan and that I could make several tens of thousands a month. She agreed to pay for all of my expenses, saying that I could pay her back once in Japan. I didn’t know anything about exchange rates or different currencies so I didn’t know how much 380 bai [$30,000] was, but it didn’t sound like a lot. I asked how long it would take me to pay it back, and the agent said five months. I didn’t carry my own passport to go through Thai immigration. The agent gave both of our passports to immigration and talked to them. I arrived in Japan at night. At Narita airport immigration, the agent told me to go to a specific line and she went in another one. She went through first and then came to help me. She spoke Japanese and got me through. Then we took a taxi to a hotel in Tokyo. She told me I would work at a Thai restaurant that belonged to a Thai woman named Ice. Ice told me I was to stay here and that I shouldn’t speak Thai outside the apartment. She told me I couldn’t escape and not to even try. Another woman took the three of us. We traveled all day by train. Once off the train, I was separated from the others and brought straight to a snack bar. I was very cold because I had no winter clothes. The snack bar was very small and had only four other Thai women there. They worked and slept at the snack shop. The mama was a Taiwanese woman. They told me there was no way out and I would just have to accept my fate. The snack bar had many customers who I saw drinking alcohol and singing. I was told I had to go to sit with them. I knew then what had happened to me. That first night I had to take several men, and after that I had to have at least one client every night. When I first got to the apartment a Thai man slapped my face and said: “they told you not to meet other Thai.” Then Ice took me into another room. There Ice beat me, mostly by kicking me everywhere, while I sat in a chair. Ice beat me for over an hour saying: “I told you not to speak to any Thai.” I couldn’t fight back because there were many men outside the room. When Ice finished she took a visa photo of me and forced me to write a contract. I said I couldn’t write, but Ice forced me to write the contract by telling me each letter in Thai. I was forced to write that “if I try to escape again, I agree to be killed,” and then Ice forced me to sign it. Then Ice photocopied it and said she would give a copy to the next mama I was sent to work for. Ice then asked me: “do you want to go into a brothel where you’ll never come out or pay back a debt of 700 bai [$55,000]?” I didn’t know what a brothel was, but it didn’t sound good so I agreed to having my original debt doubled. I had to take all the clients that were introduced to me and was never given a day off. I was given birth control and charged 1000 yen [$8] per month. The only money I ever had was the tip money I saved. With the tip money, I had to buy my own food, except for rice, with the other women. Once I slipped and said I was from Thailand. The client asked the mama if it was true that I was from Thailand. It was a big problem. The mama’s daughter slapped me, and the Japanese husband of the mama told me: “if you tell another person you are Thai again you will have a name, but no body.” This meant he would kill me and only my name would be left. The mama’s daughter slapped me again another time, when I was told to serve a very rude, drunk and dirty client whom I had been forced to have sex with several times before and couldn’t stand it. She slapped me because I wasn’t eager enough to take this particular client. We were watched at all times. When we had to go out with clients, the mama hired taxis to wait for us at the hotel and bring the women back. There was never any chance to escape. We worked at the snack bar from 6pm to 3am, and at 9am we were woken up to clean the house and the snack bar before lunch. After lunch we worked in the field out behind the snack bar until dinner. We were given birth control pills and told not to take the white pills. So we never had our periods while working there. We worked and took clients everyday. I asked another Thai woman to help me write a letter to send to my mother. It had been a long time since I had written to my mother. I had never told my mother what I was forced to deal with or the details of my life. I just wanted to tell my mother that I was well and everything was okay. But, while I was telling the other Thai woman what to write, I slipped and said, “sorry I haven’t written to you for a long time. I have moved to another restaurant.” The Thai woman who was transcribing the letter asked me for more details. I told her then that I got sick and my blood was positive. Then this Thai woman went and told the mama—to get some extra points by telling on me. In all my time in Japan only about ten clients ever used condoms and even then they broke a couple of times. I did not know about AIDS then or what “blood positive” meant. One morning, the police came to arrest us. They asked me and the others in Thai if we wanted to go home, and if so to get our clothes. Only myself and one other woman got our clothes. Everyone was arrested, the mama, her husband, the two Taiwanese friends, and the seven Thai women. One Thai woman had just finished off her debt after two years and was about to be paid for the first time for 20 clients. She was especially upset.","Of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 individuals trafficked across international borders each year, some 80 percent are women and girls.

Nuch left for Japan in March 1992 at the age of 27 and was held in Tokyo. She explains that she apparently owed money for the trip and had to work off her debt with clients. After three months in slavery, she was taken to a police station, detained for several months in solitary confinement, and transferred to an immigration detention center, where she was held until the Thai Embassy issued travel documents. She flew back to Thailand in March 1993. Her narrative describes the involvement of other women in the process of enslavement. Her experience was at the hands of a long series of women: a Thai woman who got “extra points” by betraying her, a female agent, a woman who was the “boss,” and the Taiwanese “mama” (brothel manager).

Odeta,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Forced marriage,Albania (trafficked from) Forced marriage,Italy (slavery location),"I was born in a city in the south of Albania in a very problematic family environment. I am 16 years old. My father used to drink a lot, and he only worked sporadically. He still faces alcohol problems. He used to be violent when he was drunk and would physically abuse me, my mother, and my brother and sisters. Meanwhile my mother worked as a garbage collector, but all her salary was appropriated from my father in order to drink and gamble. About six years ago, my mother decided to leave my father, and she went to Italy illegally. We stayed with our aunt and grandmother. They raised us. Three years after my mother left Albania, she married an Italian man and was able to obtain all the necessary documents. She sent money for us to my aunt in order to help a little bit in our living. During this period of time my grandmother died. After that, I went to live with my father again. He kept beating me regularly. I was expected to take care of my little brother and sisters; the youngest one was only four months old when my mother left. I have never been to school, although I wanted to. One night a man came in to our home asking to take me away. He was armed and threatened my father who did not accept what he was asking for. Then my father called the police, and then the man left because he was afraid of the police. In the meantime, I met a guy and fell in love with him. I felt he was in love with me, but my family never accepted this fact, so they found me another man to marry. I had never met him before. My mother and my aunt decided on this. This marriage was not legal at all, because I was only fourteen; that’s what I learned later on. My father went illegally to Greece, and I went to live with my so-called husband and his brothers. This lasted only three weeks because he began to beat me regularly. After this, a neighbor of mine promised to go and find a job in Italy for me. He also proposed to me and asked me to marry him. I accepted and ran away secretly from home, hiding with him in the same city where I was born. There was a Russian girl hiding in this house as well. I was not comfortable with this new situation but I had no other way, so I just stayed and waited for things to happen. One Albanian boy called brought us to Vlora and then illegally from Vlora to Italy by speedboat. We slept one night in a house that belonged to a friend of the boy and the very next day they took us to a city in Italy. We stayed there in another house where there was a woman who used to teach us how to work in the streets. At the beginning I refused to do this type of work, but I was beaten all day and night. They threatened to kill me as well. So I was obliged to work as a prostitute. I worked in the streets for about three weeks. I was forced to give all the money I earned to the Albanian boy. After three weeks the police caught me, and I denounced him. The police guys took me to a center for minors. I stayed there for about a year and a half. During this time, I tried to contact my mother because I wanted to live with her and my other brothers and sisters. I found out that my mother took them from Albania to Italy. I went to see where and how she was living. I found out in the meantime that she was living with a man, a guy younger than she is, and working as a prostitute herself. I then told all my doubts and fears to the social workers in the center where I was sheltered and decided not to live with her. I miss her and love her so much, but I cannot accept the way she earns the money. Then I contacted my aunt in Albania and told her that I might want to come back to my country of origin and live with her. I returned from Italy and am trying to start a new life here.","Born in Albania, Odeta was trafficked into Italy, where trafficking victims also arrive from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, China, and South America. One NGO estimates that 48 percent of the prostitutes in Italy are from Eastern Europe. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply. "
Olga,2000 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Russia (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Israel (slavery location),"My name is Olga. I am from Siberia in Russia. In December of 1998, a female acquaintance of mine returned from a trip to Israel with a lot of money. She told me that she had worked as a housemaid, in shops and in bars, and that I could go and find a job, too. I asked her, how could she do this work without knowing the language? She told me that there were many Russian immigrants in Israel who wanted to hire Russian women so their children would not forget their heritage and original language. I had no money for a ticket to Israel, but the woman said: “Don’t worry, I’ll buy your ticket. You’ll make so much money that you’ll be able to pay me back in no time.” I decided to go, and got a visa to travel. She went on to Israel before me, telling me she would meet me at the airport. When I arrived, she was waiting with two big Israeli men. We went to a small city in Israel, where they showed me around, introducing me to many people but speaking in Hebrew so I could not understand. They told me they were people who might hire me. For a few days, it was as if I was a tourist just visiting. Then the men came back and told me that they had a job for me, but because I did not have a visa to work in Israel, I would have to give them my passport. A couple days later, they gave me a false passport, with my picture but the name of an Israeli woman. Then another Israeli man came, and my friend told me to put my things in his car, that he would take care of everything. He took me to Tel Aviv. He told me then that I had been sold to him for $10,000, and that I would have to pay him back. He told me I would have to prostitute myself. I was angry and disruptive, screaming and fighting every time he tried to take me from the apartment where I stayed. Because of this, he separated me from the other Russian women he owned. Every day I was taken to a brothel where all the other women were Israeli. I was still resistant, so I wasn’t making much money for my captor. He then told me that I had earned $8000 of my debt, and that he would find me another job to make the rest of it quickly. He promised I would not have to be a prostitute anymore. He took me to a hotel and told me to wait for my new employer. Two men came to meet me there. They gave me something to drink, which was drugged. I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was locked in a dark room with no furniture. I could hear people speaking Arabic but I could not understand them. I tried to escape, but the men there caught me quickly and again gave me some kind of drug to calm me. They told me just to sit down, that I had not been sold to them and that if I behaved well, everything would be okay. A Russian-speaking Arab told me that I had been kidnapped and was in Palestine. I began to fear that they would sell me to a harem in Iraq, or some place worse. The men there didn’t tell me what I was to do. I told them that I was Muslim, hoping that would give me some kind of protection. Several days later, they sold me back to another brothel in Israel. I told the brothel owners there that I would never work for them, so they locked me in an apartment and sent clients in anyway. If I refused to work, they would not feed me. They beat me, but only across the back near my kidneys, so it would not hurt my appearance. It was very painful. I saw only clients who spoke no Russian, so I couldn’t tell them my story. I saw 15-20 customers a day and the brothel owners gave me drugs so that I would work. I began to feel crazy and sick, so he gave me some kind of pills, which he told me were for headaches. I found out later that it was Ecstasy, a drug that makes you relax, and more willing to be intimate. After three weeks, I was dependent on the pills and asked for it every day. I began to try and learn some Hebrew from my clients, so I could explain what had happened to me. Those customers never came back. But finally I told a Polish Jew, who contacted the police. The brothel was raided in May of 1999, and I was deported back to Russia. ","Olga was lured to Israel from Russia by a female acquaintance in 1998. After socialism was dismantled in the USSR in 1991, “transition countries”—nations that moved from socialism to capitalism—saw an explosion in the export of men, women and children as slaves. The US government believes that as many as 100,000 women are trafficked throughout the 15 former Soviet countries annually and sold into international prostitution. Russian women are trafficked to over 50 countries for commercial sexual exploitation, including countries in Central and Western Europe and the Middle East. In Israel, where Olga was trafficked into sex slavery, women are trafficked from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, and Belarus. NGOs estimate that in 2005 between 1000 and 3000 women were trafficked into Israel for sexual servitude. Olga’s narrative recounts the experience of forced drug addition. This is one of several control mechanisms used by traffickers, along with intimidation and threats, violence, torture and rape, starvation, blackmail, debt bondage, and social isolation. Another control mechanism is identity control: victims of sex trafficking are often given new names and appearances to demonstrate that the traffickers not only own them but have created a new person for sexual exploitation. Olga’s narrative includes details of this particular control mechanism, describing the loss of her name. One final moment of identity loss then comes toward the end of her narrative, with her pretence of being Muslim in order to seek protection."
Pot,1995 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Thailand (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Japan (slavery location),"A friend I knew from the market in Nakhon Sawan told me about the opportunity to work in factories in Japan. I had divorced my Thai husband when I was four months pregnant and now my son was three years old and I had to raise him by myself and was finding it difficult to make enough money. My parents asked me not to go, but I thought if I went for just one year I could make money for my family and son. I didn’t realize what kind of work I was going to do until I was on my way to Japan, and I didn’t realize I was in debt for 380 bai [$30,000] until I arrived at the snack bar. I was told by the recruiters in Thailand that I would work in a factory and would get 50 percent of my salary until my debt was paid off. I was angry and freaked out about my situation. I was surprised to be locked up because I was not allowed any chance to say goodbye to my family, even over the phone. I heard the agents talking about the price for each woman being between 150-160 bai [$10,000-11,000] but I couldn’t really understand what they were talking about and did not realize that we were being sold into prostitution. I was feeling suspicious but still wasn’t clear about what was going on. In hindsight I believe that the immigration officer at Don Muang airport in Bangkok knew what I was going to do in Japan better than I did at the time, as the officer was buddy-buddy with my escort and just kept smiling at me and the other Thai women as he stamped our passports. Most of the women were under 20 years old and from the north of Thailand. All 50 women were guarded, controlled, and watched by the men at all times. I knew that there was something wrong and began talking to the other Thai women there. This is where I learned that all of the women were going to work in prostitution, because some of the women had worked in prostitution before and knew that they were going to do so in Japan. I didn’t know what to do. I just thought that once I got to Japan I would change my job immediately. Chan was trying to sell me and the others like cattle. Then, on the fifth day, a Thai woman bought me and took me to another woman named Chan in Ibaraki prefecture who paid 380 bai for me. I had known since Korea that I was being sold as a prostitute, but I didn’t realize until I got to the snack that this 380 bai that I was bought for was to be my debt. In all, I worked for eight months to pay back my debt and I had calculated that I must have paid it back long ago, but the mama kept lying to me and said she didn’t have the same records as I did. During these eight months, I had to take every client that wanted me and had to work everyday, even during my menstruation. The mama also made me and the other women work for her during the day and wouldn’t allow us to eat much saying we would get too fat. I was like a skeleton during that time. While I was under contract the mama paid for everything except for my health care and birth control pills. This was all added to my debt. I tried to keep track of my own records quietly, but I didn’t know all the additional expenses that the mama was adding to my debt. And I did not want the mama to know I was keeping track for fear that she would get angry. I did not have any money to send home unless a client gave me a good tip. I just wanted to pay off my debt and get enough money to go home. But the mama was always swearing at me for saving money. The mama threatened me, saying that if I made any trouble she’d sell me again and double my debt. During the first three months I was never allowed out of the apartment except with the mama or a client. Even after three months I was allowed out only along with others and was warned not to make any friends. Once a Yakuza member took me out for the night. He brought me to a hotel room and first injected himself with heroin and then tried to force me to inject. I refused and struggled. He beat me until I was almost dead. Then he took a rubber band out and strapped it around my arm and was just about to inject me when he passed out. I tried to move and after some time was able to get out of the hotel and fled back to my apartment. I didn’t dare tell anybody what happened or seek medical help for my injuries. When the Japanese police came around I knew that I had overstayed my visa and that the mama had my passport. I never dared to run away or even considered running to the police without my documents. Without my documents I was sure I would be arrested and jailed. I tried to be cooperative with the mama and not make any troubles for myself.","Pot was introduced to an agent in Bangkok in 1990 at the age of 27, and was flown to Tokyo via South Korea.

Puspal,2016 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"My husband had been working in kilns for five years and didn’t seem to be earning any money. In the kiln the work finishes only when it finishes, it is endless. We do not stop even if we are ill because we fear – what if our debt is increasing? So we don’t dare to stop. We are kept in the dark about how much we are owed. Whenever we asked, the debt was still not paid. My husband, Raju, was asked to bring more families back from Chhattisgarh. He was told that he would get a commission and that we would have less debt to pay off. We mortgaged whatever we had at home, including my jewellery, so that we could go and bring more families. However, when we got back to the kiln with the families, the new workers were not paid any of the allowance they had been promised and were starving. They tried to leave, but two got caught. They locked them up and started beating them. They told the workers, ‘if you want to go from here, you must pay 60,000, that is your debt’. Raju found the number for VSJ (Volunteers for Social Justice) and went to ask for help. He was away for fifteen days. I was alone with the children at the brick kiln and the owner got very suspicious. He searched for Raju, demanding to know where he was. At this time I was pregnant and fell very ill. I called VSJ, feeling desperate, and they sent someone to the kiln to take me to hospital, where I was treated and also had the baby. After I had the child, we all came to the project’s temporary rehabilitation centre, and Raju now works for VSJ. As a woman I do not feel safe. I fear for my children. What if they become like us, without a house, without food, always desperate. ","Puspal was a bonded labourer in a brick kiln in India. Entire families migrate every year from other states in India to find work in Punjab’s brick kilns. The survey data suggest that there are more than 18 million people or 1.4 percent of the total population, who are living in conditions of modern slavery in India. Industries implicated in survey data include domestic work, the construction and sex industries, agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, manual labour, and forced begging. Most of India’s slavery problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata—lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups—are most vulnerable."
Putri,2005 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Indonesia (trafficked from),Malaysia (slavery location),"I’m from Wonosobo and I worked in Selangor. Initially I had a good relationship with my employer, but then after a week I was going to be dumped on the street. I had refused to be sent back and insisted that I continue working for two years as agreed initially, but my employer refused. Then they were going to kill me, throw me from the 11th floor. The problem first started when I was bathing their dog, but the dog did not want to be bathed. And then I had been hanging out the wash, and some fell on the floor, and that was the problem. The wash was on the apartment balcony, and it fell down. We left it to go shopping, and when I came back the clothes were already on the ground, I don’t know why they fell, maybe because the wind, I don’t know. Maybe they just fell by themselves. That’s it. The agent was called in by my Madam. She told the agent that I was not working properly. The agent told me to get a mop, and my employer told me to get the clothes that fell down the balcony, but I first went to get the mop, and that was wrong. That’s it. I was going to be pushed off the balcony. I was pushed, but then two persons suddenly came and pulled me. If I had fallen I would already be dead now (laughs a little). The two were my employer’s two older siblings who were visiting, from China. There were railings on balcony, and my leg was stuck between the railings and I couldn’t pull it out, I was stuck. I was very scared, afraid that I was going to die. And it hurt where my leg was stuck, like it was going to pop off. I was very scared. Afraid that I’d die, really. I thought they were good people. I didn’t think that they would do that. And before that, every time they take me to go outside, I was not allowed to get back into the car, I was always going to be dumped. Dumped on the street, and not allowed to return home. Yes, they wanted to dump me, not allow me to go back. They told me to walk, to get off the car. I was not allowed to return home with them. The deliberately wanted to dump me. But I held on to the car. They insisted that I stay where I am and not go home with them. But I refused, and said that if they don’t want me to work, then they must return me to Indonesia. That’s what I asked them to do. If they don’t want to send me back to Indonesia, I wanted to be taken to the embassy. But they refused. I was returned to the agent. The agent hit me, so one eye doesn’t see very well. I was hit until I was bleeding. He hit me with his bare hand but he was wearing a ring, and the ring punctured my skin. Then I had another employer. I was told that I will be taking care of an elderly person. But I was raped by my male employer. I was raped while I was unconscious. Maybe I was drugged or something, I don’t know. After I was raped, he made promises. He said that he will give me money amounting to the total of my salary for four years. And then he said he give my passport and buy me a ticket, return me to my home. But in fact, a little later in the afternoon I was collected by my agent. None of the promises were met. I was deceived.    ","Putri is an Indonesian woman who was enslaved in Malaysia as a domestic servant for multiple employers. Foreign workers constitute more than 20 percent of the Malaysian workforce and typically migrate voluntarily—often illegally—to Malaysia from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries, often in pursuit of better economic opportunities. However, workers can find themselves imprisoned, exploited, and in debt bondage. The law allows many of the fees of migration, which are first paid by employers, to be deducted from workers’ wages, incentivising employers to prevent workers from ending their employment before fees are recovered.

Ragaa,1997 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Egypt (trafficked from),Egypt (slavery location),"In 1995, there were no job opportunities, so I worked on commission selling goods in the street markets for a man named Mr. Asam Abass Mohamed. I had been working for only five days with some other people, when on the sixth day Mr. Mohamed ordered me to stay and guard the goods while everybody else went out. He then offered me some juice with breakfast. I drank it, and afterward lost consciousness. When I awoke, I had been raped and was locked in a hotel room. I didn’t know where I was. Then some strange people came and took me to a train station. They took me to a small village called Nga Wansy, in the Aswan governorate in southern Egypt. There they threatened me, locked me up and beat me, until I became very ill. They tried to rape me in spite of my sickness. When I protested, they offered me a pleasure marriage but I refused. They locked me up again for a long time, leaving me alone in my room. They told me that if I tried to go back to my family, my parents would blame me and kill me for running away. They moved me all across the country to different places, torturing me and trying to have sex with me. In the town of Adko in Bihera governorate, the people who were keeping me tried to force me to accept other temporary marriages. I refused again. By chance, my family—my mother, my sister and her husband—found me in a city near Zakazik. They helped me to escape and I went to my father’s house, where I stay now. I am living in terror of those people who kept me for so long. The police refuse to protect me. ","Egypt is a transit country for women trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union to Europe and Israel for sexual exploitation. Internal trafficking occurs as well: Ragaa is an Egyptian woman trafficked into sex slavery within Egypt in 1995, and children are trafficked from rural areas to work as laborers in the agriculture industry. Each year over one million children between the ages of seven and 12 work 11 hours a day for Egypt’s agricultural cooperatives on cotton pest management. They face routine beatings by their foremen, and exposure to heat and pesticides.Ragaa’s experience included the offer of a “pleasure marriage,” which is a temporary arrangement to permit sexual intercourse, and a “temporary marriage,” because brothels are forbidden by law and Islamic Sharia in Egypt. Then she explains that her escape brought no sense that the experience was over. The problem of freedom after bondage was an ongoing fear of her traffickers."
Rini,2007 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Indonesia (trafficked from),Indonesia (slavery location),"My name is Rini. I was born in Magetan on 8th May 1987. When I was small I went to kindergarten school, and then I went to primary school at Sidomulyo village. Then I went to junior high in the Public Junior High School SLTP 2 Panekahan. I stayed home for a while and then I started working. When I was 16, someone was looking for a domestic helper from Magetan, so I went along. I started to work as a domestic helper in Jakarta. I worked for a year and four months. The employer was kind. She often took me along with her outside. On holidays I get time off—I went home during the Lebaran [Muslim festival]. She let me go home during the Lebaran and my salary was given when Lebaran came. And they took me to the Safari Zoo. After that I worked in Surabaya as a domestic helper for two years. She was a good employer, paid my salary. If I wanted to go out, I just asked permission. But I wanted to go back to Jakarta and so I started to work as a domestic helper in Jatinegara, Jakarta. I must wash clothes, do the cleaning, sweep and mop the floors. At first the employer was good. She took me outside two times, first she took me to a wedding reception, and the second time she took me to a mall. She had four children. They were good. The eldest is in sixth grade, the smallest is in second grade. But it started to change at the end of December 2006, after seven months. Sometimes when I make a mistake mopping the floor, if I don’t sweep cleanly enough, when I don’t do the cleaning quickly enough, if I don’t work fast enough, it make my employer angry. At first she only used words. And then eventually she started hitting. She often hit me, every few days. She beat me usually when I make mistakes, not work fast enough, not clean enough. Sometimes she only uses her hands, sometimes she used an object, sometimes with a broomstick. I was strangled too. The husband never hit me. When she hit me, sometimes he did nothing. Sometimes he would reprimand his wife. But then they would fight with each other. Sometimes she didn’t give me food for a whole day. And then the next she would give me food. So sometimes I would only eat once every two days. She accused me of often stealing biscuits and she beat me, on every part of my body. I never stole them. I really did nothing wrong. But I couldn’t run, I couldn’t get out. I was forced to stay there. I was not allowed to go. And I was never paid any salary and my parents also never received any of my salary. One day another worker in the house fell down the stairs. She was unconscious but my employer was still abusing her. I felt sorry for her. She’s already passed out, yet they still kept beating her. She stepped on her, grabbed her hair, banged her head, splashed her with water. They took her to the hospital. I stayed at home. And then at the hospital my friend died. I think when the doctor examined her at the hospital she was already dead. When she died my friend had a lot of bruises on her body, so the doctor was suspicious. And then shortly afterwards my female employer was detained at the Polsek, with the police. My male employer picked up me up at the house and took me to someone else’s house. He told me to spend the night there and tomorrow morning he will pick me up. Then I was taken to the police station and the police took me to the hospital. I feel happier, happier than I was yesterday. I am getting healthier day by day. My father came here one day after I was admitted to the hospital, then my mother.","Rini is an Indonesian woman who was a domestic slave in Indonesia, where she was confined to the house, verbally and physically abused, and her salary withheld. She was only able to escape from the situation when one of the other workers in the house died of injuries from the abuse. The government has taken some positive steps towards protecting domestic workers. Following pressure from local and international organisations, including Walk Free, the Indonesian House of Representatives recommended the Domestic Workers Protection Bill for its list of priority legislation in 2016. Rini was enslaved without leaving Indonesia, but significant numbers of Indonesians are exploited in forced labor and debt bondage abroad in Asia and the Middle East, primarily in domestic service, factories, construction, and manufacturing, on Malaysian palm oil plantations, and on fishing vessels throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans."
Rita,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My home in the hills is in Gorkha. My father died when I was two years old. After that my mother kept me at my aunt’s place and got married again. I was fine at my aunt’s place. A foreigner sent money for my education. I was studying in a government school at the beginning. Later I was admitted into an English school in class eight. I had difficulty adjusting, and failed. My sponsor stopped sending money. I discontinued my studies because of financial hardship. A few months later my uncle remarried. I went back to my mother because it was very difficult staying there. I thought of looking for a job and I told the neighborhood elders that I was interested in working if I could get a job. Then one man arranged a job for me in a hotel. There in the hotel I got acquainted with a friend. We came to know each other because she was a dancer and I a waitress…Some months later my friend said: “Look, how long am I going to be dancer in this dance restaurant and how long are you going to be a waitress here? Let us look for some other work or business.” I was attracted by the idea because of the greed to earn more and because of poverty. Then I asked my friend what kind of business she was talking about. She said she knew some young men. My friend said they were really good people and that they dealt in diamonds. Two days later two men came and my friend introduced me to them, saying these were “the brothers.” The friend said that these brothers would give us diamonds and we had to carry them to India. I asked the brothers why they needed to take us girls. Because men wouldn’t go, they said. They said they had to take girls because girls were not checked as thoroughly as men. Mainly because I trusted my friend and because she said the men were really good and she knew them well, I agreed. So I said “Fine!” We went to Manakamana, before going to India. After performing prayers we came and sat down to have tea. While waiting for something to eat they gave us soda. We never thought about what might happen to us, whether those men could be trusted, and after drinking it, we felt very sleepy and sick. I remember getting into a truck. After that, where they took us, what they did…I don’t know anything. We were taken to a very quiet place through some internal routes. After crossing into India they kept us in a hotel. Then the main man took us to a big house. We hadn’t even climbed the stairs and there was a fat woman sitting there. They said she was the owner. We greeted her and they took us into a room and kept us there. Then the main man said they were going to get money and we were to stay there. I was a bit frightened and held onto the hand of one of the boys. I asked him why we were being kept in the room like this and what was really happening. “It’s nothing,” he said, “you two shouldn’t panic. Stay calm here, the brothers will come back with the money and then we can all return to Kathmandu.” And so we stayed inside. In the adjoining room we heard a boy and a girl talking. There was a place from where one could peek in, and so I looked and said to that boy: “There is a boy and a girl in there. What’s going on in this hotel?” “It’s nothing, this is a hotel and these things happen,” the boy said. And after that, all of a sudden I suspected that we are being sold and I asked the boy. It wasn’t like that and I shouldn’t worry, he said. Shortly after that, the fat woman came. She told the two of us to wait in the room and left with the boy. “The brothers are going to come back with money,” she said, and locked us from the outside. And we kept on sitting there. We felt like crying, for this had never happened to us before. Then around evening, they sent us off to freshen up and have a bath saying: “You must be tired.” Then they took us to another room and said: “Wait here, the brothers will come.” A woman entered at one o’clock in the morning. “The brothers have come, let’s go,” she said. We were so happy then. But the woman said: “The two of you shouldn’t go together, you must go one at a time else the police will suspect.” She left my friend there and took me alone to another house. I asked her where the brothers were. She said: “They will never come back again. They have sold you and left.” I felt as if I had fallen off a cliff. I just couldn’t believe it. I collapsed when that woman said I had been sold. I still find it difficult to talk about this matter. And I found it extremely difficult at that time. All I could think of was: what am I to do and how do I escape? I had no interest in the food they served. There were many Nepali girls, sisters, in another big room. On the other side, some were watching a movie, some were sleeping. I was kept in a separate room. Then they snatched my citizenship papers. I had gone wearing a T-shirt and trousers and I was asked to remove them. They made me wear a long skirt. I was trying to run away. There was only netting on the window, no windowpanes. At times like that one seems to gain strength. I had managed to take out half the netting after locking the room from inside. Somebody knocked and asked who was inside. “I am here, didi,I am here didi, I am going to sleep here. I don’t like sleeping outside, I will sleep here,” I said. I was frightened. “Come outside fast, my customer has come,” she said. After that I had to open the door. They realized I was trying to run away. Two, three of them beat me very badly, all were women. And the Madam to whom the boys had sold me first, sold me to a second Madam the next day. She beat me with this big stick. I was beaten until that stick broke. My condition was really bad. They banged my head on the wall. I can’t tell you now how I felt then. I told them: “I won’t do such work. Please, let me go from here.” I pleaded with them. They told me people who come here can never return. They said: “you work hard, and if you work well we will send you back in two years.” I didn’t even eat for two or three days. I suffered a lot, and was forced by circumstances to do that work. Once you come to a house like that, you can forget about not wanting to do bad things. They tell you what to do. They force us, when the man is sent for the first time. In the beginning a Muslim man came and told me to go with him. And I went. I felt like crying, and I cried. He asked me why I was crying, what had happened. And I had to talk, though it was frightening. I told him how I was sold. I told him to take me away from there: “I want to go, and don’t want to work like this.” I spoke to him like that. Some men are gentlemen. I told the first man everything. He said: “you are a beginner, you are new. Since somebody has sold you I will not do this to you.” The man who came some days later did it. When I didn’t agree he went to tell the Madam and I was frightened. He asked me to remove my clothes and I removed them. If I didn’t agree I would be beaten. Whether we could or not, whether it was painful or not, we had to do it. And if we complained of pain they would give us medicine. You sit all by yourself. They put on the television, and if a customer comes we have to go with the customer. We are sitting there and they say: “Let’s go.” Inside, there are rooms. There were 13 small rooms in that place. A big room is partitioned into smaller rooms…girls are made up and kept here. They also provide cosmetics. The boys come themselves, it’s not like other places where old women sit and call, not like that. The customers come and if they like, they take the girls. When a man comes there once, he tells his friends about it. That friend comes, and he tells his friend. Like this, the number of customers increases. I stayed there for about four months. Customers do not like old workers, and there are many customers when new recruits arrive. I had to service 20-30 customers in a day. A customer is charged 75 rupees [$1.5] during the day, and it takes about five minutes, ten minutes. The Madams tells us not give too much time to men who pay 75. But if the person books for three, four hours, then you have to stay for three, four hours. If I have five, six customers, I have to service them one by one. They wait. We don’t get a single paisa [0.1 rupee]. It is very difficult. Customers come even when we are sleeping. We had to service customers from five o’clock till one o’clock in the morning. I can’t describe how we felt...It was very painful for me down there but when I couldn’t service customers, they would ask for the reason. If they found out about my pain, they would immediately take me for injections. Everybody used to go. And for new girls, on the way we used to be accompanied by two people—one on each side. They used to do that to me. We never knew anything about HIV/AIDS. We knew that we could get pregnant having sex without a condom. We didn’t know about other things…I asked two, three friends of mine what happens to girls with AIDS. “They are not kept here,” they said. “They are sent home.” And if somebody gets pregnant after having been careless, they will keep that girl also, the mother in one place and the child in another. Or they make them abort the baby. If the girls don’t say anything even after conception, signs of pregnancy show up after three, four months. When abortion becomes difficult they are allowed to deliver the baby. They pretend to love us because we bring them money. The more customers serviced the more money earned. They coaxed me to work when I was new, by pretending to love me. We were coaxed all the time. “We were also sold like you,” they used to say. “We are doing this kind of work because we were not able to return to Nepal. You shouldn’t have come but you have; now do your work well, pay back the money, then if you feel like going home you can go. If you don’t want to go, you stay back here. If you insist on going back you will be sent back in two years time.” But from top to bottom, there wasn’t a place where I was not beaten. I had blue marks all over my body. And after a beating we were forbidden to tell the customer. If they asked, we have to say we fell down the stairs. There was an ointment available to remove the marks, and they would themselves apply that ointment on me. Two or three days after the application of medicine the marks would disappear. The windows and doors there have steel grills. The windows have grills. There is one door to come in and go out of and male guards on both sides. The Madam sits outside 24 hours a day. The old girls are sitting outside 24 hours. Twenty-four hours, the guards are sitting outside. There is absolutely no chance of getting out. When they were first taking me to give me an injection I tried to escape on the way. But when you try to escape, no matter from which direction you go, you are still in the same place. It looks the same. After that I thought: even if I run away from this place I will probably reach the same type of place. So I didn’t run away. Suppose somebody is kept in a tank full of water—how suffocating it would be. Just like that, I also felt absolutely suffocated and longed to escape from there. You couldn’t speak to anyone, couldn’t make friends with anyone. There was this younger sister, Maili, in the place I was staying. Poor thing, she didn’t have customers coming to her. She was abused verbally, and she tried to run away one day. That time I was sick and sleeping. She tried to run away, and succeeded, too. But she was caught and brought back by the people who bring the tea. A person went to grind salt and chili. The paste was applied to the girl’s genitals. That girl was beaten so badly. I was sleeping. She was beaten black and blue all over the body and hands, and on top of that chili was put inside her. The Madam told everyone not to give her water even if she asked for it. That poor girl got up, crying, and came to me. She asked me what to do and said: “This is what they have done to me.” There was talk going around about selling her to another place. Three months after that one Indian man came. I had asked many men who came there to help me get out. “I want to get away from here,” I had said. Most of the men were too frightened to help me get out of there. It was a very dangerous place. There were thugs and if anybody came to help girls escape, they would kill the helpers. That’s the kind of place it was. But I told him everything. He said he would help me and asked me for my home address. After that he went to Maiti Nepal, which has an office in Bombay. And they came to get us out. There are so many other sisters in the place where I was sold. I told them we shouldn’t stay there. “Let’s go! We will go to Nepal instead. We shouldn’t do this kind of work, let’s go,” I begged. The newcomers agreed to come, but the girls who had been there for 15-16 years didn’t want to come. When the police arrived I begged them to leave the place. “Let’s go, let’s not stay here,” I said. But they said they wouldn’t go. “What will we get if we go to Nepal? We’ll get nothing but misery. We’ve been sold like this, we’ve become prostitutes. We will not be accepted by society. We won’t go,” they said. “Even if we go, we will go only with money.” And even the policemen who came to raid said they will take only those who wish to go. Vidhya, the friend who had gone with me from Kathmandu, was in another house. I told them that my friend was in that house and to go get her too. But they couldn’t find my friend. The Madam found out the police was coming and hid her elsewhere. When they have information about the arrival of police, the girls are immediately shifted to another place. In the beginning I was shifted to another house when the police came. And later I was hidden in the interiors inside the cupboard on the wall. When it’s time for the police to come we are hidden deep inside as if we are buried in the earth. They have made such places to hide the girls. Somehow they get information even before the police arrive. They don’t call the police “police” but call them “uncle”…I think the police of the lower ranks provide information. That’s how it was with them. We would be hidden inside, and the police would go back with nothing. Vidhya was left behind. I still feel sad thinking about her. I couldn’t help set her free. They didn’t find her. And I found out from other friends later that she was sold to some other place. If they find that someone is trying to run away then that’s what they do, it seems. We were harassed by lawyers and police after we come back to Nepal. The way they question—it is like scratching a wound. They question us as if we went knowingly. “They have done this willingly,” that’s what they think. We have come back from that sort of place with all the pain and suffering, and even then we have to file a complaint with the police. The men there question us and ask: “How many did you sleep with?” After I came back from there, when I went to the Jawalakhel police station and a man was writing down the complaint, there were many boys and other men present. Those policemen should have thought about how awkward it would be for this girl, being questioned like that in the presence of everyone, but they don’t. Forget about giving us justice—instead, in front of everyone they ask us questions. They shame us in public. It’s more painful because of this. I had suffered as much as I could take. But thanks to the support of Maiti Nepal we were able to come here to Kathmandu. I work as a counselor. Those who have been sold and have returned are suffering lots of pain and grief. They aren’t able to tell others or share this with anybody. We go to them and talk to them, hoping to lessen their grief, and we give them advice. People may detest me, but I always wished to return to Nepal. That wish of mine has been fulfilled. When I arrived at Maiti Nepal the brothers and sisters here gave me encouragement. I had come to totally detest Nepalis because I was taken to India and sold by a Nepali. After coming back from there I used to get angry just looking at Nepali people. But there is training at Maiti Nepal for up to six months. As one by one the days passed by, I felt like making friends. After that, slowly, I got used to it. Or, after coming out of that place in India I used to be afraid of talking to important people at first. Now I am not frightened to talk. I wasn’t able to study earlier, now what I feel is that since I can read a little, now I wish to do something in life. And my pain, my past, if somebody understands, if he is willing to accept me even after knowing everything, I will get married. This happened to me because I trusted my good friend. To say that only the uneducated are sold is wrong. Because even many educated ones are being sold. There are many educated girls, too; they are coaxed, misled and taken. Many are taken away with the promise of marriage and later sold. We were made “sisters” and taken. From very young I never got my own mother’s affection, nor a father’s love. If anyone had given me a little bit of affection probably I, too, might have become something. That’s how I feel. Even at Auntie’s I couldn’t get much affection, couldn’t get a mother’s love, either—forget about getting that of a father. Since I was very young, I was running about in search of affection. I wished somebody would give me a little love. I went trusting a friend, and it’s turned out like this now. You have to try and compare yourself with others. I consider myself lucky. The way others have contracted HIV has not happened to me. I was able to come back fast. That is what makes me very happy. But I don’t like to remember the days I spent there. I want to forget the things that happened.","Rita was drugged and trafficked from Nepal into India in 1998 at the age of 19. She was eventually helped by the NGO “Maiti Nepal.” Here she narrates a series of experiences that are rooted in her identity as a woman. The traffickers tricked her by explaining that they needed her to help smuggle diamonds—because “girls were not checked as thoroughly as men” by border guards. One of the first incidents in India is the replacement of her trousers for a long skirt. She notes that when women are enslaved they are “made ‘sisters.’” She goes on to observe the psychology of women who refuse to leave because they “will not be accepted by society.” She describes the horror of public questioning about her experiences in sex slavery. And she tells the stories of two other women—Vidhya and Maili. Thousands of Nepali women and children are trafficked every year across the border into Indian brothels, and Nepal has an unknown number of internal sex trafficking victims as well. In response to a dowry practice, where they must offer gifts that could be worth several years’ income, some parents sell their daughters rather than have them married. Other women are drugged and taken across the border, like Rita. Once enslaved, Nepali girls and women are more likely to be arrested than rescued by the police, and most Nepalese victims never leave India, even after liberation. Those who do are often shunned by their families and remain in Kathmandu at shelters. Another aspect of this enslavement is HIV and AIDS. Some 50 percent of those who return to Nepal are HIV-positive, and Rita makes reference to these “girls with AIDS.”"
Ros,2007 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Indonesia (trafficked from),Indonesia (slavery location),"I am from Nusa Tenggara Timur, Waengapo, East Sumba. I was born in 1985, on 14th May. I was raised by my father and mother. When I was five years old I entered first grade. After first grade, I did not go into the third, fourth, and fifth grade, but immediately jumped to sixth grade from the second grade. I then entered seventh grade when I was eight years old. After graduating from ninth grade, I entered high school. After high school, I refused to go to college, I wanted to work immediately. I had a friend who asked me to go along with her to Jakarta. She was already working in a hospital. She asked me to work at the Sumber Waras hospital, in Grogol. I was not able to work there at that time because I haven’t validated my high school diploma. My friend told me to work as a cleaning service staff. I did not want to become a cleaning staff. I wanted to do a nursing related job. So she told me if I don’t want to, then I should validate my diploma. But my father did not let me go to Jakarta. I ran away from home. I ran away from home and upon arriving in Jakarta I headed to a church in Kelapa Gading. There I met with Doctor Suryajaya. He asked where I was working. I answered that I am not currently working, and that I am still looking for work. He asked me what kind of job I wanted have, and I told him that I wanted to work in a hospital. He then said that he owns a clinic, but that it was a private clinic, not government owned, a beauty clinic. I said I am willing to do that kind of work at a place like that. In the morning I applied for work at the Kresiya clinic. I was accepted and subsequently worked there for two years. At Kresiya I do facial cleansing, as it is a beauty clinic, a skincare clinic. I was assigned to cleanse faces, pluck eyebrows. It was like a beauty salon. I had been renting board, a room, near the clinic. One afternoon, after returning from work at the clinic, a man called Arifin was at the front of the boarding house. He stood there and asked me, “what bus should I take if I want to go to Daan Mogot?” I told him that I don’t know. He then stood there for a long time. After about half an hour standing there, he asked if he can have some drinking water. I gave him some water. I thought he was a good man, so I gave him water. I gave him water, and then he asked for my cell phone number, which I gave to him. He then asked where I worked. I told him that I worked at the Kresiya clinic. “How much do you make a month?” “I make one million a month.” “How much do you pay for monthly rent?” “375 thousand rupiah.” At that time I only paid 375 thousand for my board, which is cheap.  “If you were working for me, you would not have to pay rent. Would you like to be my assistant?” I asked, “What kind of company do you own?” He said that he runs a domestic helper agency in Tanjung Pinang. I said, “if you can offer me a salary more than one million, I would accept your offer.” He offered me a net salary of 1.8 million rupiah, and all my needs including meals he will provide and I will be staying at his house. So I accepted, I went along with him under the promise of a 1.8 million rupiah salary. On May 23, 2003 I went with Arifin to Tanjung Pinang. Upon arriving, I worked as his assistant for nine months, from May 2003 until February 2004. I worked as his assistant without pay. I asked him why I was not being paid, and said that I come here looking for work. “I did not come here to just sit around like this. I need money. You offered me a job and said you are willing to pay me, so I took you up on your offer.” He answered, “I will pay you your salary later. I am currently keeping it in the bank.” I said that I don’t want my money to be kept in the bank, I want to be given my money now. He told me that he liked me. I asked him if he has a wife or not. He said no. In Tanjung Pinang he has two homes, one in Pramuka Street and the other in Sutami Street. I stayed at the house at Sutami. His wife stayed in Pramuka. So at that time I did not know he already had a wife. After nine months I began asking about my salary, and he got mad and hit me. He always hit me using a knife and I always cried afterwards. After that I tried to escape. I ran and when I got to the port, I was caught by a Navy personnel who was a friend of his, who was under his payroll. I was taken back to the house. I was then locked up in a room, not allowed to go out and be his assistant anymore. For four years while being locked up in that room I only lived by eating boiled eggs. Even when he was in the house I was locked up. When he goes, I am locked up. The door had four padlocks and he kept them locked, I was not allowed to go outside at all. When he is around and I go into his office, he held me as if I am a thief and should be kept close to him. When he goes to take a shower, I am put back in my room. He has three wives. The first wife is in Tanjung Pinang at Pramuka Street. The second is in Batam, at Batam Center. The third wife is at Daan Mogot, who owns the Setia Karya Mandiri foundation, in Jakarta. I was his mistress in Tanjung Pinang. When he goes to visit his wives, he locked me up in my room and I only lived on boiled eggs. Only one egg per day, I was not allowed to have two or three, and only one glass of tea per day. One day I said I want to go outside, but he won’t let me go outside, saying that I would try to run away. I was constantly being beaten in my room, treaded on. Then I got pregnant. Entering the second month of my pregnancy, I was given a Japanese traditional herbal medicine. I miscarried. He lied to me, saying that the medicine is to strengthen the fetus. But in fact it was not to make the fetus stronger but killed it. He bought me birth control pills. Aside from the pills there were also pink colored pills this big and he told me to drink them. Every time after I took the pills I feel rather numb, like I am not alive anymore, as if this life is empty. That was how I felt. I continued to take the pills, and I didn’t get pregnant again. I was often beaten. And when I refused to have sex, my feet were once cut, and my back was stabbed with a knife by Arifin. Once I was trying to run to the bathroom, he grabbed my clothes and stabbed me with a knife. Afterwards I stopped taking the birth control pills and I got pregnant for the second time. I got sick, my stomach hurt and I couldn’t sleep. I vomited. I told him that I missed my period for the second month now. He said he will buy me medicine, but I always refused to drink it, I threw it away. Eventually I became ill, kept vomiting. I was taken to the Navy hospital. Upon arriving at the hospital I was examined by Dr. Hendrasto and Dr. Muhibah. They examined me and sad that I had appendicitis. I did not believe that I had appendicitis. I was angry and said that I do not have appendicitis. If I did, then I would not be able to bend my right leg. Finally the doctors reexamined me and said that I was pregnant and my fetus was growing outside the womb. Arifin said that I must be operated, insisted that the doctor perform a surgery. I was operated on March 3, 2007 at the navy hospital. Two days after my operation, I asked the doctor, what was it that I was operated for? I asked Arifin and he told me that I was operated for appendicitis, but I did not believe him. An appendicitis operation would be to the right side, not in the center. I asked the doctor, what kind of operation that I just had. The doctor cried and apologized and kneeled beside me. I was puzzled as to why the doctor was crying. The doctor said that my fetus was removed. I did not accept that, because I don’t want to not have any children. I still want to have children. I then told the doctor about being held captive for four years by Arifin. And the doctor advised me, when I get out of the hospital I can run away and head for the Mayor’s office. I took his advice. After reaching the house, just after getting out of the car, I ran to the Mayor’s office. After running to the Mayor’s office, the mayor called Arifin and told him to collect me because the Mayor was acquainted with Arifin, he was his good friend. I was then taken back to Arifin’s house. I asked to be taken to the Bunda apothecary, because the doctor has a practice there. My incision was not sutured using threads, but was held together using staples. But Arifin did not want to spend any money. He said that he will take out the staples by himself. I did not want him to do that because it will hurt. He then bought some alcohol and poured it on my stomach and he took out the staples using pliers. I then started to bleed and I cried. I did not want him to continue. He only got one out and I started to cry. My stomach then swelled at the location of the incision. I cried for two days and two nights, refusing to eat. I again asked to be taken to Bunda because Dr. Hendra and Dr. Muhibah have a practice there. In the evening I was taken to Bunda. At Bunda my staples were taken out by Dr. Hendra and Dr. Muhibah. We had to pay more than 200 thousand rupiah. After getting back to the house, Arifin beat me because he just had to spend 280 thousand rupiah for medicine and doctor’s fee for taking out the sutures. Just a short period after my operation he already wanted to have sex. It hurt, I cannot bear the pain. After that he went to Jakarta. After he returned from Jakarta, arriving at Tanjung Pinang, I was beaten because I did not send him any SMS message. I did not have any credit left on my cell phone card. Before he went off, he only recharged my cell phone card worth 10,000 rupiah. His daughter often send me SMS, his daughter from his first wife. She cares about me. She calls me Mama Ade. His eldest son defends me. When we were at the police station, he told her farther “You should not treat Mama Ade like that. Mama Ade loves us.” I never hated his children, I only hated Arifin. Even though his three wives hate me, I never hate children, because I know that these children have done nothing wrong. It was their father and mothers who hate me, so I only hated the adults. In fact, I take care of one of his children. His youngest daughter is named Diah. He has seven children here. In Jakarta. The smallest is Diah and I take care of her. So this girl is attached to me. I never bear hatred towards children. His children here are neglected, his wife doesn’t take care of them, so he brought this girl to Tanjung Pinang. I took care of her, until she gained weight. After she became healthy again, he took her back to Jakarta. She still calls me Mama Ade. But now that I have gone to the police, Arifin told his children to pretend that they do not know me. But his eldest son from his first wife, Joni, defended me when I was at the police station. He has four children from his first wife, and five children from his second wife in Batam. He has seven from his wife in Jakarta. One day when he came back from his wife, he forgot to lock the door. He wanted to take a bath quickly. He shouted from the bathroom to have his clothes ready, and I noticed that the door was open. I also saw that the security guard was not at his post. I then called this one servant who was always nice to me. Her name is Debi. “Deb, please help me. Get me a bag.” She wanted to get a bag from the back of the house, but I told her not to. “Just get me a worker’s bag and put my clothes in it, as I want to run away.” I told the servant to pack my clothes. I went into the bathroom, and he was still taking his bath, his flower bath. I quickly got out of the house. He then called out to me. He asked, “Is the room door still closed?” “Yes, you locked it.” “Where is the key?” I then pulled out the key from the door and gave it to him in the bathroom and I opened the door. He then told me to turn on the air conditioner and I turned it on. He shouted angrily for me to be quick with his clothes. I then took his money, 400 thousand rupiah, and gave it to the servant so that she keeps quiet. I told her, “if you tell Arifin that I ran away, he probably will cut you up, kill you.” But the servant was kind, she helped me with my bag. I called Dr. Hendra from the front room. I told him that I don’t want to run to the Mayor’s office. Where should I run to now? The doctor said he’ll call Dr. Lily. Before Dr. Hendra called Ms. Lily, Arifin caught me again. After he caught me again, I begged, and promised him that I would not try to run away again. I asked to be allowed to work. Arifin told me to kiss his feet and lick the soles of his feet, which I did for the sake of my survival. I was put to work at Gambir Street, caring for the elderly. I was not strong enough to carry elderly persons, my surgical scar was hurting, and it bled every time I tried to pick up an elderly person. My salary was taken by Arifin. One day after working there for one month, I went to the house at Sutami and Arifin beat me up. I hate him so much, I was angry. I called my friend in Jakarta. His name is Awin. He has a seat in the regional legislative in Batam. I knew him when I was in Jakarta, when I was still working at the clinic. Awin advised me that there was this women empowerment bureau, a women protection organization. I asked him for the number. I called Ms. Lily at two o’clock in the afternoon, and asked her to pick me up at Gambir. Ms. Lily was afraid that she’ll be caught by Arifin, and she was reluctant to pick me up. I was angry at her, “Do you want to help me or not?” So I pressed Ms. Lily to pick me up. She picked me up at Gambir. Before Ms. Lily arrived at Gambir, I had a fight with my boss who runs the retirement home. I fought with him so that I can get out quickly. “You must go home with your husband.” “No, I can get back to my house on my own. I am his wife, I don’t need to be picked up by him.” “Are you trying to escape?” asked my boss. “No, I’m not trying to run away, I’m going back to my husband’s house.” My boss then let me go. At 2 o’clock I was picked up by Ms. Lily and I was taken to the shelter. At the shelter, at five o’clock, I asked for an escort from the SBY Committee to pick up my friend at Arifin’s house. There is this female worker there who underwent surgery the same time that I did. Because she was never given medication or treatment of any kind, there was a hole on her body where she was operated on. Her intestines were visible. But I did not see her again, she was hidden. After I asked for an escort from the SBY Committee, they didn’t send anyone there until two days later. They were too late. I was visited by the Tanjung Pinang District Police Chief. And he advised me to make a report with the police and not be afraid. I told him that I was afraid because I know that Arifin has a lot of power. He can provide strong evidence, present fake witnesses. As it turned out, he did present fake witnesses. His witnesses were all his employees, including the servant who helped me try to escape. The servant actually did not want to testify against me, but she was afraid that she would be beaten or killed by Arifin, so now she sided with Arifin. His son, Joni, defended me. He said to his father “You must not treat Mama Ade like that. She is your wife. She was never bad to us.” Arifin hit his son, causing his mouth to bleed. But I told his son, “it’s okay, one day your father will get what’s coming to him.” I was interviewed by reporters. Arifin was also visited by reporters, at his house at Sutami. He turned the facts around. He claimed that he never knew me, he only knew me as his servant. I told them, “that that is what he claims. I’m sorry if I don’t have any evidence and no witnesses.” I admit that I cannot present witnesses, because the ones that I do have are already paid off my Arifin. Afterwards I made a report with the Polresta. Yesterday the Polresta sent a rejection notice of my charges. They don’t want to accept my charges. My charges of fraud and domestic abuse were rejected by them. I then made a report on the abortion. The Polresta again rejected my report. They say that I was trying to slander Arifin, because they have been paid off by Arifin. I then was told to go home. I said that I will go home, but I will return to file more charges. The police said that if I don’t have sufficient witnesses and evidence, I would never win. I told them that I will present evidence. I was pregnant with his child, I was held as his captive for four years. I never met any other men. I told that to the police. But they would not believe me, because they are on his payroll. The report that the police recorded is different from the story that I told them. I had been at Tanjung Pinang since 2003. But the police recorded June 2006 in the report. I refused to accept that. But Ms. Lily said to go along with it for the time being. She said that if I decide to file more charges in the future, the police’s misdeeds will be revealed. I also filed charges of violence with the police. I was cut with a knife, and the hospital at Tanjung Pinang confirmed that there is a scar caused by a sharp object on my back. But the police did not accept it as evidence. They said that this is not a case of violence. So I asked them, “what kind of a case is this?” The police want a blood stained shirt as evidence. It impossible to find a bloodstained shirt from 2004. It is impossible that I still keep it with me. I told the police it would not make sense for me to keep holding to the bloodstained shirt. It would not make sense. If you were in my position, would you keep holding on to that shirt while being kept locked up in a room? But the police insisted to keep looking for that shirt. They also want to look for the knife. But the knife, after Arifin used it to stab my back, was also taken away by him. Arifin was also scared at that time. As for the charges of fraud. Arifin naturally would throw away evidence of my ever living in his house, but the police insisted that they look for such evidence. I received a letter, saying that the investigation cannot be continued. I only seek damages for my family, for me. Arifin says he’ll find me wherever I go. Even if I live with the President, he will find me. I said, you can just find me at the Kramat Jati Police Hospital. He said he will meet me this afternoon. I said to him I’ll wait for him. I’ll wait for him with one hundred reporters here.","Ros is an Indonesian woman who was a domestic slave in Indonesia. She became enslaved after being made a false offer of work by a man who then imprisoned her and physically abused her for four years. Her attempts to run away failed more than once because of the complicity of officials and others in her enslavement. Her narrative suggests that the police deliberately hampered their own investigation and refused to take Ros’ situation seriously. The government has taken some positive steps towards protecting domestic workers. Following pressure from local and international organisations, including Walk Free, the Indonesian House of Representatives recommended the Domestic Workers Protection Bill for its list of priority legislation in 2016. Ros was enslaved without leaving Indonesia, but significant numbers of Indonesians are exploited in forced labor and debt bondage abroad in Asia and the Middle East, primarily in domestic service, factories, construction, and manufacturing, on Malaysian palm oil plantations, and on fishing vessels throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans."
Rosa,2000 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"When I was 14, a man came to my parents’ house in Veracruz, Mexico and asked me if I was interested in making money in the United States. He said I could make many times as much money doing the same things that I was doing in Mexico. At the time, I was working in a hotel cleaning rooms and I also helped around my house by watching my brothers and sisters. He said I would be in good hands, and would meet many other Mexican girls who had taken advantage of this great opportunity. My parents didn’t want me to go, but I persuaded them. A week later, I was smuggled into the United States through Texas to Orlando, Florida. It was then the men told me that my employment would consist of having sex with men for money. I had never had sex before, and I had never imagined selling my body. And so my nightmare began. Because I was a virgin, the men decided to initiate me by raping me again and again, to teach me how to have sex. Over the next three months, I was taken to a different trailer every 15 days. Every night I had to sleep in the same bed in which I had been forced to service customers all day. I couldn’t do anything to stop it. I wasn’t allowed to go outside without a guard. Many of the bosses had guns. I was constantly afraid. One of the bosses carried me off to a hotel one night, where he raped me. I could do nothing to stop him. Because I was so young, I was always in demand with the customers. It was awful. Although the men were supposed to wear condoms, some didn’t, so eventually I became pregnant and was forced to have an abortion. They sent me back to the brothel almost immediately. I cannot forget what has happened. I can’t put it behind me. I find it nearly impossible to trust people. I still feel shame. I was a decent girl in Mexico. I used to go to church with my family. I only wish none of this had ever happened.  ","In 1997, at the age of 14, Rosa was trafficked from Mexico into sex slavery in the US. She was transported into Texas, then to a trailer in Florida. Up to four young women worked in the same trailer, each of them having sex with up to 35 men a day, for 12 hours a day. They were constantly guarded, and beaten and raped by their bosses. After Rosa had been enslaved for several months, FBI agents, along with agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and local law offices, raided the brothel. Some of her captors were tried, others escaped and returned to Mexico. The US Department of Justice estimates that of the 14,500 and 17,500 foreign-born individuals trafficked into the US annually, some 80 percent are female, and 70 percent of these women end up as sex slaves. Feeder countries include Albania, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico (many from the central region of Tlaxcala, a haven for modern-day slave traders), Nigeria, and Ukraine. Often the women are forced to work to pay off the debts imposed by their smugglers—debts ranging from $40,000 to $60,000 per person. They might perform 4000 acts of sexual intercourse each year to meet their quota, at $10 to $25 per act."
Roxana,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I want all of you to understand that I am going to tell you my story, or a little bit of my story, and mainly because I’m hoping that all of you will get a little bit more of awareness and understanding that I’m not just a number, that I’m a real person.  I am the victim of a web of traffickers in the state that I was trafficked. I was initially recruited and brought to the U.S. for this by a family member. And I am going to specifically focus on the neglect, on the health care industry, where I ended up many times as a result of what was being done to me. Shortly after I got here, after being sold repeatedly, like you sell merchandise on a street, I started having health issues. I was taken to a clinic where the people who were handling me at the time filled out all of my paperwork. They answered most of the questions for me. And they gave me a rehearsed story that I had to tell the doctor once I went in the room, to the result of no one asking a single question about what was happening to me. The doctor noticed that I had lacerations, that I was severely bleeding, and that I had a severe urinary tract infection, for which she asked what was going on that I had all these symptoms. And because I had been told to rehearse the story, I answered what I was told, which was – I was told to say that I had a partner, a romantic partner, who was very large and who was the cause of all these symptoms that I had. And the doctor believed it. Looking back now, there were so many abnormalities with what was happening to me. These people were answering questions for me. They never left me alone. They filled out my paperwork. Still I was discharged back to these people. And she says the concerning thing here is the neglect, but also that responsibilities were delegated from everyone who came into the room and interviewed me and spoke to me. No one made the effort to make a phone call to get me help. Like that occasion, there were many other occasions where I ended up in the health care industry. I’m going to tell you about the most powerful one. I ended up pregnant by one of the handlers. The second time that I ended up at a health care center, by then I was seven months pregnant. And as you can imagine, I had no previous care at all because I was being trafficked the whole entire time that I was pregnant. With four months of pregnancy, I was still being forced to serve between 40, sometimes 50 johns a day. One day I saw 59. I was taken to a family health care center that had access to all of my medical records. They could see that I had been experiencing these lacerations and these infections. I had infections in my kidneys. I had all kinds of symptoms related to the amount of sexual activity that I was being exposed to. And once again no one asked a single question. No one asked if I needed any help. No one asked if I – if they could do anything to help me in any way. They accepted the same stupid, ridiculous answer that I was taught to say, that I had had a very large partner.  I ended up at the hospital one more time to give birth, and it ended up being a C-section. Once again these people never left me alone. The two handlers that I had at the time took turns staying with me in the room at all times. Once again no one saw this as a red flag. We talk so much in the health care industry about privacy. What happened to my privacy? I had none. And all of the people that came into the room could notice that no one was leaving me alone at any time.  This to me is still incredible. Every woman spends time choosing a name for their child. You start looking for suggestions. You start thinking of this. I didn’t have that opportunity, and it happened right in front of the health care professionals. I did not get to name my child. The social worker was the only person at the hospital that realized that something was wrong; once again, did nothing. She realized that I did not choose the name on the birth certificate. And instead of asking for help, she simply came up to me and said I know this is not the name that you chose, so I’m just going to white out the first three letters, and then you can have this name instead. That’s how she helped me – did not call anyone for anything else. That was all I received.  That social worker asked me why I was afraid of changing the name, and I said because they are going to get mad at me. That was my response. She still did nothing. Eventually I was discharged with my daughter, who was kidnapped from me at nine months old and taken out of the United States.  During the three-year process that I was being trafficked, I saw other girls, of course, going through the same thing that I was going through, being repeatedly exploited, repeatedly beaten, and sometimes even killed. It’s my understanding that this is a $152 billion industry a year. And it is crazy that we like to think that all we need to be is aware. That’s not all. We need to get involved. We need to take action. Things need to keep changing, and we need to keep going. What kept me going was the thought of my kids.","Roxana is originally from Mexico, but was forced into slavery in the US performing sex work from the age of 14. In the US, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), as amended, prohibits all forms of human trafficking, but there are still an estimated 57,700 people living in slavery within its borders. According to the Global Slavery Index, “The U.S. attracts undocumented workers, migrants, and refugees, who can be at particular risk of vulnerability to human trafficking upon their arrival and during their stay in the U.S. Research undertaken on vulnerable migrant labourer populations in San Diego, California, and in North Carolina suggests that these populations often include undocumented seasonal labourers who experience significant language barriers, cultural non-assimilation, and fear of deportation.” Here Roxana discusses how medical services she accessed while in slavery failed to seize opportunities to understand her situation and act appropriately to remove her from those who enslaved her. The US Department of Justice estimates that of the 14,500 and 17,500 foreign-born individuals trafficked into the US annually, some 80 percent are female, and 70 percent of these women end up as sex slaves. Feeder countries include Albania, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico (many from the central region of Tlaxcala, a haven for modern-day slave traders), Nigeria, and Ukraine.

Ruth,2006 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Liberia (slavery location),"At the time I was 19, and a friend of mine asked me to go and spend time with her in Liberia. We went to a man, and she introduced me to the man like, “this is the one that we are going to Liberia with.” Then all of a sudden she told me like, “oh I forgot one document. Let me go home so that I will go and collect it.” I said, “ok, I hope you will come later.” She left. That was the end. I never saw her again. We left in the car, me and the man. So, after a day or two, we reached Monrovia. He took me to a big compound, telling me, that’s the room that they found for me. That night he asked me to have sex with him. I said, “no, this is not the arrangement, because my friend said we are just coming to spend time here.” Then, in that room, he told me, “don’t you know I am your boss? I bought you from that lady.” After having the sex with him, he kept me in the room, employing other men to come. I was there for two years. I’m a survivor. So I’m not ashamed to tell them: “I was there, but God brought me out for a special purpose.” And this is the purpose, to tell my testimony, and tell people that this thing is happening. Now I talk in villages and schools, telling them about my past experience. After giving them the definition of human trafficking, I always back it up with my story. So people will know that this thing is a real thing. It is happening. I am hoping that this thing will come to a stop. We are ready to fight what is going on now. ","Settled with freed slaves from the US after 1822, and founded as a republic in 1847, Liberia was named to mean “the country of the free.” But today, men, women and children are trafficked into slavery within Liberia, and children are brought into the country for domestic and sexual slavery from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Cote d’Ivoire. Children are also trafficked out of Liberia to Guinea, The Gambia, and Nigeria—as well as to Cote d’Ivoire for use in combat. And during Liberia’s civil war, which ended after 14 years in 2003, both government forces and rebel factions forcibly recruited many thousands of children for use in combat and as messengers and porters. Ruth Kamara was trafficked into sex slavery in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, in the early 1990s. She was brought from Sierra Leone, where women and children are also trafficked out to Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, the Middle East, and Europe. As in Liberia, a civil war in Sierra Leone between government and rebel forces has prompted forcible recruitment for combat. In addition, that war of 1991-2002 displaced more than two million people, many of whom became at risk of exploitation by traffickers. There are no reliable statistics for either Liberia or Sierra Leone, but more broadly, across all the countries of West and Central Africa, around 300,000 children are trafficked into slavery each year. Now fashioning the abolitionist movement as a mini civil war that she is “ready to fight,” Ruth explains that her weapon in that war is her testimony as a survivor. She speaks to people in her country, defines human trafficking for them, and then will “always back it up with my story.”"
Sabina,2006 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bangladesh (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I’m the eldest child in the family. We're very poor because my father had two wives. There are eight of us altogether. None of us ever went to school. I stayed at home to help my mother. We went from house to house to do cleaning in exchange for food. When I was 12 years old, an Indian lady used to come to visit us. We were really poor and she always told me, 'See, nobody can feed you here. If you come with me, I'd give you a better job. So come with me, but don't tell anyone.’ I didn't really know her but I was tempted by the idea of having a job. One day, I told my parents that I'm just going out with this auntie and I'll be back very soon. I didn't take anything with me, I just left with her. I felt good that I was going to get a job but I was feeling a bit scared because I was going to a new place and I wouldn't know anyone. Also, I'm totally illiterate - I can't read or write - so I couldn't read anything to know where I was. The lady sold me to a house. I tried to escape but the door was locked and there were no windows. They gave me food once a day, a bit of rice and dhal or chapatti. I was sick after seven days. During those seven days, they tortured me two, three times a day. There were 10 to 15 men every day and they did all kinds of things to me. When I protested, they tied me with rope and beat me. I thought ‘I’m almost dead’. I wanted to die. I used to do all the housework at the house and sometimes I also worked outside, selling pots and pans. But at night, I had to do a lot of work that was really bad. I had to give company to the men who came at night. Even now, the villagers still say bad things in front of me. They don't even bother to say it behind my back. All I hear every day is: ‘See, this is a bad woman, she went to India.’","Born in Bangladesh, Sabina was 12 years old when she was taken to a brothel in India. She was locked up and raped repeatedly until she managed to escape. Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India."
Sandeep,2005 (Narrative date),Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was 12 years old when brought to the carpet loom. My father was working in brick kilns as a daily wage labor with no sufficient money to fill the stomachs of his five sons and one daughter. The miserable condition of the family was very disappointing for me. I always felt bad about the situation but not able to help out. Day came, when one of the agents of the loom owner arrived to meet my father. At that time I was very curious to know why this man has come and started dreaming about my better future without knowing the consequences of it. The agent told my father that I would be in a better place than the present situation. Tricked by the man my father decided to send me with him. I also agreed to go since many other children were going along with him without knowing the upshot of it. When I came to the loom, I came to know that the agent was the owner’s younger brother. From the time I entered the loom I was told very harshly to learn to weave carpet of the required length. It was a very bad experience for me. Anyhow I tried to adjust with it. But the things were not going in right direction I felt. I was made to work on looms from early morning, four am, to late at night, 10.30pm, with only two hours of break for daily activities and lunch as well as dinner. The owner’s father made me wake up early in the morning along with the other boys to work and by chance if I am not able to wake up and do the work at that time I was given hard thrashes on both my cheeks. One day I was beaten so badly by the owner’s father, I got a fracture in my hand and no treatment was given for my recovery. I always demanded education as per promises made by the agent but I received beatings on my knees and elbows rather than pen and books. This went against my self-respect. Hence I tried to escape but was unfortunately caught. I tied the rope from the terrace of the house in which we were working and came down through it at midnight. I ran from that place and came nearly 25 kilometers away from that place. Since I was walking across the road and did not have a single penny to go by bus, I was caught by the man who was a watch dog for us. I failed to escape and was again in the trap of bondage. During night after work, I always used to think of my family and cry but there was no hope for me. I wish that in the future I will become a policeman and break the knees and elbows of these slaveholders, and not allow any children to go along with them even if he gives scores of money.   ","Sandeep was enslaved in a carpet loom in Uttar Pradesh. He was liberated by activists from Bal Vikas Ashram (BVA), an organization that liberates and rehabilitates child slaves. He was found weaving carpets, wearing only underwear, and had been forced to weave rugs for 12-15 hours a day, beginning at 6am. From BVA he received medical care, counseling, literacy training, and basic rights education.
More than 300,000 children are estimated to be trapped in India’s carpet industry in India, and there are also an estimated 500,000 children in the same industry in Pakistan. Most of India’s carpets are woven in Uttar Pradesh, where the majority of workers are low-caste Hindu boys. Some are lured into bondage by agents’ promises to their parents that they will receive good wages, and others are kidnapped. The boys are forced to work for no pay, for 10-18 hours a day, seven days a week. They are beaten, tortured, branded, kept half fed and half clad, and are usually made to sleep in the loom shed. Cuts and wounds are frequent."
Sanije,2005 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Forced marriage,Albania (trafficked from) Forced marriage,Greece (slavery location),"I am 17 years old. I was born in a city in the south of Albania. Four sisters, two brothers, my mother, and my father compose my family. My parents do not work; they used to live by begging in the streets or by the money that one of my sisters as well as one of my brothers sends to them. They are working as illegal immigrants in Greece, I think. We used to change our residence frequently; we never had a real house. We used to live in just one room with the toilet outside. When I was 14 years old, my family (my father I mean, because he was the one who decided for the family) arranged for me to marry someone who was living in Greece. I married him even though I had just seen him a few times when he came to Albania. We got married, and we went to live in Greece illegally. Even my marriage was not a formal one; it was an agreement between my father and him. I stayed with him for one year. During this time he was emotionally abusive of me and physically violent towards me. He used to spend money by going to discos, and it seemed to me that he didn’t do any work at all. I did not know where he used to find the money. He had regular documents; I didn’t. I worked for one month in a bar as a cleaner. My husband used to go to this bar, and he used to steal things there, so after one month my employer fired me. My husband threatened me by saying that he was going to put me to work on the streets as a prostitute. At this point I decided to denounce him to the police. I denounced him for his abusive treatment of me, the physical violence even while I was pregnant, and for all the rest. The Greek police deported me to Albania through the crossing point of Kapshtica. I was left on the border of Albania near a village. I didn’t know anybody there, and I did not know any place to go. I was pregnant and scared. A family there hosted me for one night. The next day I went to the city of my birth, by mini-bus. I couldn’t find my parents because they had changed their home again. I contacted my sister who lives with her family in a village. My sister paid the driver of the minibus. When I arrived in Albania, I was five months pregnant. I stayed with my family until the birth of my child. Even my parents were against it. They wanted me to have an abortion because they said they didn’t have money to raise my baby. I gave birth to a baby girl. I called her Sara. Meanwhile my family arranged for me another marriage with an old Italian man. He was 60 years old. He wouldn’t allow me to leave the house, and he abused me sexually. I was distressed. I decided to leave him when I met a guy from the same village, someone I had known since I was ten years old. This guy was a friend of my father and used to serve as a translator between me and my Italian husband at the beginning. He offered to help me go to Italy where I could meet my other sisters. Though he was married, he told me he would abandon his wife and children to stay with me and my daughter. He took me to live in hotels for five months. He told me he loved me, and I believed him. He promised to find me a good job in Italy, and I believed him. Later on, I found out that he wanted me to be a prostitute when I met some other girls who were staying at the last hotel where I stayed in Vlora. They were both Albanian and foreign girls. He began to beat me and told me that I must abandon my daughter. I did not want to do that, but he threatened to kill my daughter and me. I was all alone and scared. Then he promised me that if I left her somewhere, it would be better because she could never survive the trip through the sea by speedboat to Italy. He promised we could take the baby back after some months. I did what he told me. I could not do any other way. He cheated me and forced me to abandon my daughter. One night we woke up at three in the morning and went by speedboat. Fortunately the police caught us, and they referred me to a safe place here in Albania.    ","Born in Albania, Sanije was “married” to a stranger in Greece by her father, then later to another man, both of whom abused her. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply."
Santino,1999 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was caught last Spring. My master was Abdullai Mohammed. He lives in Daein. I had to look after his cows and goats. Abdullai often beat me. He also sent me every night to the koranic school. Sometimes the PDF came to the school to recruit for the Mujahadeen. They said they would teach us to shoot guns and fight against the Dinka in rebel areas. They promised that I would get my own cows and goats if I did this. I refused to go with them. Because of this, Fekki Ibrahim beat me badly.","Santino was ‘redeemed’ (bought out of slavery) by Christian Solidarity International (CSI), a Zurich-based international human rights organization, in 1999. Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Seema,2016 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I had been placed with two different employers in Delhi before I met the National Domestic Workers Movement (NDWM). I wasn’t paid for the work that I did over two years, except for the absolute minimum that I needed to survive. My employers would shout at me, insult me and beat me.  Finally, I was given NDWM’s number, and the very next day after I called them, a staff member came to the house, accompanied by the police, and rescued me. My employers still didn’t pay me, but I was just so happy to leave that place anyway. ","Seema was one of an estimated 4 million domestic workers in India. The domestic sector is informal and unregulated, obscured in private homes, and workers are not recognised as such but rather as ‘informal help’. Their wages are, on average, only a third of those in other sectors, they have very limited social protections, and commonly suffer poor working conditions, exploitation, abuse and slavery. Many domestic workers are migrants from poorer states and are among the most marginalised and socially discriminated populations in India. Most of them are Dalits or come from other disadvantaged castes and tribal minorities, many are landless, illiterate and innumerate, which increases their vulnerability and disempowerment."
Shahid,2016 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,Saudi Arabia (slavery location),"When I arrived, my passport was taken from me and I was told I was going to be a shepherd, not work in the job I was promised. I protested – I was educated and trained – I did not come to Saudi Arabia to be a shepherd. My employer said things had changed, then he ‘gave’ me to someone else.  This new person was a police officer. He also had a farm – a big farm. It was so big that he had a helicopter that he flew sometimes to remote parts of the farm. I was forced to be a shepherd there – to do ‘animal husbandry’. I lived out in the desert, in a shed with a tarpaulin roof. I was given basic food, it was not enough. It was some rice, dahl, also the same food as the animals, animal fodder.  I was not allowed to leave the farm. He took my passport, but did not give me a residence permit.  I couldn’t go anywhere without it. Luckily, I met a worker from India nearby – he leant me his phone and I messaged my family here. This person was working in the farm for more than two years, but he chose to continue since he had no other way of repaying debts back home. I left India to try and earn more money – to have a good job. I was told by the agent – that I had to pay 85,000 rupees (approx. £880) to him. I thought he was the agent, but there was another one in Mumbai. The one in the village was a sub-agent. I didn’t ask if he was registered – I didn’t know. I gave him the money. I received the contract only with the air ticket, a day before my departure. It was a piece of paper in Arabic. One day, after I had told my family [who had complained via an Indian Government mechanism], the ‘employer’ dropped me at the airport. He said I could go home and gave me my passport and a flight ticket. I didn’t get any wages at all – he said that he deducted the air ticket cost from my wages and there was none left.  I mortgaged my farm land for this. ","Shahid was trafficked to Saudi Arabia from his home in India after being given false promises of good, well-paid work. His passport was taken away and he was forced to work as a shepherd on a huge farm, despite his objections. Anti-Slavery International has found that Shahid’s experience is now a common one, with many Indians travelling to the Persian Gulf and being forced to perform more menial jobs than they had agreed to."
Shahnara,2000 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from),United Arab Emirates (slavery location),"I was 12 when my mother died. My father and my uncle had been using drugs for many years. Soon my father was imprisoned, I do not know for what offense. My uncle sold everything in our house to buy drugs. When I was 13 he forced me out to the street. I was living in the streets, sleeping under benches in the park. He told me to sell myself if I was not able to find money in another way. I went to the police and they sent me to Vartashen orphanage. Once my classmate told me that there was a woman in her neighborhood helping young pretty girls to go to Germany to work for a fashion magazine. I could not believe it. I was so happy. Later the woman told me that after she had arranged documents for me and other persons we would all travel together to Germany. After a short while the papers were ready and we could to start off. There were 14 of us, girls of different ages between 13 and 23. We went by taxi to Tbilisi, from there we traveled to Moscow and from Moscow to Dubai, as we found out later. The woman who had recruited me had 27 children employed mostly from orphanages, or from the streets. She deals in this business for 12 years already. The hell I lived through at home continued in Dubai. They placed us in a hotel. They had special interest in young virgins. They were selling them at enormous prices to rich Arab sheikhs for one night, after which they were working with clients like other ordinary girls. We received only a fraction of what the sheikhs gave to the pimp. In some cases the girls received some special presents from the sheikhs. My friend who was 13 was taken to a wealthy man. In the end the man asked her what she wanted from him as a present. The girl asked for two sacks of flour. Even the money given to the girls as a gift was confiscated by the pimps. Two days later they took us to a night-club and explained the nature of our work and the amount that we should pay them every day. They explained that they had paid a lot of money for our passports and travel, in total $6000 for permission to fly and tickets. They were also paying for our room and food. Almost all the children were crying. They could not understand what was expected from them and how they were going to do it. The Arab partner of our pimp was getting angry when he was not getting the amount of money they were expecting us to provide. He was beating children with a belt and was very violent. I was also crying at the very beginning, but what could I do? Sometimes there were rich businessmen who hired us every time they came to Dubai. I was very happy when one businessman called me and said he was coming to Dubai. He spent his time only with me. He rented a room for me where I stayed and sometimes we went shopping together. The pimp also placed children with us when they were not able to earn enough money and requested the businessman to pay for them too, although at a somewhat cheaper price. After nights of work we were getting so tired that we could not do anything else but sleep. We did not communicate with each other. We were living in different hotels, even though we were from the same country and were together on the same flight. When our visas expired we traveled with our pimp to Iran to extend the visas. We stayed there for no more than two hours. Our passports were usually given to us at the airport and taken away after passport control. We could not run away or complain to the police since they assured us that they were bribed. One of my clients who was working for the immigration police threatened my pimp and took my passport back. Later on I was caught by the police again and deported through Moscow. As I was deported I could not even bring the small things that the clients had given to me. My Arab client promised to send those presents to me. I have twice been in UAE. As soon as I came back home, I decided to buy a small one-room flat because I had spent most of my life in the streets and I wanted to have my own home. As I was under 18 I could not register property on my name, so I did it on my uncle’s name. A month later he needed money for drugs so he sold my flat and everything I had in it.  ","Born in Armenia, Shahnara was trafficked to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where an estimated 10,000 women from sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, Iraq, Iran, and Morocco are victims of sex trafficking. In addition, victims of child camel jockey trafficking still remain in the UAE: thousands of young boys have been trafficked from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Mauritania to work as camel jockeys, and though the UAE enacted a law banning the practice in July 2005, questions persist as to the effectiveness of the ban."
Shahnawaz,2005 (Narrative date),Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I will give a great punch on the face of the trafficker if he enters my village again. I will be a great trouble for him. He has tortured me very much; he did not allow me to play with my friends. I was a very small child in the loom, eight years old. I was there for one month this one month was very scary for me. My family is at the breadline hence my parents fell easily into the trick of the trafficker. He told my father that I will be getting 200 rupees [$4] a month and I will be working in good conditions at a good place. But that man has cheated me and my family. I was forced to work for more than 16 hours a day, with insufficient food to eat and in a room where there was too much suffocation because of the smell of the woolen threads used for weaving carpet. Every day we were made to complete at least 200 rupees worth of part of a carpet. Once a week or so, I was paid ten or 20 rupees [$0.20-0.45] by the broker who brought me. He was getting all my money, near about 110 rupees [$2] from the owner. Same was done with the other children too. Being a small child I was getting beatings from the broker and sometimes from the owner. Most of the time that broker was there to supervise our work. I never dreamt of such a poor condition at this age when other children play and enjoy. I was working continuously on the loom for more than 16 hours daily. I feel that this is an injustice to we poor children.","Shahnawaz was enslaved in a carpet loom in Uttar Pradesh.

Shengqui,1997 (Narrative date),Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"From January 1983, I was a prisoner at the Shanghai Municipal Prison because of my political statements. The government had devised a system of work points to control the prisoners. Prisoners were forced to labor. Work points were deducted for failure to fulfill quotas. Once or twice a week, a prisoner could watch TV. Once a month they could watch a movie, buy foodstuffs, or meet with their family. These benefits were deprived for failure to fulfill quotas or for bad performance in reform. Hence, many prisoners were forced to labor overtime to maintain the work points. Those who were slower could have only three or four hours of sleep a day. I witnessed how the prison established a radio assembly shop. As I learned from the other prisoners and policemen, the prison also ran a regular print shop and other shops. From July 1993 to April 1994, I was incarcerated at the 2nd Company, 3rd Battalion, Shanghai Re-education-Through-Labor Farm located at Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province. Again, my political activities were my crime. In cooperation with Shanghai No. 18 Knitting Mill, the battalion made interlock jerseys. Re-education-through-labor or Laojiao inmates were forced to labor and reform their thinking. In the busiest time, they had to labor nearly 20 hours a day. Inmates, while working at sewing machines, often fell asleep. In slack season, several hours a day inmates sat on benches studying, writing a report of what they learned from the studies. The 1st Company, 3rd Battalion, established a shop for making the teaching slides. In April 1994, I was transferred to the 5th Battalion. In 1994 and in 1995, I witnessed how from June to October the battalion’s 2nd Company assembled multi-colored Christmas lights for export for Haiman Lamps Factory and a lamps factory of the Jiangsu Province. Each box consisted of 36, 50, 100 or 200 lights on a string. The lights I have at hand are similar with those processed at the 2nd Company. The task was hard. Every inmate had to labor overtime, many laboring until one or two at night. Those who failed to fulfill quotas were punished. Inmates at the woolen sweater mill also often labored overtime. Inmates in farming had to labor overtime even more. For instance, inmates who transplanted rice seedlings often labored from seven in the morning until eight at night. On Laojiao farms, inmates were often beaten and cursed. The government cadres cuffed and kicked them at will. Those Laojiao inmates trusted to supervise other inmates beat and cursed them even more. I was also beaten by them. In China, reform-through-labor or Laogai and Laojiao facilities are not common prisons, but are the Communist party’s tool for consolidating its one-party rule. Not only do the facilities force prisoners to labor for profit, they also force inmates to accept brainwashing. The thought reform made them surrender to the Communist party.","Unknown numbers of people have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps). Created by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong, the Laogoi system was intended to “reeducate criminals” and has long used prisoners as a source of cheap labor. Labor and pro-democracy activists have been targeted for Laogai imprisonment: Fu Shengqi was held repeatedly between 1981 and 1995 on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda, and was granted political asylum in the US in 1996."
Shenli,2003 (Narrative date),Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"My name is Lin Shenli and my nationality is Chinese. I was born in Shanghai on November 16, 1954. I am currently residing in Toronto, Canada. I started to practice Falun Gong in 1996. On July 21, 1999, under Jiang Zemin's insane persecution of Falun Gong, I was kidnapped by the police, who locked me up in a police station for two months. This was just so that I could be brainwashed into giving up Falun Gong. On December 24 the same year, I went to Beijing to appeal for Falun Gong. I was again arrested and sent back to Shanghai Pingliang Police Station. I was locked up for 48 hours, and then I was detained for a further 15 days because I had refused to give up my belief in “Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance”. On January 24, 2000, because I called on the government to have a peaceful dialogue with Falun Gong practitioners, I was sentenced to one and a half years in a labor camp. I was sent to The No. 3 Labor Camp and was assigned to the 1st Section of the 2nd Division. The address is PO Box 1/902, Shichahe, Dafeng, Jiangsu. In the labor camp, every morning I was forced to get up to start work around 6:00 am. I was not allowed to stop until 9:00 pm. The work was manual labor, making rubber sports balls. It involved using iron needles to punch holes and then using threads to stitch through the holes and the two threads had to be pulled and tightened at the end of the process. After long periods of the same repeated tasks, my hands got mutilated by the threads and started to bleed. The threads were waxed and prisoners informed me that wax is poisonous. That explained why both of my hands were swollen and infected. Due to long hours of intensive labor work, a large area of my chest and buttocks began to bleed and ulcerate. Especially, in the ulcerated buttock area, blood seeped onto my underwear and tracksuit pants. Every day my clothes were like they had been soaked in blood and water. As the blood dried up on my underwear and then became wet again, several times a day, the underwear would eventually get stuck onto my skin. This made walking very difficult, including taking off my underwear when going to the toilet. Every time when I had to force it off, a layer of my skin would be peeled off as well. At night, I couldn't sleep properly because I couldn't lie down. Coupled with the long hours of hard intensive labor work, I was exhausted. If I did fall asleep at night, it was restless as, if I accidentally touched the sore parts of my body, I would be woken up by the most excruciating pain. Even though I was in this condition, I was not allowed to rest. I was still forced to work intensively. Through forced labor, the cost of the production of goods in China was kept very low. It didn't matter whether we were Falun Gong practitioners or criminals, we didn't get paid for our work. A variety of rubber sports balls were made, including Adidas and some Japanese brands. Some were made for souvenirs and exported, as I was informed by prisoners while they were teaching me how to make the balls. They were not only exploiting prisoners to earn foreign exchange currency, but they also wanted me to give up my belief in “Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance.” When I refused, they extended my term for a further six months. Hence I was detained in labor camp for a total of two years. ","Lin Shenli was sentenced to 18 months of “reeducation through labor” in a Chinese prison camp on January 23, 2000 for taking part in illegal Falun Gong activities. He was released in January 2002, after two years in the labor camp. Unknown numbers of people have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps).

Shivnarayan,2005 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour,India (trafficked from) Forced labour,India (slavery location),"I came three years before along with my father to work at a stone mine. Due to the distressed situation of the family, my father decided to go outside the village to earn daily bread for our subsistence. After three years only my father expired. For the cremation of my father I took Rs.1000 and one tin of vanaspati Ghee from the contractor without knowing the consequences of it. After the death of my father, I brought my five children Shyamkali (14), Nebbulal (12), Bablu (10), Gopi (8) and Ramkali (6) to work with me since there was no one to take care of these children. My wife expired six years back. Now I was in the trap of bondage which I was not able to see with my naked eyes. My children also started working with me deprived of their basic amenities. They use to break heavy stones with the hammer and chisel in their delicate hands. I felt very awful about the dejected condition of my children. All this became part of my family and it was carried on for more than a year. During this period, one of the employees at the stone mine tried to sexually harass my elder daughter. She told each and every thing to me about this case. On hearing all these things, I was very much annoyed and complained about that particular employee to the contractor. But the contractor, instead of taking any action against him started blaming me using bad words and also warned me not to come again with any other complaint otherwise he will not spare me. I tried to leave the work and return with my family to my native village, but the contractor did not allow me to go and reminded me, until and unless I don’t return the money taken in debt, we will be not allowed to go back. Now I was able to see very clearly that my family was in bondage. My dignity was injured after my daughter’s case and anyhow I wanted to come out from the trap along with my family. In this regard I decided to escape leaving my children at the stone mine. I returned to my village and told every one about the situation but no one was there to help me. During this course of time I came to know from informal sources that Bal Vikas Ashram helps the victim in all these cases. I visited BVA and told each and every thing about the exploitation of my family. Ultimately my family was released due to sincere efforts of BVA and I wish that no other families get into the trap of bondage.  Narrative as told to Free the Slaves.","Shivnarayan and his children were enslaved in a stone quarry in India. They came to freedom in July 2005. The survey data suggest that there are more than 18 million people or 1.4 percent of the total population, who are living in conditions of modern slavery in India. Industries implicated in survey data include domestic work, the construction and sex industries, agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, manual labour, and forced begging. Most of India’s slavery problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata—lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups—are most vulnerable."
Sina,2009 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Vietnam (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"My name is Vann Sina. This is my Cambodian name, but my original name is Vien Ti Bet….I’m twenty-five years old, and I work in the Somaly Mam Foundation. And I’m in the Voice for the Victims. Before coming to work here in Somaly Mam, I worked in Afesip for six years, in an outreach project, and I went to brothels. I went to the brothels, and I educated the sex workers about HIV, AIDS and STDs. And also part of my outreach project, I investigated new girls who came into the brothels. So when we received the information that there are new girls in the brothels, we report it to the investigation specialist, and they come to rescue the girls. I’m very happy with my work here in Somaly Mam. So what I do here at Somaly Mam is I collect all the voices of the victims, and I want to tell the outside world that they – that the sex workers – do not want to do that work. We don’t want those who buy sex to think that, though the sex workers smile and are happy before them, that does not mean that they want to do that work. In the brothel, owners are very smart. Nowadays, before sending the girls out to work, they kind of drugged the girls, obsessively. And I was asked, “Why do you want to help them? Because they want to do the work.” And then I said back, “How much do you know about them?” So they cannot go anywhere far from the brothels, just like they are – they’re two people: like, one is their own life and also the life, like drug. So in order to help them to get off drug, it’s hard, and it needs to spend a lot of time, like over a year. So as a former victim, I understand how it feels to be a sex worker, and when she told me that she wants to leave, but she cannot. So the outreach work goes very well, and we can help the girls who are not using drugs, so we help them just in time. The work is dangerous. The brothel owner does not like the work that I do because I will put them out of business. So this is the experience that I got, and I wanted to help the victims out of their situation. I experienced a lot of pain, and I cannot put words into it. And I don’t want any other girls to experience pain like I did. I never think that it’s dangerous, that it’s risky. I never think that when I would die. Because my dream in my childhood died. And nowadays I’m living with anger against the brothel owners, which is the strength for me to help the victims. I’m Vietnamese, and I was born in Cantau. I lived with my grandmother. I studied in grade three. I never lived with my mother. I lived with my grandmother. I never saw my parents. And I was very disappointed, very upset, that my parents can support…can raise…my brothers and sisters up but not me. Knowing that is unbearable. And my study kind of dropped down. And I failed my school. And my friend Giang knows someone who often goes in and out of the school. And Giang was invited to Phnom Penh to join a Christmas program. A person tells us that she goes in and out of the country very often. And Giang is one of my best friends. I told Giang how I felt disappointed, upset about my parents. And knowing that, Jan said to me that, why not come to Cambodia with me? I asked her, how can we come to Cambodia. And she told me that there is a woman who often comes in and out of the country she knows it very well, and she can bring us to Cambodia without us telling anybody. I came to Cambodia through Longbon Road with my friend Giang and the lady.  When I stepped into Cambodia my childhood ended there. And I experienced my childhood only up until I was thirteen. And my dark side of my life started. When I stepped into Cambodia, my life was intimidated. I was told that I am Vietnamese; I cannot go in and out of the country easily. Otherwise I will be caught by the police. And I was not allowed to speak, just to shut up. I came into Cambodia, and I was asked to stay in a guesthouse for a couple of days. I always asked to go back home because I was never allowed out. So I was threatened that if I ever wanted to go out I would be caught by the police, and I understand that the police have authority because my father is also a policeman. And the next day, Giang and I were taken to a bar. After, he promised me to take me back to my country because I demanded him to do that.          He never took me back to my country. He took me to somewhere dark. He took me somewhere that I never forgot. I was taken to somewhere in the central market, somewhere near the Lux Cinema. I was tricked into a café shop, and I was told that it is their relative’s house. And I don’t know what they were talking to the café owner about, but a couple of minutes later, Giang was taken away from me, and I was left there. I wanted to go with them, but I was told to wait there and he will come back. He never returned. I waited and waited, and I wanted to just walk out. But the café owner didn’t want me to. I asked her to go out, but I was not allowed to. And I followed her into the house. And there was no way out. The back door was locked. When I got inside the house, the girls, the sex workers there in the house, said to me that you are now sold. And I don’t know what it means to be sold. How can it be that humans sell humans? I was scared, and I told them that I’m not an animal, why do you sell me? The girls in the house told me that I am sold to be a sex worker, and still I don’t understand what it means. And the brothel owner threatened me: if I don’t go up into the room, I will be killed. I was forced into the room, and I had to sleep on the floor, not even on a bed. I felt very lonely then. I really missed my grandmother, and I really missed everybody there. I realized that I would die there. I don’t know what I’m doing there. I was sleeping like a kitten near a table. I got up, and I was very thirsty, and I saw a coconut nearby, and I drank it. After then, I don’t know what was going on. And I woke up; I realized that I was in bed. I opened my eyes, and I realized that my life is completely ruined. I opened my eyes; I saw the mattress over me. With blood. All over. I didn’t know where the blood came from. I was hurt. I could not get out of bed easily. I had to crawl out of bed. I went into the bathroom; I was sitting on the toilet; I was spraying water over me, wondering, what am I doing, what am I doing? What happened to me? Why is there blood all over me? And it was very saddened. I don’t know where to go. I don’t know what that place is. Surely it’s just – I don’t have anything to say. A little bit after that, a customer came in. He slept with me, and he kicked me out of bed. I knew that this was not my dreamt life, but this is me, my real life. And I was hurt. And I was very hurt then. That’s why I understand what it is like for the victims. Because it’s really hard, and it’s really unbearable. I was sleeping with a customer; I was kicked out of bed. And the next day, I was taken back. The café owner gave me two medicines. After taking the two medicines, I didn’t know what happened next. I woke up again. I was in a police station. My new life started then, and I started to have hope. I was asked by the police, where do you want to go? I told the police, I want to go to Vietnam. But my hope was destroyed again… I don’t know how long I was there in the first brothel. I know how long I worked in the second brothel. In the first brothel, it was raided by the police; I was rescued. I thought I could go back to my country because the police help people. Instead, the police took me back to the brothel. That made me really feel hopeless. I went back to the brothel, and I worked as a sex worker there. In a long while after that, I was transferred to another brothel. It’s called Thor Kup area. I was doing sex work there for over a year. The time period of a year is just like my lifetime. My life there was like a life of a dog. I was beaten to eat chilies, and until now, I eat a lot of chilies. I was electrocuted. I was detained under a bed, naked. I used to be detained in a dungeon underground. That’s my life. This is my life. I was taught how to do that in my childhood. All the pain really gives me strength to help other victims. In the brothel I worked non-stop to earn money. Though I was sick and shaking, I had to service customers. If I didn’t service customers, I would be detained in the dungeon with my hands tied at the back. It was really hard, really difficult. On my body there is scars. So the brothel owners are very smart nowadays. They allow the girls to go to hotels and anywhere. And they drug the girls, and after a while they will come back to the brothel owners to get more drugs. After being drugged they cannot make their own decisions; wherever they go, they need to come back. They have to work to get money to buy drugs, so the brothel owners just give enough to make them get high, and they have to work for money to get drugs. That really puts their lives at risk. They don’t care about their health. They do whatever they can to get money to buy drugs. They go with the customers. Some customers even take them to sleep in the bush. They even go with a gang. If you want more information, tomorrow I can ask the girls -- then you will know what is going on in their life. I was given drugs in the first brothel. After taking the drugs I never thought, never cared about my family. The girls that I worked with, they used “yama,” and crystal ice, a new kind of drug. And the price range is different, too. In the first brothel, I could communicate because there were Vietnamese there, and I could eat the food there. In the second brothel, it was like it’s us and them. And me kind of separate from them. In the last brothel, I experienced a lot of beatings, a lot of detention, and I was forced to eat chilies. I was not forced to take drugs – it’s me myself – I took drugs. I remember every step of it. There was a demand for me to service twenty to thirty customers if it’s on the weekend. If I don’t do that up to the standard, I would be forced to eat chilies, and I would be beaten. So every day I would call the customers in, and I would do anything to get the customers. I was scared that I would be beaten. To put it plainly, I’m just like a little bird in their hands. I was very scared of them. I didn’t know what to say to them to stop beating me. In a day, I could eat only two meals. I would work until dawn and would sleep after that. I was doing that [when I was] thirteen years [old]. So when I work in Afesip, I was asked when I was born and then they did the calculation to see how old I was. Then I knew that I was fifteen, then, when I worked in Afesip. When I first came into Afesip, I learned there for about a year…about a year or two. And then I started to work in a garment factory. So I worked hard, and I know that I have a love for children. And so Somaly took me back to work in Afesip. I worked in a brothel for over two years, and my feet never touched the ground. I never imagined that I can stand here. Because every day I would receive punishment. I would service men. I would miss my family. If I wanted to get the sun, I would poke my head out of a little window to get some sun. In the brothel I wanted to escape, but I didn’t know how to. So the house, the brothel house, was above water, and even in the water they planted sharp spikes. It’s not just me that tried to escape, even the girls there tried to escape too. I had a friend of mine there; we never talked with one another. When it was time to go to bed, we just went to bed. We were not allowed to talk; otherwise we would be beaten. I didn’t know that that friend of mine sawed the wooden floor, and she jumped down, and she was caught in the spikes. She was not taken out of the spikes immediately; she was left there for about ten minutes. After, she got taken out of the spikes. They threatened us; they told us, look, if not, your life is just like that too. They took her out. They didn’t take her to the hospital. They locked her in the room. Then every one of us was very scared. So no one cared about others; we just cared about ourselves. When we heard our name called we shook. When I was beaten, I was also tied. I was tied in the dark room. Very dark. Could not see anything. And I thought that I was dead back then. My body ached, my hands were tied to the back, and the mosquitoes were swarming around me. I was naked. What I was only thinking about was that I could do anything as long as the brothel owner didn’t beat me. At that time I would think that now, it’s over; it’s good now. When I opened my eyes, I think that now my fate comes again. Every day I would tap my pillow so that I would dream about my parents, my grandmother. I really missed them. Then Afesip, along with Social Affairs, went to rescue us. When they were doing the raid, the brothel owner asked me to jump into the water, but I didn’t do that. Because there is a place that we could jump into the water safely, which is in the kitchen. So why would I jump? Why would I go with them, with the police? They would take me back. If I went with them, I would die. If I went with the police, I would die. So I was rescued, and I was taken to Afesip. I was asked, “Do you want to go to an organization? Do you want to go to a center?” And I didn’t know what an organization or a center is. I answered them, “Wherever you take me, I know that I will end up in the same place.” In fact, I was taken to Afesip. When I got to Afesip, I felt scared because I saw a lot of women there. When I got there, there was a Vietnamese staff member there. She took care of me, and she explained to me what they do there. I didn’t believe her easily; even the police took me to the brothel, let alone her. And I asked her, “When will you sell me?” And she explained to me that no, we’re not selling you. She would sleep with me, and she would show me the picture of her children. Somaly [Mam, the founder of Afesip] would explain to me that we would help you. She would take me to her house. Then I understood that the organization is trying to help us. She showed me the pictures of the Vietnamese girls: where they are from, what province, and things like that. Then I felt like my life was hopeful again But I still have the bad dreams in my life. Nowadays I have freedom to do whatever I want, to go wherever I want. But my spirit is dead. My dream was to be a teacher. My dream to be a teacher in childhood ended. And now I have another dream, and I achieve. I realize the dream as a teacher now. And it’s a new life. Though I have freedom to do whatever I want, to go wherever I want, I cannot look at myself in the mirror alone. Even in my room I don’t have a full-length mirror because looking at the mirror I would think about my past life. Sometimes during the day, when I was sleeping, and I would think that I’m still in the brothel, and waking up, I felt very scared. The first couple of nights, I could not sleep, so the dream was still in me. So I tried to not think about that, but I felt like the dream and me are just together. All this -- this experience in my childhood – is the strength for me. It makes me want to help all the girls out of slavery because I understand what it is like. I was hurt very badly, I didn’t know what to do. To put it plainly, I didn’t know what to do right. I wanted to kill myself, but I know it hurts to kill myself. I wanted to hold my breath to die, but I couldn’t. Actually, I wanted to kill myself many times, but the ways to do that are really hurtful. I could not find anywhere to even strangle myself. The plate and the spoon I ate with are plastic. Only the cooking pot is made from iron. Even the kitchen, when everything’s finished, the kitchen is locked, and after eating we sleep. When I was really in difficult times, only cigarettes could help me. [Pointing to her wrist] This is the mark from the cigarette that I burned myself with because I was having a very difficult time, and I didn’t know what to do. There is a scar on my head when I was hit with a flashlight. And now even, if I stay in the sun for a long time, I start to have a headache. I don’t know what happened to my head. Because I was hit on the head. I was beaten. They didn’t get me treatment, but still they detained me. I feel like my head has developed tetanus. That’s why I said that my life has now ended. And I said to myself, this is not Sina from childhood but a different Sina. This is different Sina, that people have helped me to become who I am, and I will pay them back. And the people who have hurt me, I wanted to destroy them. I wanted them to stop what they’re doing now, and according to the religious teaching, it’s sin. Doing that is just like killing. Just like I said, the old Sina was dead. And this is a new Sina, and I will help those whom the brothel owner is trying to kill. I want to see [the people who hurt me]. When I see them, I will give them a good gift. Because they gave me a good gift, and I want to return the good gift to them. I tried to look for them, but I don’t know if I have a chance to see them. And I want to say thanks to them for helping me to be who I am now. And I want to help those people who they are trying to kill. [I do not] try to remember. I try to forget, but it never goes away from me. Though there are good things happening to me now, but they don’t equal to the things that happened to me in the past. I really try hard to forget. I met with a lot of people to get help from them, but that could not help me. Whenever I tried to forget, I still remember. When I was in the brothel, I saw the girls coming to the brothel, and I didn’t know where they came from because I never got to talk to them. Looks like a lot of them like their work in Cambodia. So in Cambodia, the tradition is really embedded strongly in the people. They will do whatever they can to help their parents. Because of poverty, because of divorce, because of domestic violence, the girls have no choice but to enter into sex work. Even some girls are forced to work in garment factories by their parents, and the first salary they get is only forty-five dollars. They have to work another year to get fifty dollars. And that does not include the rent and daily expense. They have to work to send money to their parents. If they cannot do that, they do whatever they can. They will get a boyfriend. They will work extra hours to get money. So they do whatever they can to get money to their parents because they love their parents. That can cause them to fall into sex work without knowing. Some fall into the trick to work in brothels. Just like some are trafficked from Vietnam, are tricked to work in sex work. So there is a lot of human trafficking happening in Cambodia, and a lot are forced to work in sex work. I would be soaked with water; they would splash water all over me. They would put the electricity on a very long stick, and they would electrocute me. They would tie my hands and tie my feet, and they would splash water over me, and they would shock me. [Pointing to her forearm] So this is the scar from the shock. Because I was trying to protect myself, and I was shocked by the electricity, and it burned. So when I was shocked, and I felt like my spirit just left me and didn’t know what happened. The life in the brothel is like the life of a dog in a house. In this life I experience enough of it now. Actually more than enough. [The other women] went back to their hometown, and some have died. They have died of AIDS. I tried to look for [my friend] in different provinces, but I didn’t see her. I would try to look for her again. I met with her mother, and I asked her if she sees Giang. She said no, she hasn’t seen Giang. I don’t know if she has arrived home or not this year because her family has moved from their original place, but I will try to look for her again. ….It’s really bad for the life in a brothel, and it cannot be forgotten. So coming to the center is the start of my new life. I am able to stand to speak in the society. As you can see now I can stand, I can speak up, I can advocate for other girls. What I am very happy about is that I can stand up for other girls. I can tell others that they don’t want to do that, to do that kind of work, but there are many things that force them to do that. I want to speak to the customers that go to the brothels – don’t look at their smile but look into their eyes. Though there is a smile on their face, but look at their eyes. I talk with the Vietnamese customers, but not very much because the wall is not very thick. I asked my customers to help me to escape, but when I was finished and I came out, I was beaten. Because they eavesdropped. Because there is a lot of abuse and violence in the brothel, they would eavesdrop us and, if they hear anything, they would beat us. I told the customers that I was sold to the place, but they didn’t believe me. They even told me, “How can it be? Look at you, you look happy.” They didn’t believe me. They looked at me, saw my smile; they thought that I decided to do that. And I could not ask for a day off when I feel sick. Even an hour, when I ask the brothel owner that I was not feeling well, and I remember that it was only the first time I asked for an hour off. And when I asked – I didn’t get to rest at all. I didn’t get any rest. I got the beatings instead. That made me not want to ask them again. The only time that I could rest was when I was beaten and put in a dungeon. And the time that I got to rest was when I finished my work from five p.m. to five a.m. And that was my rest time. If I miss my grandmother, I would tap the pillow, and I would turn it over, and I hoped that I could dream of my grandmother. My grandmother used to tell me that when I want to have good dreams, I would tap the pillow and then I would have good dreams. Or if I want to see somebody I missed in the dream, I would tap and think about that person. I miss my grandmother the most. I help to rescue the girls from the provinces. Looking at my life in the brothel, if I would have been rescued earlier, I would have helped more. My work nowadays is very good and very important. I help a lot of people. . . AIDS patients. And if I see the victims, I would report to the police. My work nowadays is I can help worldwide because it is not [only] Cambodia that has fallen victim. But I want to say that victims have hurt too. No matter where they are, no matter what country they’re in, they all have pain. What I want to say to them is for them to move on, to go forward. I’m very happy with our work. I know the voice for the victims is getting stronger.  People will understand more about victims. Just like I said earlier, the previous Sinahas died. This is a different Sina; the brothel owner has shaped me. My childhood dream has been destroyed. There is only hurt and revenge. My hurt has become strength for me to help others to not fall victims like me. Up until now I cannot forget my past. No matter how far I go, it cannot be separated from me. So that is something that I can get advantage of to help others. When I help a victim, I feel very happy. I’m very happy that they are free. I’m very happy that I have destroyed the work of those people. ….. Just like I mentioned earlier, some of the victims have started a new life. They go back to their home town, they do business, but they might have some problems in their families. So I have plans, and one of them is to help strengthen families. Because the girls work alone to support their family. They will fail. So I need to help them. We need to help their families so that they can stand stronger in the society. So the second plan is for the victim group. So I want to help them to learn Khmer, English, and computer, and especially for the speaking. And they also need to learn about the law very clearly, to help them when they speak. So one of my plans is also to help victims who don’t have a goal in their life. So in our center, some of the victims don’t have a goal in their life, don’t have a family, and they don’t know where to go. They finish their studies; they don’t know where to go. And some of the victims in the victim group know how to cook. They can cook very well, but they don’t know who to cook for. Another idea is to open a fruit shop and to help the victims who don’t have a plan in their life. And the income will be used to help them. The plan is to help the victims who don’t have a goal, who don’t know where to go. Another plan is for me and for other victims. Why do I say this? Because when I go into the brothels, I see AIDS people. When they get the disease, they cannot earn money, they get kicked out. I take them to the centers that take care of AIDS patients. In our center, we don’t have money to help the AIDS patients. I always spend my own money for them. Since I have the money now, I will save some to help them because I know that the AIDS patients are very hungry. They didn’t get to eat enough when they were in the brothels. When they got the disease, they got kicked out. They didn’t get to eat enough. They got beaten. They got the disease. They got kicked out of the brothel. Looks like their life is just for torture and punishment. As a former sex worker, I would like to help them with the money until their last breath. Now we cannot do anything else to help but to get them food and to sleep well. These are my plans. I don’t know if I have enough money for that; if it’s not enough we’ll ask for more from Somaly. [smiles] I would not keep even a hundred real for myself. Because I experienced poverty in my family, and even now, it doesn’t mean that I have more than enough. But I understand that the victims really are in need. I know that I’m ok right now, and I know that it’s really, really hard for them. I know that there are a lot of good men, and there are some bad men. But through my work going to the brothels, that doesn’t make me think about getting married. Only after I came to work at Afesip, I started to talk with men, but when I was in the brothel, when I saw them I would stare at them, I would not talk with them. My dream is that I hope that there will be no more victims. I hope that the world will understand more about victims. My dream is to see that there will be no victim in Cambodia and other countries. This is my biggest dream. Everyone has four compartments in their heart. And two we can open up and share to others, and another one we can share with our families. And the other compartment is a secret place that I myself don’t know how to get into that and to share out of that compartment. I tried as much as I can, but I don’t know how to get people to understand that in that one private compartment... because it’s really hard to get into that compartment and to really make people understand. Just like I said, we all get hurt, and we all have different hurts and different depths of hurt. So some people, they get hurt in their heart, and they can get healed, but another type of hurt cannot get healed. If we get hurt over the loss of our family or relatives, then we can get over it in a few years, but then the hurt’s inside of us; there are scars in there and cannot get healed. Just like the girl we met earlier; she was sharing with us – though on the outside she looked happy, but on the inside there is much more going on that she cannot find words to describe what’s inside of her. I understood that she was feeling very hurt when she was sharing, and that’s why I asked her to stop…. The anger and vengeance cannot go away until I died and get reborn because the scars are inside of me and the hurt in me, so it can never go away. I’m not Sinaas before. I’m a different Sinanow. One Sina: Vietnamese and Cambodian. I’m the product of the people’s anger and punishment. My childhood experience, all the beatings and the torture and the punishment, and I believe they will never go away from me. If I can just get rid of it, it will be ridden from me, but I cannot. So there will never be a day that it will go away from me. What I am angriest about is why the world is full of a lot of evil people. Why good people die early and why a lot of evil people live longer. So I don’t know if there are angels in this world, good spirits, or not. Because evil people, wicked people get richer, and the good people they try their best to earn money and they never get better. We understand that some sex workers don’t have their voice. They cannot express their voice. So the Voices for Change can be the voice for the victims that can be expressed throughout the world. And we want to do that to tell the world about us, about what we experienced and about other victims. And we share our experience, the experience of trafficking, so that people are aware and know what’s going on. For me, personally, I think the Voices for Change is very important. It can be a voice to the government so that they can do something to help the victims in time. Also, internationally, they hear the voice, and they come to help. Only the victims know what their real needs are, and the first step is to show them compassion, and they do need warmth and love because they lack love and warmth in their life. My hope for them is to see them stand on their own and to help to have a family themselves, and also to help other victims. So what we want to see is that the victims can stand on their own, that they can survive, that they can stand in the society. And my hope is that the voices of the victims are heard worldwide. My hope is that the world will support them. They will support the victims, not just in Cambodia, but everywhere in the world. So we are former victims. So please help us, and without you there’s nobody to help us. ","Sina was born in Vietnam and enslaved in Cambodia, where she was forced into prostitution and drugged to become easier to control. Sina recalls that the Cambodian police, rather than help her home to Vietnam, took her to another brothel. At the time of narrating her story, she worked for the Somaly Mam Foundation as leader of its Voices for Change programme, and she reflects on both the satisfaction and difficulties of her work helping others escape their enslavement. Many Vietnamese women and children are misled by fraudulent employment opportunities and sold to brothel operators on the borders of China, Cambodia, and Laos, and elsewhere in Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. Some Vietnamese women who travel abroad for internationally brokered marriages or jobs in restaurants, massage parlors, and karaoke bars—mostly to China, Malaysia, and Singapore—are subjected to domestic servitude or forced prostitution."
Sonya,2004 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Ukraine (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"They took me to a nice house and treated me well. In the first week they gave me a tour of London. I was very happy. After a week I asked when I could start my studying. They said: “You didn’t come here for studying. We spent a lot of money on your travel to UK.” They said I have to work and give them the money back. They said I have to do prostitution. I was crying, I said, I can’t do that. I said I can do any other job to pay the money back. They were beating me and treating me very bad. The next day they took me to a flat, to work there. An Englishwoman provided me with clothes, shoes, cosmetics. The first client attended the place. I was told to go with him. I worked all day, maybe 12 hours. In the evening, someone came to collect me from the flat. She gave me an envelope with money and a list of clients and the services I gave. After that they took me to another flat. There were many girls from different countries, all Eastern European. We were sleeping on the floor, covered with coats. I was working seven days a week. Every day a different place. Sometimes there were two or three girls, sometimes eight or ten. We were not allowed to speak to each other. Some clients were English, some were Asian. I was thinking I was in London but one time a client asked me how I liked a different city. I thought, am I in this place? I was forced to pretend I’m fine and like the job, otherwise I’d be beaten. I couldn’t keep my money, not even tips, which were paid to me by clients. I was searched after every job. I was beaten on many occasions, very badly, kicked and punched. They were saying I’m illegal and they could kill me because I didn’t exist here. They said if the police checked me they would put me in prison for two years. They said I have to pay the money back. They said I’m their property, I will be with them for the rest of my life—I’m not human, just something that can be bought. I was going crazy thinking my father wanted this. I think I’ve lost my country and I can’t go back. It’s still affecting my life but I’m trying to make it work.","Sonya was trafficked from Ukraine into sex slavery in Britain in 2002, and enslaved for over two years. She was freed in 2004 by police and narrated her story the same year. Sonya’s name has been changed to protect her identity. The majority of those trafficked to the UK have been identified victims of sexual exploitation, followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation."
Sopheap,2010 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Cambodia (trafficked from),Vietnam (slavery location),"Until I was six, I lived under the care of my aunty and uncle. During the day they would all go out to work, and then when they came back at night they would always fight because they were tired from working. My aunty was very hard of hearing, and she had a terrible temper. If she could not understand what somebody said, she would just go straight away and beat them. This happened to me – sometimes my aunt and uncle would beat me very severely. My cousins also didn’t like me even though I liked them. When I was three or four years old my aunty sent me to Vietnam to be a beggar. I went with a lady who my Aunty knew, but I had never met her before. She took me on a motorbike and then a boat. There were other people going to Vietnam with us, and they were all keeping an eye on me. When we got to the river we caught a boat. I knew I was going to beg for money for my aunty. I would go begging for one month at a time, and then I would be allowed to go home again for a few days before my aunty would rent me out to another woman again. She forced me to go and beat me if I refused. I did this three times before I ran away. When I was begging some people would give me money, but some would look at me angrily or yell at me. My minders told me to say “thank you” and “food, food.” We would sleep outside. The minders would feed us and let us sleep only if we made 30000 dong. If we didn’t, then they wouldn’t let us sleep or eat. This happened a lot. Usually they made me beg at night, and during the day I had to watch the others while they begged to make sure no one ran away. I was responsible for them. If someone disappeared then I would get beaten. Sometimes one of the other children would be mischievous and hide. The first time this happened the minders forgave me, but the next time we couldn’t find a child they beat me badly. There were many other kids on the street, but only fifteen with me, all Khmer. Because they couldn’t control too many kids, there were lots of “families.” In mine, they were different ages, some older and some my age. They would say I was weak, and that they didn’t need to listen to me, and it didn’t matter if I was tortured. Once the other children were playing even though the woman minder had said we weren’t allowed to play, and I was watching them, but I fell asleep. Then the woman came back and saw us, so she took me to a secret place and beat me very seriously. And the husband minder came back and beat all the other children too. If I earned enough money I could sleep and eat, but they warned us not to try and keep any of it – they would find it and beat us. I would start work begging in the afternoon and into the night. If I got the money quickly I could get some sleep, but I would still have to get up at 4 am to beg again – even if I had made my target. It was very scary, working at night. I was afraid of being arrested, or sold again, and of having my organs stolen, especially when I had to work late into the night because I didn’t have enough money. I never got any money, but I knew my aunty got money from this woman every month. Once, when she took me home, I saw her give my aunty 100,000 dong. I told my aunty that they beat me and starved me, but she didn’t care. When I told my uncle, he said I should keep quiet or he would beat me. One day I chanced to meet a Cambodian mother who had come to Vietnam with her own child to beg. She felt sorry for me and advised me to start saving money to catch a boat back to Cambodia with her. So I worked extra hours, not sleeping and going out alone until I had 50,000 dong. I went with the lady, and it cost me 45,000 dong to come back home. When I got back to my village there was no one at my house. A neighbor saw me and said, you mustn’t stay here, they will just keep making you beg, and it is not good. Run to the commune chief’s house; he can help. So I took her advice and went to the commune chief and told him I didn’t want to beg any more or live with my Aunty, but wanted to go live in a shelter. The commune chief helped me. When my aunty found out, she scolded me. She had not told anybody how she treated me. She asked me to come home, but I refused and finally she agreed to that. Even though she did this to me, nothing has happened to my Aunty or my Uncle. I want to say to the government, please help destitute people before their poverty forces them to leave home to beg or to commit crimes. Please help them from falling into these traps, even if it’s just by giving them advice.","Sopheap was born in Cambodia and enslaved into forced begging in Vietnam, then suffered physical abuse at the hands of minders. Children from impoverished families in Cambodia are vulnerable to forced labor, often with the complicity of their families, including in domestic servitude and forced begging or street vending in Thailand and Vietnam."
Sumalee,1999 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Thailand (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Japan (slavery location),"After leaving a primary school, I helped my parents do some domestic chores and worked in the paddy field. My friend told me that she was going to work in Japan and persuaded me to go with her. I decided to go with her. But I told my mother I went to work in Bangkok.  When we arrived in Japan, the weather was so cold. An agent chose me and my friend and sent us to Tokyo. Other women were sent to rural areas. The agent told us that each of us owed him 500,000 Thai Baht ($20,000). We were taken to a bar where inside we could see thirty Thai women singing and talking to customers. A man who was in charge of the bar told me to sit with one of the customers who had already paid him 30,000 Yen ($300). After that, he ordered me to go out with that customer. Many times I saw Yakuza or the Japanese gangsters rush into the bar. One day, three of Yakuza came in and took three Thai women out. The women returned to the bar with tears. One woman had had her throat tickled with a knife and was forced to have oral sex. Another woman was forced to get into the bathtub, and then the man urinated on her face. Sometimes, while I was staying with a customer in a room, I heard my colleague screaming for help in Thai from a room near by. But my customer forbade me to do anything about it or I myself would receive the same awful treatment.  There were some women who ran away. The boss paid Yakuza to trace them and return them for punishment. They locked the woman up in a small room in which she had to sleep with any customers they commanded. If she disobeyed, she would have only one choice-death. Since arriving to work in Japan, I cried a lot although normally I did not cry easily.  One day when we were walking, two policemen came to hold our arms and asked us to show them our passports. We told them that we left them in our room but in fact, our visas had expired a long time ago. We were taken to a Police Station. There were about 200 women inside and we were investigated. Most of the Thai women had been there for two or three months. They said that they couldn't afford any air tickets so they were waiting for help from the Thai Embassy. One morning, the immigration policeman called our names telling us that we could go back home. I was so delighted but when I saw many of my fellow countrywomen who were not called crying, I felt sympathy for them but couldn't provide any help.  I was deported. After working in these conditions I arrived in Thailand empty handed. All my work, my traumatic experience, was for nothing. At present I stay with my parents and my little nephews in my village. I make my living from a small grocery and do some agriculture. All of this work requires labor, endurance and some capital. But everyone of us who was born in this world has to struggle and work hard in order to live in this world. I also give my time working on the committee for the women's group in my village. Though it is just a small thing, I hope it can be useful for the community. ","Sumalee was trafficked from Thailand to Japan in 1995, where she was forced through debt bondage into prostitution. She was able to return to Thailand after being arrested by Japanese immigration police. Some men, women, and children from Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, South America, and Africa travel to Japan for employment or fraudulent marriage and are subjected to sex trafficking. Traffickers use fraudulent marriages between foreign women and Japanese men to facilitate the entry of women into Japan for forced prostitution in bars, clubs, brothels, and massage parlors. Traffickers strictly control the movement of victims using debt bondage, threats of violence or deportation, blackmail, passport retention, and other coercive psychological methods; victims of forced prostitution sometimes also face debts upon commencement of their contracts."
Susan,2006 (Narrative date),War slavery,Uganda (trafficked from),Uganda (slavery location),"One boy tried to escape, but he was caught. They made him eat a mouthful of red pepper, and five people were beating him. His hands were tied, and then they made us, the other new captives, kill him with a stick. I felt sick. I knew this boy from before. We were from the same village. I refused to kill him and they told me they would shoot me. They pointed a gun at me, so I had to do it. The boy was asking me, ""Why are you doing this?"" I said I had no choice. I feel so bad about the things that I did.  It disturbs me so much that I inflicted death on other people. When I go home I must do some traditional rites because I have killed. I must perform these rites and cleanse myself. I still dream about the boy from my village who I killed. I see him in my dreams, and he is talking to me and saying I killed him for nothing, and I am crying.","Susan was enslaved at the age of 16 as a child soldier in Uganda, where boys and girls as young as eight years old have been kidnapped by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and forced to become child soldiers.

Tamara,2000 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from),United Arab Emirates (slavery location),"I was working as a waitress in a café. When the café closed one of the regular clients saw me in the street and said that she was going to Dubai. She said there was a lot of work in cafes, bars and restaurants where I could get a better job and salary. The proposal seemed very attractive and I agreed to go. When I went to her house I met another woman there. The woman told me that she was taking a group of women while it was easier to arrange. As I did not have money she paid the ticket for me and gave me $200 to leave behind for my family. She also took me to the hairdresser and dentist and bought me a dress. She said that I needed to look good in order to get a high salary. We traveled directly from Yerevan. All our documents had been changed. She paid the officials at the passport agency to get new passports for us, because all of us were younger than 30. One was even 17. At the airport everybody knew her, the police, customs and border guards. When we arrived in Dubai one of the women had a problem with her invitation. After a conversation of ten minutes and a phone call to some place all problems were settled and they let us out of the airport. She took us to Sharjah to a small hotel that allegedly she had completely reserved for us. We stayed there for three days. Our documents were given to the receptionist at the hotel. On the fourth day she said that she could not keep us in this hotel, as it was too expensive. She moved us to a very cheap hotel and told us to stay there and receive our clients. When I heard the word “clients” I was so surprised. I was prepared to work as a waitress. I asked the other woman what they thought about it. Nobody wanted to talk. The next day our ‘organizer’ came accompanied by an Arab man. They explained to us that we had been sold to him and if we did not do what we were told he could do with us whatever he wished. It is his country and everybody would believe him. Police or immigration officials would not accept complaints. Everybody used his services and they were all his friends. From that day on my misery started: he was sending around 50 clients a day, sometimes even more. I did not understand what was happening. I had no right to be sick, I had no right to refuse or choose. I do not know how he had established the terrible conveyor but the line did not stop. Though we lived in the same hotel with other women from Armenia who had come at the same time, we almost did not communicate. When we had couple of minutes in the morning everyone was telling the horrible situation they went through and more horrible stories of other women, especially those from Russia. They told that they had found one young beautiful girl who had committed suicide in her room. The body disappeared the same day. No police came. Next day another woman was living in her room. Nothing happened. Later our ‘boss’ always presented her example to us, telling that other pimps were so merciless. Once I got so sick that I could not even move, but the pimp wouldn’t pay attention to me and kept on sending clients to me. I do not know how I got through that day. I was feeling so hopeless that I decided to die. I thought that whatever I would tell at home, whatever kind of excuses I would offer to my parents and son, nobody would believe and forgive me. I went to the balcony, thinking that throwing myself out would solve all problems. Immediately I was called in as the next client came. If I did not get terribly sick I would never see my home. I told the pimp that I needed to see a doctor, but she said that it was very expensive and I could not afford it. The next day I was so weak that I could not even stand. I asked the receptionist to call the pimp. She came with a doctor, who said that I needed some medicines for the moment and an operation later on. I asked for my documents to go home but the pimp said that I could not go and would take care of me there. Time passed by and she kept sending more and more clients to me, so that my health condition became worse. I had no choice, I called my mother and told her to go to the house of the pimp together with police, and tell her relatives that if she did not give my passport to me in Dubai the Yerevan police would put her relatives in jail. That threat worked out, she gave me my passport and a ticket and I came back home. Once I heard that my child in Yerevan was sick. I tried to hide $100 in a piece of chocolate butter. Somebody reported me to the pimp. I was terribly beaten and my money was taken away. I thought of going again to earn some money to do an operation. I would be clever this time and would not be trapped. I have no right to be deceived again, I have a child and need to take care of him.   ","Born in Armenia, Tamara was trafficked to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where an estimated 10,000 women from sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, Iraq, Iran, and Morocco are victims of sex trafficking. In addition, victims of child camel jockey trafficking still remain in the UAE: thousands of young boys have been trafficked from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Mauritania to work as camel jockeys, and though the UAE enacted a law banning the practice in July 2005, questions persist as to the effectiveness of the ban.

Tina,2005 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"When we hear the words “Sex Trafficking,” as Americans we immediately think of women and children overseas who are being forced into the sex trade or who are brought into the United States for the purpose of sexual exploitation. We don’t usually think closer to home—Americans trafficked by Americans. But I want you to think about young women and even girls that you have seen late at night when you come home from work or a social event. Maybe you have seen them in the streets in short dresses and spike heels. You turn your heads to look away. We do not look at the faces of these young women and girls who are forced to be out in the street. Maybe we think this is what they want to do or they wouldn’t be out there. Maybe it is easier to believe that it is an empowering choice they have than face the harsh reality of child sexual abuse, physical and mental abuse, and the pimps that prey on the young women and girls. To understand all aspects of sex trafficking in the United States, you have to open your mind and let go of what you have seen or heard on television. You need to let go of the media’s portrayal of the “joys” of street prostitution, and open your eyes to the violence and control the pimps and sex traffickers exercise over their victims, who are mostly girls and young women. I was 14 years old when I was forced into prostitution. Like many teens at that age, finding my own identity and defying my parents were top on my list. So when a man came into my life and showered me with attention and listened to me when I complained about my parents, I did not think twice that he was ten years my senior. After all, he said I was mature for my age and told me I understood him better than anyone his own age. Little did I know, he was laying down the seeds of manipulation. It did not matter what my parents said, to me they did not understand me and he was the only one that “got me”. After six months, I thought I loved him, at least that is what he told me, so I did what I thought my heart was telling me and ran away to be with him. We ended up in Cleveland, Ohio. He told me we were going to meet the rest of the family. I had no idea the “family” meant myself and three other girls. After I was introduced to the “family,” I was told what my role would be. I would go out to “work” that night and bring him back the money. How else would we build our dream home? He assured me he would always love me no matter what, but he needed to know how much I loved him by making sure I would do anything for him. Later that evening, his friends came by the motel. At first, he told me to have sex with someone. I did not want to so his friends raped me. Afterwards, he said “that wouldn’t have happened if I would have just listened to him at first.” I blamed myself instead of being angry at him for being raped. I was angry at myself for not listening to him in the first place. After that, he picked my clothes out, told me what to wear, what to say, how to walk, what to say to “Johns” and how much money I was to bring back to him. He then forced me to go out into the streets. When I first went out into the streets, when I met my first John, I felt like this was something I did not want to do. I walked around the streets back and forth for hours. Finally, I got into a car because we were always being watched and I knew I had to get into a car sooner or later. Our quota was $500 and I had only made $50 that night to give back to the pimp. As a result, he beat me in front of the other girls to make an example out of me and then he made me go back out until I had made the money. This is the same man that took me out to eat, listened to me when I wanted to complain about my parents, gave me words of advice. I was now seeing a side of him that I never saw before—a brutal side where he repeatedly hit me in front of the other girls to teach us all a lesson. Not only was I shocked, I was scared. What would happen to me if I did try to leave and who would believe me if I told them what was going on? I worked from 6pm until 10pm the next night without eating or sleeping. I came back with the $500, but in his mind I still had not learned my lesson. He sent me back outside until 5am the next morning. After the second day, he finally bought me something to eat, but as a punishment to learn never to defy him again, he locked me in the closet. Since that night, I was locked in the closet on numerous occasions and had my finger broken which never set right. None of us were ever allowed to see a doctor so we endured our pain by pushing it deep down inside and trying to forget it ever happened. I can’t count the number of times people have asked me “why didn’t you just leave?” “Couldn’t you escape?” To that, I simply say “do you ask a child that is kidnapped why they didn’t try to leave?” No, we automatically say they are a victim; it wasn’t their fault. Now I know it was not my fault that a pimp manipulated a child. Under federal law, a child under 18 years who is commercially sexually abused is a victim of trafficking. However under local law a child is charged with child prostitution. The pimps who are trafficking young women and girls on the street have a great marketing tool: the media. You can turn on the TV now and see pimps glamorized in TV shows, music videos, and movies. Young people use “pimp” in everyday conversation: “my ride is pimped out,” “your clothes are pimping.” They do not understand the reality behind the term. Pimps prey on young women and girls by finding their weakness and then exploiting it. It is easier to manipulate children, and by the time children become adults, they are broken down and dependent on a pimp. After the pimp gets into your mind, it’s easy for him to maintain control, much like a domestic abuser. From then now on you have to call him “daddy” and he will punish you if he feels like you have stepped out of line. You are required to bring him $500-2000 every night. You are not a woman, you are always a “bitch” or a “ho” and are reminded of that daily. You are part of his “stable.” If you do not want to follow the rules, then he may sell you at anytime to another pimp. Polaris Project, a non-profit anti-trafficking organization in Washington DC, reported that a pimp who had three young women and girls in his “stable” were each were bringing back $500 every day. Do the math—the pimp was making about $24,000 a month or $642,000 a year tax free by selling sex with girls and young women he controlled and then keeping all the money. In the dictionary, the definition of slavery is the “state of one bound in servitude.” If someone sells you to someone else, is that not slavery? If someone forces you to do things against your will and you are not allowed to leave, is that not slavery? Then I ask you why, when pimps traffic young women and girls on the streets of America, isn’t this a form of modern-day slavery? What happened to me 15 years ago is still going on today. I now work as a Street Outreach Coordinator for Polaris Project, and I can see that it is not getting any better—it is only getting worse. We see girls and young women every night being forced onto the streets, beaten, and raped to make money for the pimps. There are organizations all over the world that work with young women and girls helping them escape from trafficking situations, I urge you to learn how you can stop sex trafficking, in the United States and overseas. To stop the problem we have to understand and help make stronger laws to get these traffickers. I hope that next time you see the young women and girls on the street; you will have more understanding of the reality of their situation. Now that you have the knowledge, what will you do with it?","Trafficked into sex slavery in 1988 at the age of 14, from her hometown of Chicago, Tina Frundt is one of many survivors who become activists after liberation. Calling herself “a voice among the many who have been unheard,” she explained in an interview that “once people are aware of this issue, they can write letters to Congress, find out what areas have a trafficking problem, and take notice when they’re coming home from a club or are out late.” As a Street Outreach Coordinator for the Trafficking Intervention Program at Polaris Project, an organization that provides services to trafficking victims, she told Congress in 2005 that “sex trafficking of U.S. citizens is a reality in every city in the United States, including right here in our nation’s Capitol. Tina added: “if we are judging the efforts of other countries to combat trafficking, we certainly must aggressively fight the trafficking of our own citizens.” Tina decided to tell her story because, as she noted in an interview, “testimony sheds light on a problem that has been going on for so long in the US. Yes, it’s going on in other countries as well, but we also need to focus on what’s been going on here in the US for years.” She knows, as she explained to Congress, that “when we see a woman on the street here in the US, we think, ‘why is she doing it? This must be her choice. She can walk away any time she wants. She can leave.’ There is less sympathy for the domestic victims.” But like foreign national victims, Tina noted, domestic victims are also moved away from their homes. “They can’t go back because they don’t know where they are or they are ashamed to tell their families of what has happened to them… How can you ask help from the police when they have done nothing but arrest you, not recognizing you are a victim of sex trafficking?”"
Valdete,2005 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Italy (slavery location) Albania (trafficked from),Greece (slavery location),"My story started because of the deep poverty in my house. We were living on my mother’s pension payment, since my father was unemployed. When I was 16 I had to go to Athens and work there for my living. There I was introduced to a guy from Fier, who first promised to marry me, but very soon cheated me and made me a prostitute. I was unlucky, living with a cruel person who treated me as a slave. I stayed with him for more than two years. During that time I was working 10-12 hours a day and he got all my profits. The first thing I experienced in the morning was beating and torture by him. He would hit me with his belt and tie me up with rope for 24 hours at a time without anything to eat. I hate him and sometimes think that his bad life made him criminal. I wanted to escape but had no other place to go. Once I did escape and spent the night at the train station on a bench. As I was tired and exhausted I fell asleep, but I got up immediately because it was so cold. Where could I go? The roads of Athens are the property of my trafficker or his friends. How can a person escape from them? When my trafficker found me, he thought that I had been working and asked me for the money. I told him I didn’t work that night because I was sick, and he didn’t wait until I even finished my sentence; he caught my hair and hit me on the sidewalk. He beat me so much that night that I couldn’t move from the bed for 15 days. So it is hard to get away from traffickers. Finally, after two years, I escaped and came back to my city in Albania to get a job, but it didn’t work well. I left Albania again, this time by a speedboat to go to Italy. There I met a guy from Vlora, who even though he exploited me as a prostitute, treated me better by giving to me half my profits. If I had a good job I would never begin the profession of a prostitute. I would even be a street cleaner, but there were no other jobs, especially for a young Albanian girl like me. You may ask, how is this thing possible in Italy and Greece? I couldn’t get any other jobs. What do you think, that once you get to Italy or Greece, they present you a long list of jobs and then ask you which one you like the best? I am telling you: there is only one job there for young girls, the most difficult one, the most humiliating thing for a girl. I have always faced two paths: to sell my youth or to turn back to Albania. But I thought, where can I go in Albania and what will I do there? My family was so poor that we were never full and satisfied. You might think it is embarrassing to be a prostitute, but to me it is embarrassing to live on somebody’s shoulders and that somebody is my paralyzed mother, who gets only 3000 lek [$31] a month. My situation and the situation of many other Albanian girls like me should make the Albanian government think and create jobs in order to employ Albanian young people in Albania. Why did they make us sell our honor abroad? And they say that Albania is going to Europe…but I saw Europe. We Albanians are going to the gap of poverty. If there was an agreement between the Albanian government and other foreign governments on immigration issues, we Albanian girls wouldn’t have become prostitutes. We sell our honor to make money, because we cannot live on 2000-3000 lek [$20-30] a month. I am feeling that this profession is making me sick. Every Albanian girl has her own mind. I don’t want to make statements, but I want to tell you that this profession of the prostitute is the dirtiest of every other profession, and every girl understands what I mean. I would never wish my fortune on anybody else.","Born in Albania, Valdete was trafficked into Greece, where Albanian victims are also trafficked in from Nigeria, and then into Italy. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply. "
Vanessa,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is Vanessa. I am 26yrs old and now live in Glasgow. People do not believe this happens…it does. I am a survivor of trafficking. I was deceived when I came to the UK and thought the trafficker was helping me. I believed I was going to be safe and have a good life here. But when I came, this was not the case. I was treated very very badly. I was locked in a room and made to have sex with many men. They would come every day and make me do things I did not want to do. These men would demand I did what they wanted as they had paid money for me. They never cared if I cried, they just carried on. Sometimes they were very rough with me, they said horrible things to me and called me ugly names. If I could say something that would stop trafficking for prostitution it would be simple…Do not allow people to buy sex. If there was no prostitution, no woman would be trafficked for this purpose. It is all about the money. Who has the money and who can make the money from selling women’s bodies. Nobody cares about the women who are trafficked to sell sex. Men don’t care, they spend their money, take what they want and carry on. The traffickers prostituted me for three months before I managed to run away and I still feel the pain now. It is in my heart and in my head. Despite the problems I have endured, I want to say that there is a happy ending to my story. I want to say thank you to TARA for helping me through the dark days when I was in crisis and giving me the strength to carry on when I believed my life was not worth living. You were there to show me how I was a good person who had bad things done to me and it was not my fault. TARA believed in me. My life has moved on so much and although I remember the dark days I no longer feel the pain so much. I am free now and building a safe life for myself. I am now employed in the Health Service and know that my life has turned around. There are still many women and girls going through what happened to me and I feel very sad for them. Please let my story be used to help stop trafficking and prostitution.","Vanessa was brought to the UK after being made false promises and forced into prostitution. She was able to escape after three months and was helped by Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), a support service in Scotland for trafficking survivors. The majority of those trafficked to the UK have been identified victims of sexual exploitation, followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation."
Wati,2009 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Singapore (slavery location) Indonesia (slavery location) Indonesia (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Wati, and I am from Indonesia…. My boss brought me come to the United States from Singapore. First I work for my boss in Indonesia, then they bring me to Singapore, then they bring me to US… They promise me at first 2500 rupiah…Indonesia money… They never paid me one penny…They locked me up for seventeen years. From 1983 until December 2000, when I escaped… They never let me out. In Singapore, yes, I could go out with the driver. The driver took me to the doctor… They gave me their children’s used clothes… I could not go back with my family… I didn’t know where they lived, and I don’t have any phone number or address… I don’t know anybody. When I got out, it was the third time I tried to escape. The first time was in Jakarta in 1990. They took me to Singapore but brought me back to Indonesia to work. My employer’s wife – she was so mean, and she always beat me up. Then one day I just jumped out the second floor window and ran away down the street to the next door. The lady who lived there said she would help me, but when I came to her, she called her housekeeper who took me to a security guard, and the security guard contacted my boss. Then they took me back to my boss. She was so mean at me, and they locked me again at the home. Sometimes they give me the day off from working but they lock me in the room, and when they come back, they use me like a machine – nonstop. Sometimes I only sleep two hours, and they would wake me up, using their foot, saying, “Get up!” They lock me up like a dog. Even when they locked me up, I couldn’t sleep good because whenever I hear a noise or the car door, my heart would pound. I could not sleep. I was always worried when they would come back. The second time in 1992 I tried to escape from a house in California. I dial 911 and the police came – the ones in the brown uniform. They came and I ran into their car and say, “I want go home.” My face was bloody because my boss just hit me and beat me up. I was so scared. But I didn’t speak English and the police didn’t understand me. My trafficker didn’t speak English either, but she call her son and her daughter who came and spoke to police. The police believe them, not me, and told me to get out of the car. When the police left, my boss threaten me and told me that I was stupid, and that the police…they would never believe me. The last time I finally escape in 2000. My boss took me to their home in Beverly Hills. They left me and locked the house and did not leave me enough food. I didn’t know when they were coming back. I was so hungry. One night, God gave me a sign, in a dream. I was so free and happy; I look and saw so many moons. When I woke up, I was still in the house and locked up. Then I was just crazy – I am banging on the door, “Please open the door! Please open the door!” I scream. Then something happened, it was like people spoke to me…“You can open the door,” and I said “No I cannot. I don’t have key. How to open door?” “Yes, you can!” the voice said. Then one day I remembered my boss daughter, she asked me to open her son’s toy. There was a screw there to put in the battery. And she told me to find some knife in the kitchen to open the screw and put the battery in…I remember that day. But the toy had a very small screw. And the screw on the door was big. I was lucky that day because my boss locked the kitchen, but I still had a table knife that I hid in case I wanted to cut some to eat. I found the knife, but it didn’t help me because it didn’t fit the screw. Then I just opened every drawer in the first floor of the house, and I found a screwdriver to fit the screw. That helped me take the lock off the door. I had already broken the lock. I said, “Oh my God, what did I do now?” Then with knife I pushed the lock over and it went “click.” And it opened. And then I said, “I hope the alarm is not on!” But I look and the light was green, not red. I remember that green is go, walk, and red is stop. I said, “Oh God, please don’t let them coming because they will kill me.” I was just so hungry. I was alone for so long. They had a statue in the house, and I remember thinking “This stupid statue…doesn’t know how to help me!” [laughter] I was so hungry, and I was so mad. I was screaming, and I just throw everything. When I left the house, the wall outside the house was three times as tall as me. How can I jump? I was screaming. Maybe some was thinking, there are crazy people next door! But nobody cared that I was screaming and crying. Then, thank God, I saw the back yard next to the swimming pool – the wall was shorter, so I jumped over two walls to get to get the street. Some people just look at me. But they no say anything. There were cars right there stopped at a red light. But they just looked at me. And then some lady with a red van saw me and asked me “Are you ok? What happened?” I just said, “Please help me call police”… in English! I don’t know...I never spoke English in my life! I don’t know how they understand me! I would always turn on television in the house when I could…on the education channel 58 and 28, and also cartoons. I think I learned some English from that. That day was so cold, and I was sick and hungry. The lady said, “Ok, you stay right there. Don’t go anywhere. I will turn my car around.” She found parking but did not get out of the car. She was waiting for the police to come. One police came with a motorcycle and talk with her. And the police kept looking at me, and the lady point at me. Then the policeman on the motorcycle came and talked to me. He asked, “What is your name? What happened? Where are you from?”  All I could say is “I hungry.” I didn’t have any food to eat. He asked me “Where you live?” I point to the house said over there…behind the wall. “You jump from there?” he ask me. “Yes…”And then he ask me if I wanted to go back inside… and I said “No, no, no!” Then three more police came, with a car and ambulance. I’m not scared, but I was cold. Then two police came and ask me if I was hungry. And I said “Yes!” And they went to the car and they both gave me their lunch. That is so nice. Gave me fruit and drink and they say, “Okay you eat first, then we talk.” I just sat there eating, and then afterward they say, “Tell me.” I said my boss lock me inside the house for many weeks and left me alone. The boss’s son came by once, but he say that he did not have time to bring food for me. They ask me where my boss was, but I didn’t want to tell them the truth, because I did not want them to make me go back to them, because I would be dead. Usually I have the phone number and address of all of their houses in San Marino, San Gabriel, La Canada, but I did not want to give them to the police, so I said I did not know. They asked me what I needed, and I said, “Please take me to immigration Indonesia.” They asked, “Do you have money? I will call a taxi for you.” I said “No, I don’t have any money. They not pay me.” “Okay,” they said, “you stay here and let us talk.” So the three people just talking, talking and talking. I thought, “Why they no do anything?” So they took me to me to the payphone and they talked to somebody on the phone. They took me to the police station and told me to stay there to wait for someone will coming from my country and they will speak my language. They gave me some towels and showed me to the bathroom, but I didn’t have a chance to go to the bathroom because the people from the Indonesian consulate came. I was so skinny – I’m like a grandma so skinny. I have a little hair, but long … The CAST social worker gave me boots and want me to use, but I’ve never used shoes. They were like high heeled boots, and I couldn’t walk in them! …. CAST helped me a lot to go to school. CAST bought a bus pass to go to school when I was at the shelter. They helped find a shelter for me and helped me with papers, like work permit, green card, everything. [With the Caucus] we learn about human trafficking and how to tell our stories. I want to tell my story from beginning to end, and maybe it can help somebody, and maybe we can go to the Indonesian news paper, something like that. I like that we are talking about how to help people and how to find new trafficking. I want to tell [others] not to believe people when they tell you that they will bring them back to their country… because it is not true. I already got my green card a few months ago. I was so happy. I no worrying anymore. Because I already get the green card, and I can now go home and visit my family. Now I need to get my passport.","Wati was enslaved in forced domestic labour between 1983 and 2000, where she was beaten and abused. She tried to escape in 1990 and 1992, and escaped successfully in 2000. She told her story to another survivor, Kanthi. Both women were part of the Survivor Advisory Caucus attached to the Coalition Against Slavery and Trafficking in Los Angeles (CAST LA)."
Yei,1999 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was caught together with my mother Abuk Acueri Yei. It was three years ago at the beginning of the rainy season. I tried to run away when the attackers came. I damaged my eye while I was running away through the bush. My master was Abdullah. He lived in a village called Acharob. Abdullah gave me the hat which I still wear. He would become very angry with me if I ever took it off. He wanted me to become a Muslim. I was called Naim, and he sent me to a khalwa, together with other slaves. I rejected my new name and didn’t like to visit the khalwa. Because of this, my master beat me severely and sent me to a cattle camp where I had to stay. Some of my master’s other slaves who had been captured before me had to wear hats too. Some of them were recruited into Murahaleen army after spending some time at the khalwa. A man who had come to visit my master pierced my ears. He accused me of not listening properly to him. My mother was also released today. She stayed with a different master and I only saw her again on my way back. One of the sub-chiefs told me that my father is around.","Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal (where the narrator was liberated) and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Ying,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United Kingdom (slavery location) China (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"My name is Ying and I am 32 years old. I was born in China but I live in Glasgow now.  My life has been full of bad luck and struggles since I was a child. My father died when I was 10.  My mother was forced by my Uncle to marry again. My step father was not a good man but life is very hard for women in China so we stayed. My mum became very sick and she had to live with my Auntie in the city so she could go to hospital.  While my mum was away from home I was raped by my step father. I was 13 years old.  When I was about 15 I was sent to live with my Auntie. My Uncle found out and asked my Auntie to take me to his house as he wanted to talk to me. Soon I found out that he arranged for me to marry. The man was much older than me. I refused but the wedding was held against my will. He raped me that night. My husband realised that I was not a virgin and complained to my Uncle. My Uncle beat me with a stick. I have nightmares about what he did to me.  My husband would beat me every day and force me to do all the house work. He treated me like I was nothing. One day he beat me up, pulled me onto the ground and dragged me around the courtyard. He cut my face with a knife. I thought I was going to die so I ran away and went back to my Auntie. During this time my Mother passed away. I think she could not cope with what was happening to me. I could not go to her funeral as I was scared of my Uncle.  I miss my Mum.  My Aunt organised for me to travel to Beijing to get away from my Uncle. I lived there for 10 years with my Aunt’s friend. Her name is Huan. This was a better time for me and I had the chance to go to school. In 2007 Huan’s sister came to visit. Her name is Mei. She offered to take me to France to have a chance of a better life. I was happy to go. I travelled to France with Mei. She paid for everything and arranged travel papers for me. I was scared to leave Huan but excited to go to France. When we got to France I began to ask Mei when I would get a job. Mei told me that my Aunt owed her a lot of money and that the only way for Huan to pay her back was for me to become a prostitute. At the beginning I refused but she slapped me, threatened to kill Huan and to throw me out of the house,  Mei told me I would go to jail if I told anyone.  I was forced to have sex with men in her house. I was expected to do anything the men asked me to do.  Sometimes I would have to see 5-6 men each day.  No one ever gave me money. One day I was very sad and one of Mei’s friends asked me what was wrong.  I trusted him because he seemed to like me. He helped me escape. He arranged travel papers for me and helped me to run away. I was so happy to escape from Mei’s house that I didn’t ask him any questions. On the day I left France he put me in a car with two other girls and a driver. I heard the man and him and the driver talking about how good sex with Chinese women is because they do as they are told and they accept everything. I was very worried when I heard them talking like that but there was nothing I could do. When we got off the boat and went through immigration no one spoke to me or the other girls. The driver did all the talking and presented all of our documents to the Immigration Officers. The driver took me to a woman’s house and dropped me off.  It turned out to be a brothel. He gave the Madam my French ID.  I don’t know where he took the other girls. There were many different girls in that place but I wasn’t allowed to talk to them. The Madam told me that I had to pay back what she had paid for me. She told me I would do this by having sex with men for money. She said that when this debt was paid I would be able to keep some money for myself. She told me that if I refused that she would tell the police who would put me in prison and then send me home to my Uncle.  I don’t know how she knew about him. The only time I was allowed out was to buy clothes or have my hair done but I was always accompanied by another girl. I was always scared that the police would catch me as I didn’t have any papers and I was ashamed that I was a prostitute. I was kept there for a few more months but I never seemed to manage to pay off the debt. One day the madam said that she was sending me to Glasgow to help one of her friends care for her children. I was happy because I thought that I would not have to have sex with men any more. She gave me my ID but told to me give it to her friend so she could keep it safe. I hid it instead and pretended I had lost it. I was put on the bus and her friend was waiting for me at the bus station in Glasgow. The friend turned out to be a madam too and, again, I was forced to have sex with men. Sometimes the men gave me tips which I saved so I could buy a bus ticket to France. This took me a long time. I began to be allowed out to the shops and one day I ran away and managed to find the Scottish Refugee Council who referred me to TARA. I was very upset speaking to them at first because I had to explain what had happened to me. I find it very difficult to talk about my past experiences but my worker has helped.  She listens to me and believes me. I talk with her and this makes me feel better because I know she doesn’t judge me.  I haven’t trusted anyone to do this for a long time. I feel safer now. They helped me to find a solicitor to help me claim asylum and talk to me about the National Referral Mechanism. TARA also helped me to speak to the Police. I was so relieved that TARA, my solicitor and the Police believed me and that I wasn’t in any trouble. I still find it very hard to concentrate and my memory is not good but I am going to college and trying to learn English. It is very hard to focus on studying when I have all these bad memories in my head. I am happy that I can study and my worker encourages me to go out, meet with new people and make some friends. I managed to make a friend in college. My worker helped me to meet with a lady Psychologist and now I am trying to make sense of what happened to me and deal with my past. I see them both every week.  They keep on reassuring me that I am not on my own that I have support around me and this is so important for me I still have nightmares nearly every night and migraines but I no longer have thoughts to kill myself. My sleep is not good because of the nightmares and I keep on thinking about the abuse I suffered. I pray a lot. I consider myself lucky to have come to Scotland and to have support. Although it is still hard for me and I am terrified of what will happen to me in the future I have hope that my life will become better.","Ying was forced into prostitution after she was trafficked to France, and then to the UK. She was able to escape and was helped by Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), a support service in Scotland for trafficking survivors. The majority of those trafficked to the UK have been identified victims of sexual exploitation, followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation."
Ying A.,2004 (Narrative date),Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I was imprisoned between November 2000 and November 2001 for refusing to give up Falun Gong practice. During that period of time, I was held in servitude at the Beijing Tuanhe Prisoner Dispatch Center and the Beijing Xin’an Forced Labor Camp in Beijing. While there, I was forced to do slave labor. I was forced to make various types of slave labor products. Products Made  (1) Beijing Tuanhe Prisoner Dispatch Center (a) Packaged large quantities of disposable chopsticks. Most of them are being used in restaurants and hotels while some are being exported.  (b) Made “Florance Gift Package.” (2) Beijing Xin’an Labor Camp (a) Packaged large quantities of disposable chopsticks. Most of them are being used in restaurants and hotels while some of them are being exported.  (b) Knitted sweaters.  (c) Knitted woolen gloves (60 Yuan per pair, exported to Europe). (d) Crocheted cushions for tea sets.  (e) Crocheted hats for a company at Qinghe Township, Beijing. Knitted seat cushions.  (f) Re-processed sweaters; removed sundries from yarn.  (g) Made large quantities of slippers. The job was mainly gluing the sole and the instep together, and the labor camp demanded a high quality product. When I was there, it was the hottest time of the summer. Many practitioners and I were working in our prison cells. Working in a humid prison cell full of irritating glue odors was suffocating. We worked until midnight or one o’clock in the morning every time there was a shipment.  (h) Made stuffed animals such as rabbits, bears, dolphins, and penguins, etc. Major steps included putting the stuffing material inside, stitching the doll together, sewing the eyes, and stitching the mouth, etc. The Sanitation and Living Conditions of the Forced Labor Camp  (1) Beijing Tuanhe Prisoner Dispatch Center I was locked up with over a dozen Falun Gong practitioners in a cell that was about 12 square meters (130 square feet) in size. There were only eight bunk beds in the room; thus, some of us had to sleep on the floor. While we were sleeping, we had to keep our heads visible to the guards. We did everything in this cell including working, eating, drinking, and using the toilet; therefore, there were many flies and mosquitoes. At the dispatch center, we were only allowed to eat at certain times. Water was rationed; drinking water was limited. The prison guards never allowed us to wash our hands before meals. After a meal, we had to get back to work immediately. Twice a day, we were given five minutes for personal hygiene. When the time was up, we were forced to stop and drain the water. We were not allowed to take any water back to our cell. If we could not finish the work assigned to us, we were not allowed to clean ourselves. When there was a rush to get products out, we had to work late and go to sleep without washing. There were fixed times for the whole group of practitioners to go and use the toilet. Even then, we still had to ask for permission from the guards. We were allowed two minutes to use the toilet each time; thus, many people did not even have enough time to have a bowel movement. Those who had constipation could only have bowel movements several times a month. We could go to bed only at the specified time; otherwise, we would be scolded and not allowed to sleep. At night, the guards locked up all the cells; a small bucket in each cell was used for a toilet. We were watched even during sleep. Several times, I was woken up because I propped up my legs while I was sleeping. They thought I was doing Falun Gong exercises, so I had to keep my legs flat. We were allowed very little sleep each day; we were forced to start working the moment we opened our eyes. My hands had blisters and thick calluses from working long hours to finish the assigned quota of packaging disposable chopsticks. I often worked until midnight. We were not allowed to sleep unless we finished the quota. We were forced to work over 16 hours every day, and everything was done in our cells where we eat, drink, sleep and use the toilet. The sanitation condition was extremely poor. Even though we were packaging disposable chopsticks and the label said the chopsticks were disinfected at a high temperature, the entire process was unhygienic. We could not wash our hands, and we had to package those chopsticks that had fallen on the floor. In order to seek a huge profit, Tuanhe Prisoner Dispatch Center and Tuanhe Labor Camp disregarded the health of the general public and knowingly committed such wrongdoings. Many restaurants in Beijing are currently using these chopsticks. I heard they are even being exported. Many female practitioners were usually forced outside; all of their clothes were taken away and they stood outside, naked, for a long period of time. In the winter, some practitioners were forced to freeze outside until they lost consciousness. During these long-term tribulations, I finally reached the limit of my endurance. I signed a guarantee that I would not practice the exercises. The pain of giving up one’s own belief and being transformed cannot be described in words. The next day I cried all day long. Female practitioners are forced to perform excessive physical labor. We were forced to unload trucks full of bagged materials that weigh over 100 pounds each. We had to carry the bags on our shoulders from the truck to our cells. Other physical labors included digging pits, planting trees, and transporting fertilizers. The police exploited our labor to create illegal income for themselves. The dispatch center did not compensate us for any of our work. In fact, we were forced to do long and hard labor without any compensation. (2) Beijing Xin’an Labor Camp Both our bodies and minds were imprisoned and severely persecuted under the excessive workload. The police often kept us from sleeping at regular hours. When there were work orders, we had to work day and night to produce the best product with the shortest amount of time. The police even said, “You are trying to be good people, you should do the best under every circumstance.” The torture and inhuman treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by policemen is widespread and serious. While in prison, the first thing they have to do is take off all of their clothes in public and have iced water poured all over them. Everyone has to go through this severe routine, including menstruating women. This may cause them to later have problems when giving birth, but the policemen didn’t care. All the work in the labor camp is labor intensive. Falun Gong practitioners are forced to work until midnight under dim lights, and everyone has a quota to meet. If a practitioner cannot finish the quota, he/she is not allowed to sleep. One time we were making gift items…knitted products and crocheted cushions. In order to meet the shipping deadline, we were forced to work in the hallway or lavatories until one or two o’clock in the morning; we sometimes worked through the whole night. The police used this method to control our thoughts. They would not let us have a single moment of idle time to think calmly, and we were not allowed to talk to each other. They had drug addicts and ex-practitioners monitoring us. They only wanted us to work. In order to evade people’s attention, the labor camp required us to sleep on time every night. We got up very early in the morning to work. During summer time, our cells were so hot that people sometimes collapsed from heat exhaustion. Many practitioners developed symptoms of hypertension and heart disease from overwork. Their entire bodies twitched. We had to say “Report, yes” loudly whenever going in and out of the jail cells. If the sound wasn’t loud enough, we would be punished by being forced to shout 100 times at the wall. Then we had to lift our legs up at a 90 degree angle while walking and then stamp down with all our strength. Before eating, we had to kneel down on the ground, hold the bowl over our head and shout loudly, “Reporting to the leader, prisoner XXX asks to have her meal.” Once they handcuffed me to the window and forcibly injected medicine into my left arm. When the medicine got into my bloodstream, I felt severe pain in my heart, and then my heartbeat sped up and beat severely. Every heartbeat felt like it would cause my heart to explode. After that, I clearly felt that I was having difficulty thinking. My reactions and memory became dull. My left side also twitched frequently and it became more and more fierce. What we were fed in jails and labor camps may have had medicines mixed in. The food smelled strange. After eating it we would feel like throwing up, and we would become very drowsy. In addition, there was brutal beating and torture. Once they beat me so badly that the prisoners who watched the beating cried and asked the policemen to stop beating me. With some kind hearted people’s help, I was eventually able to leave China. I often ask myself: I only want to follow the standard of “Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance” to be a good person, but they forced me to change from a respectable person to an accomplice who persecuted my fellow practitioners. It is Falun Gong that will save me once again.","Unknown numbers of people have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps). Human rights organizations claim that Falon Gong practitioners are often targeted for arrest, along with ethnic minorities, Catholics, Protestants, and Tibetans. By some estimates around 100,000 Falon Gong practitioners have been sent to the Laogai. Ying was one of these individuals. A student in France, she was imprisoned in 2000 while visiting her family in China. "
Zamira,2005 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Albania (trafficked from),Belgium (slavery location),"When I was a senior in high school here in Tirana, I met a boy who did not go to my school. He was kind, attractive, and treated me well. After a time, we fell in love with each other—or so I thought at the time. He was my ‘first love,’ and I hadn’t had much experience with boys romantically prior to that. After dating for a time, he convinced me to go to Belgium with him. He said that he could get a good job there and told me about what a wonderful place it was: how clean, how beautiful, and how many opportunities there would be there for us. He proposed to me, and our plan was to leave Albania illegally (since we would not qualify for visas) and get married once he found work there. I was in love, and I believed him. Once we got to Belgium, however, he totally changed. He became abusive of me and violated me many times. He threatened my life and the lives of my family members. I did not speak the language there and was totally dependent on him; I had nowhere else to go and was afraid. He trafficked me for six months. I don’t want to talk anymore about that time. It was the worst period in my life. It is now in my past, and I have closed that door behind me. I was able to find a shelter there with people to help me return to Albania. I wanted to return to my family here, but my father would not accept me and was abusive of me and my mother. My mother decided to leave my father to help me, even though this is something unheard of in Albania for a woman to leave her husband. Women here can’t really find work to support themselves and have to rely on their fathers or husbands for their livelihood. My mother gave up everything for me, and for this I am grateful. After living in the shelter for as long as we were allowed, my mother and I are now living together and trying to support ourselves.  ","Born in Albania, Zamira was trafficked into Belgium, where by some estimates Albanian girls aged 14 and 15 make up nearly half of the foreign women forced into prostitution. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply."
Zipora,2007 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Tanzania (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Zipora Mazengo, and I am twenty-seven years old. I came to the United States from Tanzania in June 2000 to work for a diplomat and his family. The diplomat is also from Tanzania. His name is Alan Mzengi. He still serves at the Tanzanian Embassy. I worked for the Mzengis for four years as a nanny and a housekeeper. And they never paid me.  I came to the United States legally on a special visa, one that diplomats can get to bring over nannies and domestic workers. The Mzengis sent me a contract in Tanzania. The contract promised that I would earn $900 per month. The contract said that I would get two weeks vacation each year. And the contract said that I would get two days off each week. I signed the contract and went with Mrs. Mzengi’s grandfather to the U.S. Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam to get a visa. The officials at the embassy looked at the contract and asked Mrs. Mzengi’s grandfather questions in English. I did not understand English and did not answer any questions. I flew to the United States alone. When I arrived, Mr. Mzengi met me at the airport and immediately took my passport and contract away from me. He held my passport for four years, until I escaped in 2004. I worked for the Mzengis in their large house in Gaithersburg. I had to clean the whole house, cook, do the laundry, and take care of the three children. I worked sixteen hours each day: from 6 in the morning until 10:30 each night, every day. My contract had said that I would earn $900 each month. But the Mzengis never paid me. When I asked the Mzengis for my wages, they said they would hurt me and send me home. My contract said that I would have two weeks vacation each year and two days off each week, but I never had a single day off. I was not permitted to leave the house. My contract made it seem like I would have a good job. But when I made any mistakes, Mrs. Mzengi would scream at me. Once when I did not prepare her breakfast, she hit me on the face and sent me out in my summer clothes to stand outside in the snow. She told me that if I complained, ‘‘blood would fall on the floor.’’ My contract said that I would receive medical care. But when my toes became infected, the Mzengis did not take me to a doctor. My feet bled, and I could not wear shoes. But Mr. Mzengi made me go outside to shovel snow in my bare feet. Finally, two years after the infection began, Mrs. Mzengi took me to a doctor, and I had surgery in the doctor’s office. My contract was full of lies. A Good Samaritan helped me escape from the Mzengis’ home, and she found a lawyer for me at CASA of Maryland. My lawyer, Elizabeth Keyes, helped me to get a T-visa. My lawyer wrote to the Tanzanian Ambassador and the U.S. Department of State. The Embassy of Tanzania ignored me, and did not help me to get my wages. The Department of State did not help me. In 2006, my lawyer asked the Diplomatic Security Services at the Department of State to begin an investigation, but they did not. In November 2006, my lawyers arranged for me to meet with a prosecutor at the Department of Justice. He began an investigation of the Mzengis and I cooperated in the investigation. But nothing has happened to Mr. Mzengi or Mrs. Mzengi.  In April 2007, my lawyers filed a lawsuit against Mr. and Mrs. Mzengi for trafficking me to the United States and forcing me to work for four years without any wages. I still have not received any money. The Mzengis have ignored the lawsuit. I agreed to come today to speak with you because I do not want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. The Mzengis kept me in their home for four years, and forced me to work day and night without ever paying me. They stole my passport from me. They stole my freedom from me. They stole four years of my life. But the Mzengis are free. They have not been punished. And they have not paid. I want justice for me. But I also want to stop diplomats from exploiting other people in this way. It is wrong.","Zipora was enslaved as a domestic servant in the United States by a diplomat and his family, who beat her and failed to meet the terms of the contract originally agreed upon. When she required medical care, they refused to provide it for 2 years. It was the actions of a stranger that helped her out of her enslavement and to get a T-visa, a special visa status for victims of trafficking. In 2007 Zipora filed a suit against her captors."
Affoué,2012 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Ivory Coast (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"We had enough to eat, our parents took care of us, we went to school, until one day my father said I was to go to Europe to study. I was 15 at the time. The papers were taken care of, we got the tickets and they took me to Abidjan, to Houphouët-Boigny airport. A lady and gentleman were waiting for me. All these years that I stayed with them I did everything. I had to wake up to prepare breakfast when the lady left at 5am and make the gentleman's sandwich to take to work. Once I'd taken care of the parents I took care of the children. I woke them, got them ready, gave them breakfast, take them to school and do the shopping. I cleaned the house and prepared the children's lunch, took them back to school. If there were more chores, I did them and also cooked dinner. Sometimes they even woke me to wash the gentleman's car. I had no clothes of my own. I wore the lady's clothes when they no longer fitted her or sometimes clothes from her friends. They used to say, ""if you go out, don't tell anyone you have no papers."" I lived in constant fear. Whenever they said to do something, I did it. And if I didn't I was told off. As time went by it got worse. When I went to bed I had nothing but nightmares. I had nightmares all the time. I slept in a cubbyhole. The oldest boy slept with me in the cubbyhole. When I laid down, my feet were going up. The cubbyhole was really small. I wasn't getting any money because she said they were keeping the money in the bank for me. On 24 March 2003 or 2004, they said ""Affoué, we need your travel authorization."" I said, ""what's that?"" but they didn't want to say. It means that once they buy you a plane ticket and you go there, you can't come back. If I was going to leave, they had to give me everything they had promised me. That's when they said no, we never said anything about money in the bank for you. I started to rebel. Little by little, I understood with the help of friends and neighbours that I had to take things in my own hands. I stayed for 12 years, until I was 27. I felt so very hurt and betrayed. Betrayed because for years I sacrificed myself for them and I got nothing in return. Every time I think about the wrong they've done me I feel angry, but then I think anger doesn't help. You have to move forward. Today I have a beautiful baby boy who makes me happy. I feel like a woman, like a mother. Life goes on. Life goes on. Life is beautiful. Life is short but it's beautiful, and you have to enjoy it. My advice would be that human beings have to stop harming their fellow humans, that slavery has to end. We are all human beings, we are all equal. It has to end. It's wrong to take other people's children and exploit them. It's wrong, and so it has to stop.  ","In France, women and children are being subjected to domestic servitude, in cases in which families exploit relatives brought from Africa to work in their households. Trafficking networks have expanded to operate in large towns outside of Paris, including Lille, Marseille, Chartres, Toulouse, and Nice. Affoué was taken from the Ivory Coast and exploited for 12 years under domestic servitude in France without pay or a day off. She eventually escaped with the help of a French NGO, and now she is moving forward with her life, together with her son."
Agnès,2012 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Ivory Coast (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"I arrived in France through a lady my brother said would help me. I had lost my parents. My brother was still young and going to school so he couldn’t take care of me. The lady’s daughter came for a holiday and the lady introduced us. She said, “This is my daughter. She will take you with her. You’ll mind her children and she’ll send you to school.” I had just turned 18. All the time I was with her, I minded her children, but she never made good on her promise. I took care of the children, washed them. I cooked, I cleaned, everything. I never went out because I wasn’t allowed. I couldn’t talk to people, even the neighbours. She didn’t pay me. One day, she said to me, “Get your things together, we’re going back to Abidjan.” I didn’t want to go because she hadn’t helped me. Sending me back to Abidjan there was no one there for me. For three years I worked, kept her children and for three years, she did nothing. It’s really painful. Now, I feel even though it’s hard, but I prefer this. I prefer this than to stay in such a situation.","In France, women and children are being subjected to domestic servitude, in cases in which families exploit relatives brought from Africa to work in their households.

Ah Jing,2011 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,China (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I met those snakeheads [in Sichuan] when I was homeless. I owed them money and they lied to me that they could find me a job in the UK, so I could earn money to pay them back. When I got to the UK I was controlled by them. ... It didn’t matter how much money I owed them, they said they had ways to let me pay for the money I owed. They knew people like me would not have much money, but what they wanted was to set me to pay the money in their way. You had no other choice other than to believe them [snakeheads]. Because they got money from helping me go abroad, if I had a job I could pay them back. So no matter how difficult it was I would still be willing to do so, even if I had to pay them all the money I had. Because I owed them money I had to do things I didn’t want to do, something like prostitution. I fought against it by not eating any food. ... They started to treat me badly because I didn’t do what I was told. I would use some extreme ways to protest, like threatening to kill myself using a knife. ... If they took people in and forced me [to have sex] I told them I would kill myself. They had no choice, because if I died they would lose everything.  They just told me to pack my bags and go with them. They took me to a place and told me to get out of the car. Then they said I still had to pay them back the money, but because I was pregnant they just let me go till I gave birth. They warned me not to say anything to anyone. They would take revenge if I said something. They said they knew how to find me and take revenge on me. So I didn’t say anything about the snakeheads when I was interviewed by the Home Office staff.","Ah Jing’s parents were arrested for practising Falun Gong when she was seven or eight years old. In China she had been homeless, fending for herself, earning a meagre living trading scrap paper, cardboard, cans, bottles, jars and books. When she was 16, she borrowed some money from some snakeheads who then told her they could find her work in the UK, so that she could repay what she owed. Before she left China Ah Jing owed ¥100,000 to the snakeheads: on arrival in the UK she owed a further ¥170,000, making ¥270,000 in total. Ah Jing had willingly left her hard life in China, where she had no identity papers, money or home. Once she was in the UK, her debts had increased and she was pressurised into sex work, which she resisted. She was raped by a snakehead and became pregnant. As she was no further use as a sex worker, she was released with threats that if she told anyone about her ordeal, they would take revenge."
Ah Wang,2011 (Narrative date),Trafficking,China (trafficked from),Russia (slavery location),"They told me that I would go straight to the UK. My visa was for going to Russia, because they said I could go straight to the UK from Russia. But it turned out it was a lie. They promised me the journey would be easy and safe and simple, and we would go there by plane. It turned out differently when we arrived in Russia but we couldn’t argue with them. The snakeheads lied to us. When we arrived in Russia our passports were taken away by them. They gave us no choice except to follow their instructions. We had no freedom. We were kept in a place and not allowed to go out. But even if we could have gone out we were scared of getting lost and not being able to speak the language. If the snakeheads told us we were leaving tomorrow then we would just pack our bags and the next day we’d be gone. I was really scared throughout the journey because I didn’t know where I would be the next day. I couldn’t do anything except follow the snakeheads. You might have a nice snakehead in one place but a very nasty one in the next place. The people who took us across the borders weren’t always good, some of them took our valuables. ... Because I was controlled by them I couldn’t go back. I couldn’t even escape because I didn’t know where I was going to.  ","Ah Wang left China when he was 28, seven years ago. His wife stayed behind while he saw what life was like in the UK. He was misled by the snakeheads arranging his trip, and faced a difficult journey. Ah Wang travelled across countries by car but ‘needed to climb mountains when entering the borders because we had no passports.’ Local guides, part of the snakehead chain, would guide them across borders. They ended up staying in some places for up to a month while the next stages of the journey were planned. The journey ended up taking about a year. When Ah Wang eventually arrived in the UK by boat he was arrested by the police but was released soon after. He thought he had applied for asylum at that time, but several years later discovered that there was no record of his claim. "
Aleta,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Our Community,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Aleta. From the time I was born I labelled myself as a disgrace because I was born as a result of my parent’s extramarital affair. My father did not want me to be born and when I was born he denied that I was his daughter. When I first learnt of this my heart was so heavy as if a bomb had been dropped. My mother wanted to keep me but after a few months she was forced to leave me in the care of relatives. The two women who cared for me I considered my parents. They were lesbians and they loved me as if I was their own child. We lived in the rural area of Cebu. When I was five, my parents sent me on an errand to the neighbours’ house. The neighbours had two boys and when I went into their house they took off my dress and they raped me. When they were doing it I just stared at them and I didn’t say anything. I was motionless and when I came home, all I can recall is I had blood in my panties. I did not tell anyone of that incident. Soon after, we relocated to Cebu City and I attended school. My behaviour at school and home was very bad. I was very rebellious and I became a problem for my parents. During that time I got to know a distant cousin who we depended on a lot for income. She would come home at 3am and bring me lots of junk food. I never knew at that time that she was a prostitute. My parents and I lived with her and her live-in partner and their baby, who I looked after. One time, I was putting the baby to sleep and the husband of my cousin came into the room. I was so shocked to see him there. He told me to be silent and he raped me. After, he insisted I tell no one. After that rape incident I could not look that man in the eye, I felt ashamed. The family of that man depended on my cousin’s income for their living. They quarrelled. One time I interrupted, saying, “You should be the one working, not my ate [a term used to describe a respected older woman],” so he grabbed my head and pushed it into the ground and physically abused me. At nine years old I was being nagged at by my parents and my cousin who accused me of bad things so I just ran away, which led me to being trafficked. If I could relive my childhood I would have a very simple wish. First I would want to get the attention of my mother and have better communication. Those times when we had no contact would be patched up with love and care between mother and daughter. The second wish would be to play. I had no time to play and I would like to have had plenty of toys.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates.

Alma,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"I walk along the streets in Olongapo City where scantily clad women pose outside entertainment clubs and beckon passersby to come inside for a “good time.” I enter one of the “videoke bars,” and find myself in a dimly lit den where foreign businessmen and locals watch inebriated women gyrate on a stage. From the bar, I watch a Westerner buy another drink from a young Filipina whose language he does not speak. If the man wants to buy her for sex, he will pay the bar owner a fee called a “bar fine.”  Looking at this young girl, I wonder how she ended up here. I wonder if she will take her customer to a back room in the bar or to her home and risk waking up any children she might have. I wonder if she’s ever been beaten or raped by her customers. Or, if she ever had to contact a “hilot” (midwife) who terminates unwanted pregnancies by violently pounding a woman’s stomach until she miscarries. When the customer leaves to use the bathroom, I approach the girl who looks surprised and a little annoyed that I’ve intruded on her personal space. Undeterred, I tell her that I work for an organization called Buklod. “We bring women together to discuss their lives and share ideas,” I say. “You should come to our next meeting.” She looks at me quizzically and asks, “What do you know about my life?” In 1984, Olongapo City was a thriving U.S. military base and my name was not Alma but “Pearly.” I was a single-mother of two young children struggling to support my family by waitressing seven days a week. The clubs were always busy when the military ships came in. As a child I dreamed of becoming an accountant. When my brother promised to help pay my tuition, I left Manila for Olongapo City where he lived. Once I arrived though, he admitted that he had no intention of helping me attend college. Instead, he hoped I would “strike it lucky” and marry an American serviceman so I could support our family. After a few months there, I grew frustrated by the lack of jobs and finally agreed to waitress near the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay. My brother tried to force me to accompany the servicemen when they requested my company, but I refused. One day, a serviceman offered the manager a “bar-fine” for me. I refused, saying that I was just a waitress. The manager told me that if I didn’t go, I would lose my job. He threatened to withhold my transfer documents, papers releasing me from his employment and allowing me to work elsewhere. I was scared that my children and I would end up homeless and hungry, so I reluctantly agreed. The American wanted to rent a hotel room, but I told him to give me the money he would spend on a room and accompany me home instead. I sent my children to my parents because I did not want them to see what their mother was doing to make a living. I tried to avoid doing this again, but my daughter fell ill and I needed money for her medical expenses. During my four years at the club, I had about 30 American “boyfriends.”  In the early 1980s, there were no health programs and nobody knew how to use contraceptives. The Amer-Asian child population boomed. I gave birth to my third child knowing he would never meet his father. Around that time, we started hearing about AIDS. The American guys would line up for condoms before disembarking their ships. However, some of them would just blow the condoms into balloons and toss them around. We couldn’t require a customer to use a condom because he would say, “I paid good money” and get his way. In 1984, I befriended an American woman named Brenda Proudfoot, who was helping women escape prostitution and sex trafficking. She invited me to join a support group where I met others in similar situations. After several meetings I knew this was my chance to finally exit the hellish world of prostitution. In 1987, I co-founded Buklod ng Kababaihan and spoke with women at the bars about our services. My employer grew frustrated with my absences, but I felt so empowered that I continued speaking out against injustices at work. I now knew my rights as a woman and a human being, and was unwilling to compromise any longer. My employer fired me, calling me “a Communist.” I was unable to find another job because he withheld my transfer permit, but thankfully, Buklod hired me as an organizer. The salary was low, but I jumped at the opportunity. I was so happy to be free from prostitution. Society’s understanding of human trafficking and prostitution needs to change. In my country, people believe that prostitutes are criminals and buyers are the victims. This is wrong. When women are not given equal opportunities for employment or education, their options are limited and they grow desperate. Because women are often viewed as powerless sex objects they are constantly driven into the sex industry. At times, I too believed that I only existed for men’s pleasure. Filipina women are often referred to as “little brown fucking machines” by servicemen. Once I asked a customer, “Why do you like Filipina women so much?” He replied, “Because the women are cheap, way cheaper than Japanese women. And besides, you can do what you like. Here the women are always smiling. They pretend that they like it.”  We need to change this thinking and educate young girls about the abuses of the sex industry, to let them know that they do have choices. Women are human beings, not commodities to be bought and sold. As I leave the videoke bar, I’m unsure if the young woman will attend our next meeting. She is one of thousands of prostituted Filipina women. The sex industry is a huge machine, and it’s not easy to stop. As one survivor to another, I try to communicate that I understand their fears and pain. I try to tell my sisters that Buklod is trying to create a different future.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Alma’s story highlights how survivors can use their experiences and knowledge in the fight against slavery and exploitation. Alma works not only to help women to freedom but to change the culture around prostitution, which often works to criminalize and delegitimize the women who are exploited within the industry, while protecting those who exploit."
Amaya,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"My real father passed away and my mom remarried. She needed to work day and night to earn money to provide for us. My family life went downhill. Sometimes we didn’t have food to eat. I felt so disappointed and had lots of questions. Why did my life turn worse and worse just like falling into a pit? Why was my family situation so terrible? We did not have any money even though we worked so hard. There were two dreams – I wanted to have a hair salon and become a pop singer. One day a relative of mine was drunk and raped me. I felt angry and afraid. During that time I kept the rape a secret. I was full of shame and did not know how to explain it to anyone. I could not tell my mum what had happened – I was so ashamed I went to live with a friend. She brought me to work in a place without telling me what kind of job it was. I was brought to a brothel. I felt depressed and thought, why do only bad things not good things happen in my life? One day a group of clients raped me in a graveyard. They left me alone there and I felt like an animal. I returned to work to serve customers as I was told. Later, I always cried in front of my customers. I felt that my life was like a doormat for others to step on and manipulate me. Later on there was a group of police who came to rescue me and many other exploited girls. They spoke to us without respect at all. Instead they called us bitches – they spoke really painful words to us. When I was brought to Hope for Justice on the first day I felt so excited and happy. The atmosphere was like a family which made me feel warm. I wanted others to know that this is the best place that can wake you up from the bad dream and help you return to a good life. I want girls who come here in future to learn from my example.","Cambodia was renowned as a sex tourism destination in the 1990s and this legacy is still prevalent today with women and girls trafficked within the thriving sex industry in Cambodia's major cities. Despite significant attempts to curb CSE, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels. Boys and young men are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation, with many entering the massage industry due to a lack of training and skills. Amaya’s story demonstrates that family problems and child abuse can lead to children turning to those who would sell or exploit them. After Amaya was rescued by the police she was referred to Hope for Justice and began her rehabilitation program. She worked through her trauma and began healing from the pain of her past. She began to discover a new dream for her future."
Anastasia,2008 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Domestic slavery,Domestic slavery,South Eastern Europe (slavery location),"In 2002, my older sister married and moved to her own home and I was left alone with my parents. It was very hard for me. I had to keep the house by myself because my mother is an alcoholic and used to go away from home for days. My father is very strict and I had to learn how to cook, to wash, to do everything in the household, while my father worked in the field. Starting with the age of 16 my life turned to disaster. We had no money for bread but a lot of small debts to neighbours. My mother started pressuring me to go to the city and ask friends for money. Meanwhile, I met another girl who, at the disco, introduced me to all kinds of boys. All the money I earned was brought home and the entire family lived on it. My mother pretended to know nothing. But she did not ask me where the money was coming from, when should it be paid back, etc. And instead, she put pressure on me to bring more. I’ve been working since I was a little girl and I’ve tried to do everything for my parents to love me. At 12 years old I was doing everything that needs to be done in the house, I was taking care of my brothers and sisters. My mother was ill. She had a caesarean operation and didn’t do anything anymore. My youngest brother was ill and my mother stayed with him in the hospital, so I cooked, I washed the clothes and the children, I cleaned. Even the neighbours in the apartment building noticed and wondered how I could keep the house for the entire family. My father would call them (business owners) on the phone and I had to go and collect the money. Or, my father would call the priests and they allowed me to beg in front of the church... I also did all the chores in the household because my mother came tired from work and all she did was cook. I was doing all the rest and I was taking care of the little one, too. And when I came with the money, my father used to give me a beating and say that it was short, that I had stolen some for sure. And my mother would let him. She was just like him. If he didn’t start a fight, she would start it. [While living in a Western country] My mother said she was ill, my father [an invalid] was begging sometimes, and I was working selling newspapers. We found all kinds of supplies in garbage cans. My mother went to the cans only when my father made her... Life was so bad...Until one evening when my father told me to go and make money, to walk the street. I refused and my mother said to me to come to my senses and they both trashed me with a crowbar.","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation.

She was 33-year-old and she was bringing her boyfriends in her flat, but she didn’t allow them to touch me, saying that I was too young. They took my friend by force to work in a bar. She advised them to take me as well, which is what happened. In that café, we stayed for two days, and afterwards the police came there and since we didn’t possess any documents, they sent us to the police station. They sent us to a shelter. And then, we were sent to the court, where we testified against the owner of the bar. In the shelter, I met one of my friends who told me that she had a boutique of clothes and she could employ me there. But in the meantime, she left the shelter. I disliked everything in that shelter and I made the request to the custodians to leave that place. They told me if I want to leave, the only thing I had to do is to sign a paper. I did so and left the shelter. I was 16 at that time. After leaving the shelter, I paid a visit to a café and met the girl whom I knew from the shelter. She was accompanied by two men. They took us with them saying that they got me a job in a shop, but when we arrived there I saw that it was a bar. One week after, the owner of the bar started to beat me and bring the clients to me. He was selling me for money. This lasted for one month and a half, until my brother in law visited that place and saw me. He informed the police. The police came and got me out and sent me to a shelter.

Angel,2015 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Tanzania (trafficked from),Tanzania (slavery location),"I made a long journey from being exploited and abused as a child, working 16 hours a day for next to nothing, to claiming my rights and now advocating on behalf of others. I was brought up by my mother in a small town in Tanzania. Sadly, she died when I was 16 and my father just wanted to marry me off as soon as possible. I felt I had no choice but to run away. I went to Mwanza city and after living on the streets for two days I got a job. The job was back-breaking. I cared for two children, cleaned the house, washed clothes, fetched water, went to the market for shopping and cooked. I would wake up for work at 5.30 and work until I went to bed at 11. I didn’t get time to rest and felt completely isolated. The worst thing was the feeling of being treated like a second class human being. I wasn’t even allowed to eat with the family, instead I was asked to wait until they ate and I would get their leftovers. My salary? 20,000 Tanzanian shillings per month, around £6 ($10). I felt trapped. It took me a long time to get the courage to find another employer. Luckily, I managed to find one, and for some time it all went well. My new employer even allowed me to attend classes and training run by a local group called Kivulini Women’s Rights Organization – partners of Anti-Slavery International (who nominated me for the award) in a project that reached out to child domestic workers to build up their skills, confidence and knowledge of their rights. It changed my life completely. I soon became very active in the project and even travelled with Anti-Slavery and another organisation Children Unite to Geneva to take part in lobbying for the adoption by the ILO of a new Domestic Work Convention recognising the rights of domestic workers worldwide. It was a great experience, a lot of hard work, meeting after meeting talking about the issues child domestic workers commonly face and protections they need. A bit scary, I never thought I would ever speak to so many important people. But it was worth it: the ILO adopted the Convention! Even better, an important part of the Convention is strong protections for children. Ironically, soon after I came back from Geneva things at work took a bad turn and my employer started to sexually harass me. By then I knew my rights and was confident enough to stand up to him but it didn’t take long until he threw me out of his house and told everyone in the community not to employ me. Fortunately, Kivulini helped me again and I was able to set up my own small business, a mobile stationery shop. I also came together with five of my fellow child domestic workers to think about what we could do ourselves to claim our rights and we decided to set up our own organisation called WoteSawa – All Equal in English – supporting child domestic workers in my city. We now have over 400 members. The truth is, domestic workers, and especially children, are one of the most vulnerable groups of workers in the world to abuse and exploitation. There are estimated to be over 52 million people working as domestic workers across the world, including over 17 million children of whom the overwhelming majority are women and girls. The child domestic workers we work with, some as young as eight years-old, encounter all kinds of problems. They often suffer verbal and physical abuse. For us girls, sexual violence is a big and very common problem. Emotional violence is also endemic, hearing our employers tell us ‘you are nothing’ is as commonplace as it gets. Many children are paid nothing or very little and are not able to attend school, so they have very little chance of progressing into well paid jobs, and this vicious cycle of abuse continues. Domestic work was always seen as informal ‘help’ rather than proper employment, so it has been exempt from regular employment laws. Any suggestions that private households should also be treated as a formal workplace would draw angry attacks from those who wanted what happens behind closed doors to remain private. This is why the Domestic Work Convention is so important. Finally, domestic workers are recognised as workers, given fundamental labour rights and protected from abuse by the law – things that any other worker would take for granted. But here is a sad fact. Today is the fourth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention, yet so far only 18 countries have ratified it and adjusted their domestic legislation. Some countries are slowly going through the legislative process and hopefully they’ll catch up soon. Sadly, my country isn’t one of them. And nor is the UK, which not only refuses to ratify the Convention, but it was one of only eight countries that did not vote in favour of it, alongside countries such as Sudan or El Salvador. Shameful. I was lucky - at critical time I received support that gave me strength and the confidence to move on and advocate for my fellow workers. But I can see exploitation and abuse of children on a daily basis and I can see how it affects them. They need protection. I hope you can join me today in calling governments all around the world to ratify the Convention and implement it to stop these abuses. Domestic workers need the Convention. We have keep pressure on governments and employers so that the protections and rights the Convention gives us become a reality.","In Tanzania, internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims’ family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in domestic servitude throughout the country and in sex trafficking particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with Kenya.
Angel ran away from home to avoid a forced marriage and accepted exploitative domestic work to avoid being homeless. Her story demonstrates how initiatives by anti-slavery NGOs to educate young workers about their rights can help them to avoid financial and sexual exploitation."
Annabel,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Domestic slavery,Philippines (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,Philippines (slavery location),"I am Annabel and was born in 1991 in Bohol. I was happy as a child until my father raped me. I was six. It was my mother’s birthday and he raped me in our own house. Despite what he did to me, I still showed respect to him and did not tell anyone about it because I wanted my family to be intact. I did not want a broken family. I graduated elementary school when I was 13 and it was sad because my mother and two sisters were late so I requested my grade four teacher to escort me up to the stage. After graduation I worked as babysitter for one of our neighbours but left after some months because my male employer made sexual advances towards me. I went home but my father always nagged at me for not helping to put food on the table so I went working as a sales lady in one of the local convenience stores in our community. I found the work too strenuous for me because I had to lift very heavy things so I quit but again suffered from the naggings of my father. I then decided to come to Cebu City as a nanny. I was there for nine months. At first my employer was kind but later she did not pay me so I left. I started to look for another job. I applied for a job as a guest relations officer (GRO) in one of the local bars in the city. I was 14 years old at that time. My role was to entertain men customers but I did not experience being ‘bar fined’ [where money is paid to a bar to take a girl for sex – the more money paid, the more time the customer buys]. It was December 30 when I started this kind of work and the bar was raided on January 17, 2006. I was so ashamed because I was on national television and my townsfolk saw me. Luckily, my parents did not have television in our house, so they did not see me on TV. The rescue operation was very traumatic for me. I felt betrayed because I found out later that the customer whom I thought was very caring towards me while I was in the bar was actually a National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agent. During the rescue he did not even bother to talk to me. I thought he was only using me so that the raid could be executed. I was very sad. After I was rescued I was placed in a government facility. I did not like the facility because the food was not good and the social workers were not accommodating. However, as time went by I adapted to the environment and I studied my first year at secondary level. However, my father took me out of the centre and brought me home. My neighbours were very judgemental and made me the topic of their gossip. During my stay at our place I met a married man and had an affair with him for more than a year. In January 2008 I was taken out of my community by an NGO social worker who referred me to the Good Shepherd Recovery Centre. Trafficking to me means using women and girls for money, exploiting the bodies of women and children. When I was working in the bar as a GRO I just allowed my customers to do whatever they wanted to do with me. I would go to the comfort room and cry after entertaining the customers. I asked myself, “Why am I into this situation? I don’t like this happening in my life.” I was a “stay- in” in the casa [brothel] where I worked so my time was very regulated by the house caretaker. Anywhere I went and what time I came home had to be traced/followed or else I would pay a penalty for going against the rules. When I was in the trafficking situation, I thought I was stripped of my dignity but now I realise that my dignity is still here with me. I have to do things to raise my dignity and have to fight for my rights. My consciousness of my right over my body is important. My faith in God keeps me going. I made God the centre of my life. Without Him I don’t know where I am now. God gave me the gift of forgiveness and understanding which is manifested in my openness. I am not afraid of telling my story to people whom I trust and this lessens the pain. I have forgiven my father. I think I was born a dreamer, I have plenty of dreams and these give me hope and strength to go on. I am proud of myself because despite the many problems that I have been through, I am still standing with dreams and hopes. I am a survivor; I survived every trial in my life. I am also proud that I have empathy for other trafficked victims and share my own life story so other girls can learn from it. By sharing, I feel I have contributed to their well-being. Much more, I am proud that I graduated secondary level and now am in tertiary education, taking a course in social work. I chose this course because I feel that my experience can serve as a learning for other people so that they will be prevented from experiencing what I had. I want my experience not to be only an experience, I would like to use it as a testimony so that other people will be helped. I am in the best position to share my experience to others and I want it to be a positive factor for others and to inspire their lives. If I was given 5 million pesos for human trafficking services, first I would use it to set up community advocacy to inform other people, especially in rural areas, and prevent them from being victimised by human traffickers. Second, I would establish a centre like the Recovery Centre to help more women and girls. If I become a social worker, I will be kind-hearted and understanding. I will help other people with open arms, with no discrimination. Because of my experience, I have become a stronger person.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism. Rising internet usage rates, the availability of mobile phones and poverty has fostered online child sexual exploitation. 
Annabel left school at 13 and began working various exploitative jobs, first in domestic service and then in a brothel, where she experienced a police raid. Instead of coming to her rescue, the effect of the police operation was to shame and stigmatize Annabel in her own community, making it harder for her to reintegrate or find other work. Annabel also discusses her future, and what changes she would like to see to prevent vulnerable people becoming enslaved."
Arwa,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Syria (slavery location) Iraq (trafficked from),Iraq (slavery location),"They took us first to Syria, to a place near Hassake. There we were kept in a house with lots of girls. After 10 days a group of us were taken back to Iraq, to Mosul, for two days. Then I was taken to Baiji with one of my sisters and some of my cousins, while four of my sisters and two of my cousins were taken to Syria. In Baiji I was kept in two different places and after about three weeks I was taken to Rambussi, near Sinjar, with my 13-year-old cousin, while my sister was taken to my mother who is being held in another village with other relatives. In Rambussi we were held in a house with five other girls. There they did to me what they did to many other girls. I was raped. My cousin was not molested; they wanted to take her to marry her to a man but in the end they left her with us and then we managed to escape. One of the girls said she was not raped but I don’t know if it is true; I hope it is true. Another did not talk about what happened to her. The others were raped. The men were all Iraqis. They said that if we killed ourselves they would kill our relatives. Narrative provided by Amnesty International in the report 'Escape from Hell: Torture and Sexual Slavery in Islamic State Captivity in Iraq'","ISIS has singled out the Yezidi minority, notably its women and children, for particularly brutal treatment. In August 2014, ISIS fighters abducted hundreds, possibly thousands, of Yezidi men, women and children who were fleeing the IS takeover from the Sinjar region, in the north-west of the country. Hundreds of the men were killed and others were forced to convert to Islam under threat of death. Younger women and girls, some as young as 12, were separated from their parents and older relatives and sold, given as gifts or forced to marry ISIS fighters and supporters. Arwa was abducted in August 2014 in a village south of Mount Sinjar with scores of her relatives and hundreds of neighbours. She was held in ISIS captivity in various places in Syria and Iraq, where she was raped, before escaping. Sixty-two of her relatives, including her mother and siblings, are still in ISIS hands. She was 15 years old during her enslavement and when she told her story in late 2014."
Ayesha,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bangladesh (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I approach the petrol pump and see a tall, confident young woman directing traffic. “Come again,” she says to a customer as he drives away. Dignified and independent, she lives the life I dreamt for her. Our eyes meet and this business woman becomes my child. I extend my arms to pull her in close. “I am so proud of you,” I whisper, as I remember all the times I resisted the pimps who tried to prostitute her. I was born in a small village in Jessore, Bangladesh. My father was a simple farmer. We were poor, but all of my eight brothers and sisters went to school. I was known in my village as the girl with the golden voice. Growing up, my songs were about the earth, the sky, and my village. But when I met the man I wanted to marry, my songs changed to my love for him. He was twice my age. We would sit together for hours as he told me tales of his far-away travels to big cities. I was impressed by everything about him—his bicycle, his radio, his clothes. When I turned 13, he told me he wanted to marry me, and that he could make me into a famous singer one day. I agreed. It is very common for girls to marry early in rural India and Bangladesh. Since women are valued mostly as homemakers and mothers, families have no incentive to keep their daughters in school. The older a girl gets, the more her family will have to pay for her dowry. For these reasons, many of my friends were already married when the question was posed to me. My heart beat fast as we crossed the border in the darkness of night. I had never been to a big city like Kolkata, and so I was distracted from the reality that I was leaving my family and my school. I was terrified of being caught, but thrilled at the prospect of settling down with the man I loved. When we arrived, he told me he wanted to keep me safe with his aunt until my parents stopped looking for us. In a few days, he would return for me. I was reluctant to see him go, but I trusted his decision. That night, in the glow of moonlight, I saw girls in short skirts and red lipstick standing in a line on the street. When a man approached one of them, she led him into her house. The next morning, I asked his aunt about these girls. She spoke to me in a hollow voice devoid of emotion. I was told that I had been sold to her by the man I loved, and that I would have to work off my debt by joining those girls each night. I still remember that moment when my whole world shattered into pieces. I’ve been tortured and abused, and survived serious injuries inflicted by buyers and pimps, but nothing hurts as much as the pain of being deceived by the man I loved. For a whole month, I resisted the ‘aunt,’ who I learned was really a brothel madam. The owner of the brothel grew impatient and raped me, as he did to all new girls. He ordered the brothel madam to beat me with a leather belt every day. I still bear these marks on my body. I was kept locked inside a room, with no food or water, for days. To “break me in,” I was raped several times a night for nearly a month before the madam started selling me to men for money. It was typical for me to have ten to twelve buyers every night. They were usually abusive, treating me as if they owned my body. I have a deep scar on my neck from a knife blade, which I got trying to save a young girl in my house from being gang raped. It almost killed me. Later I would learn that my story was not unique. There were hundreds of us—young girls from Bangladesh, Nepal and other parts of India, sold into brothels. To keep us isolated the brothel owners forbid us to speak to girls in other houses. They were very afraid that we would form groups or befriend one another. I tried to leave that dungeon many times. Memories still flash in my mind of my hair being pulled, of being dragged through the dirt streets by the brothel owner after a failed escape. Even though I cried, screamed for someone to help me, people just stood by watching, without even a look of sympathy. Tears stream down my face as I think back to that day. If even one man had tried to save me, my life would have been changed. But all of them stood there like mute spectators. When people tell me that women choose this life, I can’t help but laugh. Do they know how many women like me have tried to escape, but have been beaten black and blue when they are caught? To the men who buy us, we are like meat. To everybody else in society, we simply do not exist. I had three children in my captivity—two beautiful daughters and a son. My children were my treasure, yet my love for them was often accompanied by fear of what would become of them in the red light area. As my children grew, it became hard for me to provide for them. My daughters had to drop out of school for financial reasons, while my son, who suffers from autism, needed my constant attention. The local pimps began to hint that I could make some money if I prostituted my two daughters. However, the pimps never touched them. All of the women in the brothel banded together to keep our children out of prostitution. One day, I heard about an organization called Apne Aap, which helped women in my area leave prostitution. In 2010, I joined a self-empowerment group, where I quickly found a community of nine other women with similar stories. As I conversed with women who had made new lives for themselves, I felt hopeful for the first time that I could leave prostitution. It took me some time, but I permanently exited prostitution last year. I asked Apne Aap staff to help my daughters find dignified livelihoods, so they wouldn’t be prostituted. Apne Aap worked hard to find my eldest daughter a job. They set up interviews for her, offered her professional training and helped her eventually connect with a woman entrepreneur who owned the first all-women run petrol pump in Kolkata. Today, my daughter’s salary as a station supervisor provides for all of us. Although I am happy to no longer be in prostitution, with so many years taken from me, I have little options for an alternative way to support my family. I know this will not be my daughter’s fate. She is making a life for herself outside of the red light area. Because of her, I sing again.","Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India. Ayesha was sold into sexual slavery by a man she fell in love with as a child, and had three children. Although pressured into prostituting her two daughters, she and the other women in her brothel resisted, and Ayesha left sex slavery with the help of an organization named Apne Aap, which also managed to find work for her eldest daughter. Ayesha’s story makes clear the vital role that organisations can play in bringing people sustainably out of slavery."
Belen,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"I am Belen. I grew up in the northern part of Cebu with my father and mother, together with my other siblings, two boys and two girls. I was the third-born child. My father was a construction worker. I cannot remember well about my mother’s work; however, I remember that she gambled and most of the time she was out of the house. I think she used to bake also. I observed that my parents always quarrelled but I did not know the reasons for their quarrels. When I was young I used to help my aunty in her sari-sari store [a small convenience outlet] as well as cleaning our house and looking after my little brothers and sister. At age eight, my mother took me to another island far from our home. This was after a big fight with my father. All I remember from that time is that my mother sold me to a bar owner in that place. At the age of nine, I was rescued from that bar by some government workers. I stayed at the government centre for young girls for a year. After the incident when I was eight, I never saw my parents again. I only saw my older sister, who was also prostituted. She was tough and has left prostitution.  At 10, I was transferred to a non-government organisation located in Cebu City. While at the centre I finished grade three and went on to take a government examination. I was accelerated to grade six but I did not enrol for a higher level because I ran away from the centre. I was 14 at that time. I was staying in one of the main streets in the city when someone recruited me to go to the red light district. Until now I am still very angry at my mother for what she did to me. I remember I told her when she left me at the bar that it would have been better for me if she had killed me when I was young. I did not have a good childhood experience; I just grew up without knowing it. If I could rewrite my story, I just wish that my mother would say sorry for what she did to me when I was young and then I would also ask her to forgive me.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Bella,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"My name is Bella and I'm 21 years old. I was born in Phnom Penh, and when I was young one lady she tricked me. She said that ""go there"" to her house, I just go to clean her house, or prepare her clothes, something like that, and then after she fit me like one or two months, she sell me. When I was twelve years old I have been work - like trafficking - they forced me to go to have sex with guys, and I always don't want to go. And she always hits me, and blame me. I work there about one month and I really hurt, like I want to go away from the place, but I cannot go. She sends me there, to the house, and then have the guy come in, like, a day maybe five. They pay like $20 and then he do something bad to me. I say no and cry, and I said, ""please let me go."" She told me that if I escape from her place she will do something to my family. I feel like I hopeless, I have nothing, no one care about me, and no one thinks I'm special. And my future, I will think - I will die one day and if I still work like that I will get disease and I will die. Nothing. And then, have two foreigners, they called me and two friends and go to the hotel. And they said they want to have sex, like that. Then, at that time I feel like happy, I don't know why, but I feel different. Then we went to the hotel, and then we sit, and we're waiting. And then, have two foreigner guys, and they come and talk with us and ask us about our life. And then we told them and then they ask me and my friend ""do you want to leave the place that you stay?"" We said, ""Yes, we want"" and then, after that, the police come, and they save us. Then I went to Agape. So I come to live there about four years and they give me a lot of opportunities. They love me a lot and they show me they all come to partake in my life. They let me go to school, education, do what I want to do in the future. They always give me advice and they always encourage me that I am special. especially Don, he always said that I'm special, but before I could not get it, because I think that I'm not special, but he always say it and now I know I'm special. I think God will use me to help other girls that have been trafficked and I know that hurt and I know they don't want. So I know God will use me to save them and to tell them that God can help them and loves them. And tell them that they are special. And if they become in Jesus they will be saved and will have more love.      ","Cambodia was renowned as a sex tourism destination in the 1990s and this legacy is still prevalent today with women and girls trafficked within the thriving sex industry in Cambodia's major cities. Despite significant attempts to curb CSE, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels. Boys and young men are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation, with many entering the massage industry due to a lack of training and skills. Bella was sold into sex slavery by a woman she met who recruited her for domestic work. Her story demonstrates the ways in which survivors can be supported by organisations to gain self-confidence and education, in order to avoid returning to situations of slavery."
Beth,2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I’d like you to imagine that a young woman is kidnapped as she’s walking home from work. Her kidnapper threatens her life and forces her to rob a convenience store. Should she be charged and held legally accountable for that? Put it this way. It is clear how absurd it is to criminalize the victim and yet, real men and women trafficked in the sex trade are regularly tried and convicted in America’s courtrooms. I know this is true because I am one of those trafficking victims. For more than 20 years, I’ve been living in absurd reality in which I am a criminal in the eyes of the law. Each state has the right to decide how long they’re going to hold your criminal background against you and the state that I live in is Arizona. I’m required to tell prospective employers about my criminal background that I was trafficked, I have prostitution charges from that and I have to tell them for 99 years. So when I’m 117 years old and I apply for a job, then I don’t have to tell them that I was a trafficking victim. So, we need to change that. I got hired by the state of Arizona as a child protection sex crimes investigator because I have a lot of experience in sex crimes. They finger-printed me. They wanted a clearance card and one month later, they let me go because I had nine charges that came up from 1980 to 1983. This was in 2012. Even though, I got out, went through my healing process, I went to college, got a BSW, I worked with women just like me for another 15 years in the state of Minnesota, I moved to Arizona, and all of a sudden, I’m a criminal again. Not good. Very traumatizing actually. I feel like I’ve rehabilitated myself already and it just doesn’t seem like justice is being served. Despite being arrested a hundreds of times for prostitution-related crimes before I was 21, nobody ever tried to intervene in any proactive, positive way at all. To make matters worse, even though I was a child, I got finger-printed as an adult because that’s part of the growing process. They take everything from you. They take your belongings, your clothes, your jewelry, your ID, and they also take your name and your age. They told me my name was Julie and then I was 21 when I was 16. So when I was 17, I was 22. Somehow, in the end of all these, the charges from I was really 16, it looked like I was 21. Some of them stuck on my name and it’s a huge process to get that off. I got my degree in social work, launched a career helping women get out of the sex agency. I’ve started an agency in Arizona called Willow Way. It’s survivor-run, survivor-driven. I think it’s important that we address this issue because many other women like me will be denied jobs just like I have because of their criminal backgrounds and I think a lot of people don’t think about that issue when they think about women getting out and healing. Today, Arizona is on the cusp of writing this wrong. Last year, a governor-appointed taskforce published a report recommending Arizona improve on how it addresses trafficking which is wonderful. It is my hope that Governor Brewer will make it a priority to push legislation that addresses the needs identified by the taskforce to ensure that trafficking victims are not treated as criminal and that the victim receive more access to needed services. They do have that laid out very nicely in the plan they made. I hope that you will join me to do whatever we can to make sure the law is enforced, and to make that law enforcement, service providers, all of us recognize trafficking survivors as victims of a crime who deserve support and specialized services and not condemnation and blame. Please stop the life sentences."," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking exists throughout the country. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Beth Jacobs ran away from home at the age of 16. Beth recalls how she was ‘befriended’ by a trafficker, drugged, raped, and taken to another state. She was forced to provide sexual services for six years, subjected to daily abuse including rape and beatings. Beth calls on the Arizona legislature to enact provisions supported by the state’s Human Trafficking Task Force to end the criminalization of human trafficking victims.  "
Bilal,2013 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"My name is Bilal ould Salka, I was born a slave in Ehel Legreyve, like my mother, my brothers and my sister and I have been given to Mahjouba mint Legreyve. Since my childhood, I did all the housework, laundry, dishes, cooking and other chores and when I finished preparing meals, my masters ate together, but the Mahjouba sent me away and I ate alone as an unclean. Mahjouba mint Legreyve my mistress, who is the wife of Mohamed Yahya Ould Brahim Taleb, the shopkeeper in the Chogar market, and all tribal member Oulad Ahmed. When she moved to the town of Aleg to teach his daughters (Maimouna, Fatimetou, Mouna) and boys (Sheikh Hamoud, and Sidi Khaled) at the schools in the city of Aleg, I accompanied her to her home in Aleg to be the domestic slave, although among the children of my mistress Mahjouba mint Legreyve Hamoud alone is older than me. But all were to enter the school, except for me. I followed the sheep day and night and I went back to take care of small children and do the housework until morning. My big brother Saleck began to tell me to look to rebel and escape these conditions of slavery, and when the eldest son of my mistress Mahjouba, Hamoud Ould Mohamed Yahya Ould Brahim Taleb, noted the attempts of my brother, he warned me against this dangerous adventure that is the act of leaving and joining the Moorish slaves and that slaves can not be a good example. But after a period of reflections around the ideas that my brother Saleck gave me, the usefulness of leaving the Moors, I decided to go. I took a bag containing my clothes. Mahjouba mint Legreyve, my mistress, took off my bag, saying: “It was I who bought these clothes and since you are leaving me, you're going without clothes, you do not deserve anything.” This is how I left at night. I recall that during my captivity in this family, I experienced corporal punishment from the hand of Mahjouba and her husband Mohamed Yahya Ould Brahim Taleb. I filed a complaint with the state against the family; my mother, my sister and my brothers, and I request the assistance of Biram and his organization for me and my family to set us free and let us be a free family, united and independent.","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives. People in slavery come from the Haratine ethnic group, historically enslaved by White Moors. They can be bought and sold, or given as gifts, and face a lifetime of exploitation and abuse. Rape of female slaves is common and their children also become slaves. They are Muslims, and many believe that it is Allah’s wish for them to be enslaved because they are told that their paradise is bound to their Master. In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem. Bilal’s story shows how people can be encouraged or inspired to risk escaping from slavery after observing someone else leaving their situation, in this case her brother."
Cathy,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Philippines (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Philippines (slavery location),"I am Cathy. I am 20 years of age and was born in the north of the Philippines. I lived with my paternal grandmother as a young child and was told that my mother had been a prostitute and had met my father in a bar. She became pregnant with twin girls and we were adopted out to separate places. Luckily for me I was adopted in the local area so I was able to be reunited with my grandmother and father. I heard years later that my twin sister had died. I met my mother only once before she died. I was 10 at that time and she was selling vegetables in the market and a neighbour pointed her out to me. My father was worried that my mother would make my life a mess if we stayed together and so I stayed living with my lola [grandmother]. When I was 13 I attended my mother’s funeral. I was told that she was pregnant at the time and had been beaten up by her live-in partner. She had many bruises all over her body. It was very scary to see her that way. I was not really distressed at the actual time of her death because I did not really know her. However, I regretted that I did not have much time to be with her. Although I was loved by my grandmother, it’s not the same as the love of a mother that I really wanted. If I could turn back time, I would love to have my mother, even for one month, so that I could feel her love. I attended school up until my second year of high school. My grandmother was the one who bore the cost of my schooling, though sometimes my father would give her money. My aunties really resented me because of the care my grandmother gave me. They were cruel to me and teased me and told me I was going to end up a prostitute like my mother. This made me sad, but I loved school and I was especially proud when I won Miss Filipina in my school. My aunties didn’t believe that I could do it, but I joined the parade and I won because of a poem I wrote. I couldn’t imagine that I would ever win. It was a very happy moment for me. When I was a teenager, I left school because I had told my grandma that I would help earn money. I started work as a waitress. It was during this time that I had an affair with a married man. His wife was out to get me so I needed to leave that place. An acquaintance of mine asked me if I wanted to work in Cebu. I told him that it was so far away and that I was only 16, but he arranged for two other friends of mine who were also minors to come to Cebu with me. He told us we would earn good money as waitresses but when we arrived in Cebu we were transported in a van to a club. When we entered the club it was big and dark but I knew it was a club because there were lights flickering and plenty of girls with heavy make-up. I was nervous at that moment because I knew that this is what they wanted me to do also. I didn’t feel good about it. I had to wear heavy make- up and put on shorts which were very transparent, my underwear could be seen, and I also had to wear boots. We were given numbers to wear so that we could be identified by the customers. We were called one after the other to dance on the stage. My heart was pumping very fast and I was perspiring and I really didn’t know what was happening. For three weeks I was just dancing on the stage and then one night I was told that somebody had ‘bar fined’ me. I did not know what this meant. A more experienced woman explained that a man had bought me. She loaned me her cell phone and told me to call her when I got to the hotel. When I got there I rang her and she told me to take a bath and then to lie down on the bed and so I followed her instructions. Later she text me and told me if I was done I should take a bath and return to the club. I was so ashamed but I could not escape my situation. I had more customers after that. Some gave me big tips and some guys were nice to me. I was cautious though because some of the more experienced women told me that foreigners were more inclined to beat their customers. I was always on guard. My customers were generally Korean, Japanese and American. I never went with a Filipino because I was too ashamed. I gave all my earnings to the two women who were my managers; this included any tips that were given to me. They said that I had plenty of debts. My debts included payment for living in the apartment, my food, clothing and make up. I could not escape because there were people who watched what we were doing – we called them ‘watchers’. I think I was in that bar for two years. A few days before I turned 18 the bar was raided. Our casa, our apartment, was raided early in the morning. We were so shocked because we slept in our bras and undies and when we opened our eyes there were lights from the cameras shining in our eyes. We were told to get dressed. They raided three casas simultaneously. All the casas were operated by the same managers. There were 90 of us but not all were minors. During the raid I was shocked and afraid. I even hid behind the door because there were plenty of cameras and we were soon on television and in the news. Although I had had problems earlier in life I did not know that another problem awaited me in Cebu. I pitied myself for what happened to me. I felt that I was alone and nobody would support me, that I would just have this lonely life. I interacted with my co-workers but my own true feelings, I did not share. I did not trust anyone. I did not know, if I told them my real feelings, whether they would not tell my managers, and that could have caused conflict. And I was angry with myself. I wondered how I could let all this happen to me. There were times when I was a victim of trafficking that I just went with the flow, like I just accepted it. But I still had hopes and I fought for my future. No one can treat me like a dog. I had a limit to what could be done.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Charlotte,2010 (Narrative date),War slavery Sexual exploitation,Uganda (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Uganda (slavery location),"My name is Charlotte Awino and I am from Uganda. In 1996 I was fourteen years old and attended a boarding school in northern Uganda: St Mary’s Senior Secondary School, Aboke. The rebels of the Lord’s Resistance Army, (LRA), attacked our school at night and abducted us, 139 girls. They tied us up with ropes. 109 of the girls were later released to the deputy head mistress of the school and 30 girls were kept, including me. We were marched off for three months across the Ugandan border into southern Sudan. So many atrocities were committed against us, the children who were abducted. Even our basic right to life was taken away. So many of the children were killed because they were too tired to walk long distances. Others starved to death. Many died due to cholera, but also we were used as human shields during fighting. So many of us we were killed at the battle. The rebels put us in front when they were fighting the Ugandan government soldiers. As usual, we girls suffered more. We were distributed to rebel commanders as objects without rights and were sexually abused. We had to carry very heavy loads, cook and other duties including digging in the gardens in the rebel camps. I was given to a man who had 20 other abducted girls and he was a brutal man and I had two children with him. One day the rebel leader Joseph Kony ordered the soldiers to beat me two hundred strokes for an allegation that I was trying to escape. I wasn’t conscious, yet the beating continued, and I was left for dead. I woke up after 10 hours of unconsciousness. I felt very thirsty, but I was denied water until very late in the evening, somebody gave me little water to drink. After that I was confined in a small hut under armed guards for several months. The guards were under orders to shoot me if I moved 5 meters from that hut. I was in captivity for seven years and ten months and I escaped in the year 2004, when the rebels had come back to northern Uganda. I could take months talking about what I went through, and what I saw. But I must be brief, so I will tell you what I think must be done to help others like me. Affected people should be given support to recover psychologically, they should be given counselling, accepting them back into the community. They should have physical support, health provision of basics, like shelter, and others. They should be given educational support. There should be protection, where each member state should protect its citizens, and especially the vulnerable women and children during wars and conflicts. A mechanism must be put in place to track and trace missing people and the means must be put in place to identify the trafficked persons. The UN protection law should be translated in local languages globally. Whoever wants to fight against the government or opposition groups must be made aware that they have responsibilities not to kill or abduct the local people. Signatories to the UN statutes should practically commit themselves to the laws they commit themselves to. Uganda is a signatory country but it did not protect people like me during war. I left so many children behind me still in captivity. Some of them are already young adults. What can the UN do for them? Other trafficked children are going to become prostitutes, rebels or terrorists, like I was?","Charlotte’s story explains how at the age of 14 years she was abducted from a boarding school and held captive for 8 years by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Her mother Angelina Atyam never stopped speaking out and working for her release and that of thousands abducted children in Uganda – despite threats by the LRA. According to the United States Department of State Trafficking in Persons report 2017, some Ugandans abducted by the LRA prior to 2006 remain unaccounted for, and may remain captive with LRA elements in the DRC, Central African Republic, and the disputed area of Kafia Kingi, which is claimed by both Sudan and South Sudan."
Chi,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Southeast Asia (trafficked from),Europe (slavery location),"They took me to the house where the cannabis was growing. The trafficker warned me that if I left the building, he would not be responsible for my safety and he could not guarantee that the posted security guards would not kill me. The door to the premises was locked and I did not have a key. The windows were covered. There were other people already in the building. None of them had a key to the door. There were no beds, mattresses or blankets. I had to sleep in a room with one other person. The space was very cold but the areas where the cannabis was growing were very hot. The only food we had to eat was rice and sauce. There was a toilet, but no shower. We had to boil water in order to wash. There was soap and shampoo but no towels. I dried myself with my own clothes. I felt scared about being locked in the building. I felt imprisoned. I did not expect to find myself locked inside a cannabis factory. I thought I would be working in a shop or in some other normal job.","The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day in 2016, an estimated 3.6 million men, women and chidlren were living in modern slavery in Europe and Central Asia. People are subjected to exploitation in forced labour, debt bondage and forced sexual exploitation. Government response in Europe is particularly strong with a number of regional bodies holding them account and monitoring responses, and while countries in Central Asia have taken steps to tack modern slavery, more needs to be done. “Chi” was trafficked from Southeast Asia for the purpose of growing cannabis, though he expected that he would be undertaking legal work in his destination country. His story demonstrates how enslavement can intersect with other illegal industries."
Christina A.,2012 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Forced labour,Spain (slavery location) Romania (trafficked from) Forced labour,Belgium (slavery location),"My name is Cristina. I’m 15 and I come from Romania. I lived there and then went to England. I stayed with my little sisters and brother. I minded them, always at home with them. And then, one day, my mother married me off. A friend of hers came to our house and said he wanted to marry me. I heard this and cried, and did all kinds of things not to marry him. She said, “It’s my decision. You must live by it.” My husband was 18. I was only 13 and couldn’t do anything. He was mean. He didn’t know how to act with a girl 14 or 15. He acted as if I were a woman of 20 or 30. Then I went to Romania where they made my passport and stuff. After that I went to Spain. I stole and he stayed home. I never wanted to steal but I had to or he would hit me. He saw that stealing wasn’t working in Spain, so we came to Belgium. I thought that what was doing was wrong and I wanted to stop, and so the police arrested me. I got myself arrested voluntarily. If I hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t be here. They put me in a center and I started to live a normal life. When I think about it all, I feel really sad. It’s not…","Romania is a significant source of sex and labor trafficking victims throughout Europe. Romanian men, women, and children are subjected to labor trafficking in agriculture, construction, domestic service, hotels, and manufacturing, as well as forced begging and theft in Romania and other European countries. Romani children are particularly vulnerable to forced begging and sex trafficking. Corruption is a prevalent issue: government officials have been convicted of human trafficking crimes, and there have been reports of local officials obstructing trafficking investigations. Married against her will at 13 and forced to steal by her husband in Spain and Belgium, Christina now lives in a youth shelter and is going to school."
Concy,2013 (Narrative date),War slavery Sexual exploitation,Uganda (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Uganda (slavery location),"As a young child, my life was good and I felt happy. I spent many evenings playing netball and dancing with my friends. My family’s home was located in Unyama, a village outside of Gulu, in northern Uganda. I am the youngest of four children, two boys and two girls. As a child, I helped fetch water and cook for my family, but I also attended primary school. My father was never home, so my mother and grandfather raised me. We were a happy family that loved each other. When I was nine years old, my life changed suddenly. On the night of May 22, 2000, rebels with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) descended on our home. My mother and I were asleep in our hut when they barged in and woke us up by kicking down the door. Five men caught us right away. One man held me down, ripped off my blouse, and tied me up. I watched in horror as another man beat my mother badly. One of the rebels brought in a large bag of posho—maize meal—and ordered me to carry it. They tied up my grandfather and others in my village and forced all of us to walk and walk without rest to an unknown destination. After a few days, the rebels allowed my grandfather to leave, but he could not even look into my eyes to say goodbye. He walked away in silence. The rebels told me not to be afraid because they would take me back home, but I didn’t believe them. I feared they were going to kill me. The rebels didn’t kill me, but they forced me to kill others. I was trained to fight and shoot a gun. At first I refused, but they beat me and threatened me with death. The rebels made examples out of some of the children to warn the rest of us what would happen if we disobeyed their orders. The boys were forced to rape, and the girls got raped. All the girls were divided among the male fighters as “wives.” The leaders believed the male fighters would escape if they did not have “wives” to fulfill their sexual desires. When I was 10 years old, I was married against my will to a Brigade Commander. The first time he forced me to have sex; I bled and cried a lot. I was in great pain, but my “husband” had a gun next to him and I had seen him use it before so I tried to stop crying. Every day he called me and demanded sex. Whenever I tried to resist, he beat me to the point of paralysis. Sometimes I felt so weak because we had no food or water, but I had to go to him anyway. The Brigade Commander had a total of 20 “wives”—some were very young, but most were between 12 and 18 years old. If the rebels raided a village and abducted a beautiful girl, she would be forced to marry the Brigade Commander. Since I was also a soldier who fought, I was more respected than some of the other girls who were only “wives.” When my “husband” would go away, I would stay with his other “wives” and keep them in line. I knew that if any of them ever escaped, I would be killed. A year into my captivity, a big fight erupted not far from where we were being held between LRA members and Ugandan government soldiers. I decided to use the opportunity to run away, as I would rather die trying to escape than die in the bush as a sex slave. Two other girls ran with me, and we made it to the barracks where the government soldiers were staying. When we arrived, the guards took our guns and gave us clothes and food. After a while, they took us back to our villages. When I returned home, my mother accepted me despite my past. However, my neighbors and community were afraid of me and shunned me; they knew I was forced to commit unspeakable acts of violence. Life was difficult even at home. I suffered from extreme insomnia, haunted by memories of the rebels. I was still breathing, but somehow I didn’t really feel alive. My mind kept replaying the past. I tried to return to school when I was 12, but I couldn’t concentrate on what my teachers were saying. I found other people who had suffered like me, but I still felt so alone. One day when I was 15, I was walking home from school when a man around 19 years old approached me and forcibly took me into his hut deep in the bush. I tried to fight the man, but he was too strong. No one was around to help me or hear my screams. When I went home, my mom chased me away, telling me to go back to the man since he was my husband now. I didn’t want to go back to him; I wanted to go to school. However, I had nowhere else to go, so I returned to him and soon grew pregnant with my daughter. My family accepted me again since I was living with the man as his wife. I spent a year with my new “husband”, but he drank too much alcohol. We would fight and he would beat me badly for no reason. After one particularly vicious beating, I took my child and fled to my mother’s home. I stayed at home for six months and then I heard about ChildVoice International. Since then my life has changed. I am very different now. I went to ChildVoice not speaking a word of English. During my time there, I learned English and skills such as catering, baking, and tailoring. I also found solace in my growing relationship with God. After leaving ChildVoice, I found work in a bakery in Pece and met my current husband. Unlike my first husband, he is good to me and treats me as an equal. For the first time in my life, I have hope for the future and my children’s future. Today, I believe I can do many good things if I find a way. I am much happier now and can even laugh sometimes. On most days, I can talk about the past without feeling fear and shame. My past no longer stops me from living my future. I want people to know what has happened here in Northern Uganda. Even though the fighting has ceased, men continue to abuse women. Those who have escaped from the bush should be able to return to school and learn some skills so they can have a future. In my country, we do not provide enough support for child soldiers. Right now, there are only a few organizations to help us. Many of us survived the conflict, but we can do nothing but cry about our past since we have no family, food, money or skills. The government needs to provide more support for former child “wives” of the LRA rebels.","In war-torn Uganda, the abduction of boys to become child soldiers has been widely reported on. However, the fate of thousands of Ugandan girls, who were abducted and sexually exploited, forced to become sex slaves for rebels and soldiers during Uganda’s civil war, has received less attention. 
Concy was one of these Ugandan girls who were abducted and forced to serve the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) through sexual slavery, fighting, and forced labour. Her story emphasizes how the stigma around those who manage to escape back to their families and communities makes it difficult to reintegrate, and can lead back into a situation of slavery.
According to the United States Department of State Trafficking in Persons report 2017, some Ugandans abducted by the LRA prior to 2006 remain unaccounted for, and may remain captive with LRA elements in the DRC, Central African Republic, and the disputed area of Kafia Kingi, which is claimed by both Sudan and South Sudan."
Cristy,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Cristy and I am 26 years old. I grew up in the southern part of the Philippines and I was the only girl in a family of seven children. I had a very strong relationship with my father and I was devastated when he died. I was just 12 years old. When he died I really couldn’t accept it. I wished that it had been my mama who had died. My father had always given me whatever I wanted but my mama was not like that. Soon after my father died my mother remarried and I was not happy. The worst thing she did was to allow my younger brother to be adopted by my aunty. They are in a different country now. I still cannot forgive her for this. After completing elementary school I attended high school for only one year. Then I ran away to Cebu. I was 14 years old. At that time I met a German guy who became my boyfriend. I lived with him for a few years until I found out that he had another woman. I was so angry and upset and was always asking myself why he fell in love with another woman. After this I met a woman who had the same name as me. She knew that I needed money and introduced me to Kamagayan [the red light district of Cebu City]. She had a rental property where girls like me also lived. While I was there this woman sold me to a foreigner. She told me I only had to massage him, but I did not know that the foreigner had paid plenty of money to her and that she had promised I would have sex with him. This man was physically abusive to me and forced me to take drugs. I can say that he was a sadist. He enjoyed looking at a woman being in pain before having sex.  After that experience I continued to stay in Kamagayan. I was raped and subjected to many violent acts. I was so drugged up that sometimes I would go without sleep for 24 hours. When I took drugs, I lost my appetite and I couldn’t sleep. When the effect of the drugs wore off I wanted another shot. If I am on drugs, I can entertain men because I am not ashamed. But if I am not on drugs I don’t like customers. I did not receive even five pesos the whole time I was there, because my employer would just give me dresses and drugs and then she would tell me I owed a lot of debts to her. I can now say that I was a victim of trafficking. After four months of living in Kamagayan, the place was raided by police and an NGO here in Cebu. I was happy because I could escape. What kept me going was the thought that I could make money and bring my little brother home. If you are a girl and new to the city you should be careful and you should not go to disco bars. You should choose your friends because there are plenty who are snatchers and who are sweet talkers who will take you to a place that is not good. I think if I had not run away from home I would have finished my schooling and then finished a degree and worked. However, on the other hand, because I ran away from place to place, I found out that I can be alone and independent.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Dai,1995 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Hi my name is Dai, I’m a survivor of human trafficking and exploitation. I have experienced the harm that these forms of violence inflict on those of us who have been sexually exploited. Let me tell you a little history about my life. I have been an American for nearly 21 years. Abused as a child, I made a promise to myself that I would never be abused again. As I continue with my speech, I’m here to share my story specifically regarding my traumatic experience in the sex trafficking. One question that has always perplexed me is the need to share my experiences, and what I witnessed in Las Vegas without exploiting myself. An integral part of my story is that I, and many other minority women, whether American or not, were shipped from state to state in order to provide specific services for men. It has been stated by many that the sex industry has been divided into two distinct classifications: prostitution and trafficking. I encourage you to listen to my story as I reveal to you why I believe they are one and the same. In 1995, I fell in love with a military man, who persuaded me to move with him to an undisclosed remote area. There, I was raped and beat continually while handcuffed to a door of an abandoned house. Eventually, through circumstances, I made my escape, but not before he had confiscated my naturalization papers, driver’s license and social security card. With no proof of my identity, I could not acquire adequate shelter. I felt like an animal that has been cast into the street. My life became a scenario of sojourning from one homeless shelter to another. One day, I was approached by a middle-aged woman who had been watching my every move. Unaware that she was a (Female Pimp), she insisted that I come and work for her in the Escort Service (she assured me that it was only a dating service). My unawareness of this proposition was so overwhelmed by my need for food, money and clothing that I desperately accepted her offer. After several weeks I found myself well provided for and economically stable. Then the unthinkable happened: a client bargained me for sex. After I refused his offer, he grabbed me by the hair, forced me on the floor and raped and beat me. In terror, I fled to the police to report the violence. To my astonishment, the police informed me that I had no rights because I had attained the status of a “street-walker”. Eventually, the female pimp who recruited me sent me to this gentleman who worked in Nevada where my experience in Human Trafficking began. To this day, I am still haunted by flashbacks regarding certain smells, as well as cold floors which numbed my bare feet. Many times, panic ensues when I find myself in a line of women; it resurrects the nightmares of all the humiliating inspection line-ups I had to endure. We were constantly paraded before a potential client; their lustful eyes examining and perusing us before we became final choices for each predatory customer. Being Korean, I remember the time when a prejudiced ‘john’ demanded that I dress as a Japanese prostitute/geisha. My vulnerability was made complete when I was taught to speak broken English, fulfilling the racist image of exoticism. Although, I was one of the few that spoke and understood English, my required masquerade as a foreigner brought more money to the Master through harboring of immigrants. There is no difference between trafficking and prostitution when innocent women and children are being harbored for the sole purpose of the commercial sex trade. Exploiters and pimps are always violating the rights of these victims who are pursuing their freedom to escape from harm. In reality, no female desires to be a part of this nightmare. Most of us were incarcerated in basements, underneath casinos and in abandoned warehouses. Our desperate cries for help were silenced by the walls, which separated us from the rest of the world. While tourists roamed the streets of Las Vegas admiring the architectural beauty and the celestial lights, which permeated the night sky, we, the victims, were in perpetual fear for our lives. The Master, knowing full well that I was an American, forced me to work both the Escort and the Trafficking. If I refused or didn’t comply, I was taken underground and sentenced to various methods of punishment. The vividness of this maltreatment brought back such childhood nightmares of the times I was locked in a closet. Each of these two scenarios mirrored the same cries for freedom; after all, I was the submissive little foreign girl who was threatened not to tell anyone. In both cases, my guilt-ridden confessions of bad behavior resulted in my temporary release. On my knees, I had to convince my Master that I would be on my best behavior. After hours of interrogation, I was given permission to return to do what I did best; being a concubine, and deluding myself into thinking that I enjoyed it. I was involved in trafficking for more than six months. I compare that time to being held hostage in a timeless existence where my mind engaged itself in disassociation with my soul. This mental state was the only way in which I could keep any sanity. Repeatedly, I witnessed the beatings, rapes and murders of innocent women. At times, my tears of hopelessness would drown me into a pathos of my own execution. How could my own country not be aware of these cruelties? How could this kind of discrimination and slavery be given the power to blind immigrant and American women of their rights? The frustration of these and other questions echoed within my catatonic mind. Most of the time we were transported by trucks with drivers who were not naive to our purpose, and well informed of our identity. After months of these transports for trafficking our self-images had been reduced to cattle being loaded on a cattle car. Thousands of dollars were exchanged on these cross-country trips which kept us silent and our existence a secret. There were times that the warehouse truck would stop, the tail gate door forced opened, then two or three were summoned out. We were given shoes and clothing so we would not appear as homeless refugees. We had to walk a block down to a near by truck stop, given fifteen minutes to bathe ourselves, then return to the truck. In degrading humiliation we had to beg for toiletries and other personal items. Sometimes, a policeman would appear on the scene and I would be so tempted to cry out for help, but fear of jeopardizing my life and the lives of the other women prevented me. The quick shower and change of clothing signaled our soon “rendezvous” with the ‘johns’ who requested for us. The women were released a few at a time so as not to raise any suspicion. Selections of adult-aged women and minor girls (who were under the age of sixteen) usually numbered between twenty and fifty. The adult women were expected to resemble a late teen. If they would not comply they were discarded, cast-out, and some were never heard from again. We were constantly monitored, forbidden to make eye contact with anyone in public areas. When we arrived at our destination, the women were separated into motel rooms. We traversed the very rural area of Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, Florida, and New York. We were never paid directly, however, later on I discovered that it would turn more money if clients were deceived into thinking that all of us were immigrants. After months of ongoing physical and mental agony I became apathetic regarding my life; I did not care if I lived or died. With convincing death threats from my Master, I remained silent. If he suspected that I was going to expose him he would verbalize threats against my family and friends. It was at this time that I soul searched an alternative way to reveal this horror to the public. Anyone can locate escort services, brothels, bathhouses and strip clubs in the yellow pages, newspapers, and brochures which detail the variety of girls they have to offer. As for the Trafficking business, they sought out clientele by word of mouth, on the Internet, personal references and very powerful people who were involved on the inside. This creates a distraction for the sex trade businesses, which continually harbors immigrants as slaves. The sex trade pimps are incredibly organized, know how to blend into society and stage criminal activity as though it is “business as usual.” The scary scenario is not the every day casual clients, but it is the established businessmen, the upper echelon trustees and the government officials which are also clientele.  America needs to have its eyes open to this reality which is happening twenty-four hours a day. People need to understand that the master minds behind the sex trafficking are very clever, creative, deceptive and cautious regarding their services and the way in which they enslave women against their will. It is important to understand that pimps emerge from diverse social backgrounds. The majority of the ones with which I had contact, (who were responsible for the trafficking recruitment) had attained status and wealth. Even though language barriers prevented my communication with these women, we shared the same relentless fears. Somehow, we also shared the dim ray of hope that maintained our survival. I remember, at different times, holding each of them in my arms letting their tears stain my clothing, while all along, sharing the same pain. Though English was my one advantage, I was just as lost, confused and terrified. However, within the depths of this hell I was experiencing, my will to survive was the fire which kept alive my vision of exposing trafficking to the public. Finally, I was able to escape from my master through a wealthy client who bought me for an undisclosed amount of money. He was an older gentleman with considerable influence. Through his kindness I planned my way of another escape. He admired my oriental beauty and encouraged and coached me to be a (female pimp). He bought my companionship with jewelry, money and expensive cars: He never physically abused me. With ulterior motives he taught me how to make my own money as a Las Vegas Madam (Female Pimp). Therefore, to escape the daily abuse of the sex industry, I found myself recruiting women and leading them into the same vile profession which had terribly traumatized me. I was deceived and controlled by the power it gave me. Down the road, I got to the point where I could not stomach what I was doing; repeating the very pattern which held me captive for so long. I may not have abused these women the way my Master did to me, but I did sell them. I used large amounts of narcotics to escape the reality of my immoral empire. When I realized I could not escape the recurring nightmares of women locked in basements, warehouse trucks and cheap dirty motels. I was hurled into a major mental breakdown. Coming to terms with my situation, I ran away from the ‘john’ who bought me. Fearing the possibility of being kidnapped and returned to Las Vegas, I began to seek refuge in churches, seeking their assistance in my quest for deliverance and freedom. Upon leaving Nevada, I was constantly on the run from former pimps. My life resembled a fugitive fleeing from one location to another. In the fall of 2000, I made contact with an advocate through the Internet, she advised me to relocate to a different state. Since then, I slowly began to heal, trust, and reinvent myself to return to society to make positive contributions. I long to reach out to those who are still imprisoned in the revolving door of sexual exploitation. Truly, their shackles can be broken by people who are willing to tear down the walls of silence, and offer them the hope of freedom. They robbed me of five years, they thought they could break me. Yet, I am still standing and I will stand and voice my experience for the victims who are still held in captive of human trafficking.","In the United States, slavery occurs in both legal and illicit industries, including in commercial sex, hospitality, traveling sales crews, agriculture, seafood, manufacturing, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, health care, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, drug smuggling and distribution, and child care and domestic work. Individuals who entered the United States with and without legal status have been identified as trafficking victims. Victims originate from almost every region of the world; the top three countries of origin of federally identified victims in FY 2016 were the United States, Mexico, and the Philippines. Those at particular risk of being enslaved include: children in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, runaway and homeless youth, unaccompanied children, migrant laborers, persons with limited English proficiency; persons with low literacy; persons with disabilities; and LGBTI individuals. NGOs noted an increase in cases of street gangs engaging in human trafficking.
“Dai’s” story demonstrates the process by which those who have been exploited can be coerced or forced to become exploiters themselves. “Dai” escaped her situation initially by being “bought” by a wealthy customer. She eventually left him after becoming disgusted with her role as a female pimp."
Daniela,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I was sold to a gentleman from the U.S. by my sister when I was 13 years old. I already had a baby. In the exchange, I was sold under the agreement that he would help me out with my kid because my baby was ill. I ended up being trafficked to Anchorage, Alaska. He basically kidnapped my baby away from me and didn’t allow me to see him. I was in prison, not able to see anyone for a long, long time. At that time, I was forced to have sex with men and women. Obviously, I was aware that my baby was not getting the care that we were promised. Our diet was basically rice and beans and nothing else. At the main market, at least in my case, I was 14, about to be 15, I was sold to have sex with other women. So, unfortunately my baby’s condition got worse. He never allowed me to see my baby and my baby was never provided with the medical care he needed, even when he was in the process of dying, he never thought about providing care for my baby. My baby had leukaemia at the time, but of course I didn’t know that. Probably because of my mothering instinct, one day I decided that I didn’t care what happened, I needed to take care of my baby. So I found a way to escape and to take my baby to a place in which I was pretty sure that he would get the care that he needed. But the problem was that I didn’t know where I was going, I didn’t know the area or the town or even where I was. And unfortunately my baby passed away. When I ended up getting to a place, before my baby passed away, the people that received me didn’t want to take care of my baby. After the baby passed away, due to the lack of care, I noticed that I suddenly started receiving gifts. As I think about it now, I think they were probably trying to keep my mouth shut because they didn’t want me to denounce them or anything like that. After my baby passed away, instead of burying him, they invited me to cremate my baby. It was a tough situation for me because I was only 15, so I didn’t know exactly what I was doing. After my baby was cremated, the only thing that I had to be in touch with what I felt was a part of me was the ashes. Unfortunately, he basically kidnapped the ashes and I was recaptured and put out to have sex once again. I used to cry, just asking him to allow me to touch the ashes of my baby, but he never allowed me to do that. One time, after the cremation of my baby, I was forced to have sex with a woman and him, and he was so involved with what was happening that I was able to escape through a window. I was able to make contact with a policeman and they took me to a place where they used to take minors who are in trouble. Because I didn’t know any English, they kept asking me where I was from. They kept me in the shelter for minors for a few months. I found out that the man who bought me was 33 years-old, that he had a criminal record as a sex offender, and had been involved with minors in the past. But he, as a predator, kept looking for me. After a few months in the care of the police department, I realized that I was once again pregnant. He showed up, presenting himself as a relative. He promised me that he would be gentle with me if I came back to his place. Without the support of the police department, being 15, I didn’t have any option other than to believe in him again. At least during my pregnancy he was very loving. But, after the birth of my baby, as soon as my baby was born, he put me under the care of the immigration officers. He told them that I didn’t have the capacity to care for my baby and that my first baby had passed away because I physically abused him. I was deported from Anchorage to Tijuana. Even under those conditions, I started working at a bar in Tijuana because I wanted to put some money together for airfare in order to go back to Alaska for my baby. And I ended up going back to Alaska. I was looking for my baby and then my abuser kept telling me not to leave him because he was finally in love with me. He was getting government support because he was a single father. He asked the government to facilitate the process of getting a house for the family in San Diego county. Two months after that, we got a house in San Diego and he moved himself to San Diego, but without me because I had to come back to Tijuana. He promised that he would bring my baby girl to Tijuana so I could see my daughter. But, if I wanted to see her, I had to pay him $100. My pain and suffering was just too much, so I decided to give up and think that my baby was dead in the same way that I lost my first child. I decided to stay away from him. Even though being apart from him would hurt me a lot because of my child, I knew that it was the best thing that I could do for me and for her.","There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). The US attracts migrants and refugees who are particularly at risk of vulnerability to human trafficking. Trafficking victims often responding to fraudulent offers of employment in the US migrate willingly and are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in industries such as forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation.“Daniela” (not her real name) was trafficked to the US from Mexico. She was sold by her sister and “bought” by a US man who took her and her baby to Alaska.

Daria,2008 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",South Eastern Europe (slavery location),"One day, while I was staying at the doorstep, a neighbour, called Ariana [original name changed], came up to me and said: “Come with me, you will be my little sister, you will stay some time with me; we will have a lot to eat and then we will come back again.” But she cheated me. I was 10 years old when I left with Ariana. She was older than me; she was 13 to 14 years old. We also took with us my little sister. We went to a city. I was very afraid of Ariana. She used to beat me and said very often: “I will drown you in the sea”. She introduced me to a lot of boys.... I was forced to stay with them all day long.... They gave me money and she took everything from me. She used to buy a lot of things to eat for herself and gave me nothing. We also went to the capital. There, I used to beg in the street or knock at the doors and ask for money and food. The police sent us to the police station. He [the trafficker] told to me not to tell the truth. I was so happy that the police had caught us, but in the same time I was so afraid of him.... All the time in the police station I was with him. He told the police that I was his sister and that we had come to [the destination country] to meet our father who was working there. He showed the police the family certificate (the false one). The police handed us over to the police [of our home country] in the customs post. The police [in our home country] questioned us and he told them the same story, that “I was his sister”. I couldn’t talk; I couldn’t tell them the truth. Afterwards, they set us free. We took a taxi, and in a city on our way home, we were stopped by some other policemen. I think they had doubts about us, that’s why they stopped us. I told them the truth. At that moment the guy called his father and his father communicated with the police too. He gave to the police money and they set us ‘free’. One day, a friend of mine helped me. He gave me money in order to get away from Ariana, but I wasn’t able to get away from her. I was afraid of her.... If I would return home my mother would treat me the same.... I have contacted the police several times. They sent me home. When I turned back home...the friends of my mother continued to pay visits to us every night, I remember that my uncle shouted and beat my mother because of me.... Then, after some time, I met again Ariana. I continued begging and meeting different boys and men.... One day, while Ariana was sleeping, I together with my sister went away and met a policeman in the street. We asked him for help and he returned us home again.... My mother didn’t want us back, I continued to meet with the friends of my mother...but not very often, because my mother was afraid of my uncle.","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. According to the most recent Eurostat findings, European Union (EU) citizens account for 65 percent of identified trafficked victims within Europe. These individuals mostly originate from Eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia. In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Parliament has identified corruption and the judicial system as reform challenges towards accession talks within the EU. In Greece, the turbulent economic situation has increased vulnerability for populations seeking employment and livelihood opportunities. In Greece, unemployment reached 24.4 percent in January 2016 with a youth unemployment rate of 51.9 percent. Daria describes multiple instances in which she was exploited or enslaved as a child, and the failure of the police to stop the situation."
Dorina,2017 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Romania (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I’m 24 years old and from Romania. My mother left when I was a child and my father was an alcoholic and couldn’t get any work. I left school when I was 10 and earned money through lots of different jobs in the city, but getting there and back was difficult as there wasn’t transport. I did agricultural work in the summer months. Then, I met a man who promised me a job and a house and a better life in the UK. He paid for my coach ticket to the UK, but when I arrived things were different. I was forced to have sex with lots of different men and often beaten. I was taken to lots of different places. After 2 months I managed to escape and stop a police officer in the street. He brought me to Unseen.","The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. Of those identified through the NRM, the majority were adults classified as victims of sexual exploitation followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation. The largest proportion of victims was from Albania, followed by Nigeria, Vietnam, Romania and Slovakia. Dorina was one of those brought from Romania to the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, although given false promises of work in legal industries. After escaping slavery through talking to the police, Dorina required support with accessing physical health services where she was diagnosed with and treated for numerous sexually transmitted diseases. She then chose to begin a 10-week counselling programme. She was granted 1 year discretionary leave and resettled in the UK into supported housing."
Elizabeth,2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"For over 25 years I worked as a minister’s wife alongside my husband in street outreach into project housing, poverty areas, the homeless, mission trips to Mexico, and disadvantaged people groups. Being around multiple women’s ministries gave me the opportunity to help many women from abused backgrounds. This was my passion because I had come from a background of abuse. I didn’t know how to tell what had happened to me, but I knew that compassion for these women consumed me to help them find resources, encourage them, and bring them into community with other women. In 2005, my eyes were opened to the crime of human trafficking. I soon discovered the United States was a hub for smuggling victims in for forced prostitution and other forms of slavery. The phrase “Human Trafficking” disturbed me on a personal level and I wanted to do something about it. The passing of the Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act and the phrase “Human Trafficking” gave me name of what happened to me as a child. You see, I am an adult survivor of Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking. The list of crimes perpetrated on me from the age of 13 to 17 is extensive and too horrifying to describe. This was my secret. I carried this secret with me into adulthood and I tried so hard to keep it hidden. The problem with this attempt to hide my secret, though, was that there was something terribly wrong with me. Although I had escaped my abuser, I lived in fear of him finding me because he said he would kill me – and I believed that he would because he had already tried. At age 32, I was diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder by a psychiatrist. I never went back to the psychiatrist because I was afraid everyone would think that I was crazy. I first heard the words “rape is not your fault” when I was 45 and had been married for 25 years. This secret was beginning to come out and I didn’t know what to do with it or who I could trust. I had never told my husband or my family any of the details. All anyone knew was that I had been through really bad abuse as a teenager. When I began Embassy of Hope in 2007, I wanted to help women who were victims of human trafficking. To my knowledge, no one else was doing this. Early in 2008, I was already finding victims and trying to help them. I couldn’t bring myself to tell why I wanted to work in this field because I had so much pain and couldn’t really explain my past. Also in 2008, I attended a Shared Hope International conference on Domestic Minors Sex Trafficking in Dallas. I sat in on a “Sex Crimes Detective” segment and heard a Detective name off a checklist that was only too familiar to me, “when we begin to see a child that is a chronic runaway, chronic truancy, etc., we begin to flag them as a possible victim of child sex trafficking, because we are now realizing, someone else is controlling them.” How could I tell people what I was now identifying with and learning about my childhood? My husband was on staff at a very large church and I was afraid of embarrassing him and the church. I was afraid if they found out, they would fire him. I was terrified that my past had caught up with me. Yet people still didn’t understand why I was trying to raise awareness on human trafficking and wanting to help prostitutes. I reserved the secret details for the women I began working with in order to help them identify and break free. In September 2009, the Texas Legislature signed into law that every child under the age of 18 that is involved with stripping, pornography, and prostitution is a victim of human trafficking. This law gave me the courage to begin telling my story. I finally did so in February 2010 to a group of women at a large church in San Antonio. Out of that first sharing, I was invited to train the U.S. Army MEDCOM on human trafficking and I shared my story formally, along with one of the survivors I had housed in my own home. The unique part of this story is the community that helped me survive as a 16 year old child. This community consisted of a handful of girls my age and a little older who would give me rides to church, take me out to eat with their families, give me clothes, pray with me, let me spend the night with them, and give me emotional and spiritual support. They became my family as I continued to have one foot in and one foot out of my situation. One of the girls helped me get into a trade school where I received my GED and certificate for office work. It took me two years to complete because I had to drop out so many times due to the abuse that I didn’t know how to tell anyone about. Eventually, the person responsible for my abuse had gone to prison and I was finally able to get away from him. After I got my GED, my friends helped me get my first job at a newspaper office. I was a chameleon; I hid everything because of fear and shame. This group of community helped me get back into school and made sure I had the basic things I needed. Eventually, I broke away from all of the people who were exploiting and abusing me. Had these girls and their families not been in my life, I would not have lived to my 18th birthday. Although community is vital to the restoration process, trusting that community doesn’t come easy. Even today, I still only trust people to a certain degree. I speak for myself and for the girls I’ve worked with, that we don’t want people inside our heads that have the potential to manipulate and control our outcome. I’m so blessed to have Board Members, mentors, and a few friends that I let into my life who have earned my trust. They are my community. They help me deal with life as it comes. Healing is a life-time process. I have been peeling off layers of fear and shame for years. Every time I think I’m “fixed”, I discover more layers. I was reminded of this again at a recent team meeting. Although I didn’t immediately realize it, the body language and tone of voice of some of the men during a discussion caused an unexpected reaction. I broke down, ran out of the room, and locked myself in a stall in the bathroom and cried and cried and cried. After composing myself and realizing I was having a trauma reaction, I went back into the meeting to finish. My emotions were numb and I was incredibly embarrassed and felt helpless. Later, I discussed this with a friend who is has a PhD in Trauma Recovery and I discovered I had a major flashback. It came out of nowhere. The abuses I had gone through as a child left me with PTSD and I’m told it is similar to what a soldier goes through as a prisoner of war. After all these years, I’ve discovered that I’m not “fixed” and still need a community that I can trust.","There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking exists throughout the country. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking.Elizabeth Crooks is now the Executive Director of Embassy of Hope in San Antonio, Texas, where she works to help other survivors of sexual exploitation. Elizabeth’s story demonstrates the importance of a support network like the community of girls who helped her with “emotional and spiritual,” as well as practical, support so that she could leave the situation of abuse and exploitation in which she was trapped. Elizabeth still considers community vital to the healing process, but discusses the difficulty of trusting that community: “I still only trust people to a certain degree.” Young people who run away from home are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation by traffickers: the Department of Justice estimates that 293,000 youth are at risk. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) estimates that “1 in 5 of the 11,800 runways reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2015 were likely sex trafficking victims.”"
Elsa,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"I had a happy childhood because of my adventures with my brothers and friends. Rain or shine, we play. Sometimes we cry, and go home. After we got over it, we would play again. [In the bar] I was treated as a slave who is required to follow orders whether I liked it or not. I wanted to sleep and rest… Mamasan [the manager] would come to me and tell me to approach, entertain, and even hug customers to give me drinks and take me out. Usually customers would take me out to accompany them to another bar, watch other girls dance, and get drunk. Others take me straight to their hotel and make me do things. I would feel tired every morning. Whenever I come out of the house, I felt ashamed that maybe someone would notice me. I was scared because my family might discover that I was there [in the shelter] and know all that had happened to me. I couldn’t do anything because it already happened. I thought of testifying to fight for my rights and speak of the truth. It was not my fault that I got there in the first place. My message for the bar owner and manager is: do not abuse women’s weaknesses, their desperation to find a job because of extreme need. Do not step on women’s dignity because it hurts. We are all the same; we are human, not objects nor animals that can be manipulated. A bird symbolizes my life because I'm not always caged. I'm not always trapped in one place. I feel happy now because I'm out of the bar. I will never experience those things anymore because there were people who helped me. I'm so thankful for those who helped me, for giving me the new hope to live normally as a woman and a person. Today I'm moving forward and making a better life. And I have a message for girls who are still trapped and still waiting for freedom. Do not lose hope. Don't think that you are not capable of doing greater things. You will go places, just trust in yourself. There are people who are looking for you.","There are an estimated 784,000 people living in modern slavery in the Philippines (GSI 2018).  Men, women and children are subjected forced labour and sex trafficking both within the country and in destination countries.

The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism. Rising internet usage rates, the availability of mobile phones and poverty has fostered online child sexual exploitation. Elsa's father died when she was 12. Her mother left soon afterwards and she moved with her brother to live with grandparents who could not afford food and school for her. By working as a housekeeper and janitor, she was able to keep both herself and her brother in school. But then she accepted a new job offer from a bar owner and became trapped in the sex industry. The managers used a complex system of fines and false debt to keep her and the other girls trapped. 16 victims, including Elsa, were freed by police during an operation in 2013. She went on to testify against the traffickers during their trial. She wrote and told her story in 2016 while in her early twenties and a college student. ""Elsa"" is a pseudonym."
Ester,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"I am Ester. My life is not yet beautiful; I still have plenty of problems. The place where I lived as a child was mountainous and cold. I lived with my lola [grandmother] as a young baby and then I was brought by my mother to stay in Cebu with my paternal lola. I have three half-sisters and two half-brothers. As a child I felt sadness because my mother and father quarrelled and I was moved around a lot. We were very poor and I was always told that I was such a burden to care for. When I was six years old I was raped by my step-brothers when I was staying with my father and stepmother. No one knew about this. Later I was raped by my paternal uncle and when I went to my aunty’s her husband sexually harassed me. When I was nine I went and lived with my aunty as a house helper. At first, I thought that she was good. She treated me nicely and I said to myself, “I hope this is not only plastic.” But I was wrong. Within a month she showed her true colours. She mistreated me. She treated me like an animal. I did all the housework and she shouted at me and every time she wanted to do something she yelled and physically abused me. If I could live my childhood again I would have many toys, many playmates, food, and my parents would be loving towards me. They would take care of me and I would have plenty of friends to play with. At the age of 15 I fell pregnant. The father of my baby was 50 years old and I was sold by my aunty to that man because they were friends. We started living together when I was 14 and I gave birth at 15. I was really forced to go with that old man because I wanted to get away from my aunty. It was like clinging to a blade – I had to just to get away from my aunty, and I thought it would be good to go with this man but I was wrong. At first he seemed good, he promised to buy me a house and to provide everything but these promises were not fulfilled. He didn’t even buy a container for our plates. And after I gave birth he did not have anything for the baby. He had lots of fun with his friends but he neglected me. At 16 I separated from this man because I could not endure his behaviour. He was jealous and controlling and possessive. I ran away from him but he found me and physically abused me. Eventually I went to Cebu City where I worked as a dancer in a disco bar. I had a pimp there under the arrangement of my mother; he would pick up customers for me. That pimp really treated me like a pig. I had to obey him just to get the money. The first customer I had took me to a hotel. I really had no idea. I was bothered and I started crying and the customer said, “What, you don’t know what your job is?” and I told him, “This is my first time, so I really don’t have an idea” and I cried a lot and I appealed to the customer. So he said to me, “OK, you want the pimp to be arrested? I can help you,” but I said, “No, just take me home” and the customer gave me money but he did not have sex with me. He just took me home. I was very angry at my mum but I could not show it to her, so I just said to myself, “What kind of a mother is she, to pimp her own daughter?” I was so angry but I had no power to show it to her because she was also under the power of her husband and they didn’t want me to stay in their house. That first customer explained to me that the pimp and my mother could be charged with trafficking and he told me to call him if I needed help. I was happy that this man understood me and offered to help me so I just stayed in my house for two weeks. However, I was concerned about how I could feed my baby, how I could have money, so I decided to go into prostitution because that’s the only way I knew I could get some money. I became a ‘pick-up girl’. I arranged with another pimp to collect well-to-do customers. He would text me when a customer was available and I would give his some of the profits. After a while I maintained my own regular customers. I no longer needed the pimp; I received all the profits. There were also instances when I got customers who were foreigners. They would organise a tour. Me and sometimes two or three of us would accompany them on a tour and I would make big money. I was there only as a guide, there was no sex involved. I enjoyed this touring because there was plenty of food and it was very expensive and extravagant. Even though we were prostitutes, they treated us very well. We three girls had one room and we could sleep and wake up when we liked. It was really a good experience. Pick-up girls stay on the streets not because they want sex. In my case, I did not become a pick- up girl because of sex. The reason I was pushed to become a pick-up girl was because of money. I needed money. The other girls, they needed money. That is why they stayed pick-up girls. If we had money then we wouldn’t be standing on the streets looking for customers. If there was an opportunity where there would be money and no sex, we would appreciate that very much. The incident that really made me give up being a call girl was when I was abused by my last customer. It was 3am and I was in a disco bar and about to go home when I was called by a pimp to take a customer. I was not feeling well, I think I was sick, so I refused, but the pimp insisted because he said the customer would pay very well. So I was really forced to come. The customer was in his forties and he was very fat and he was very drunk. He was staying in a nearby hotel. He asked me to get in a bathtub full of water and it made me feel even sicker because I was shivering and being dipped in the water. That was very bad for me but I had to do it. I was a little bit drowned for some seconds and then he pulled me up and made me have sex in several positions. There was a moment after the bathtub incident that we were bathing under the shower and he bumped his head against the wall because he was so drunk. He then bumped my head against the wall, saying “I was hurt, you also must be hurt”. I was abused physically and sexually by this man. He demanded to have sex many times. I said, “If you take juice first you will have more energy.” I came up with this strategy to save myself because I saw on the table plenty of pills, including sleeping pills. So when he got his phone, his butt was on me, I got the sleeping pills and put them in the juice. I forced him to drink the juice, explaining to him that he would have more energy for sex. So he took the juice and after some seconds he was asleep and I dressed and ran away. Once I got outside of the hotel I didn’t have any energy anymore. I just stood against the wall and dropped. I was so sad because I thought at that time that I had no hope, I had no future, and people would sneer at me. I could feel it; they did not respect me anymore. I even said to myself at that time that I could die anytime, it would not matter. The last word I have about trafficking is that I hope people will understand why we are prostituted. I hope that they will understand that we are there not because we want sex but because we need money to support ourselves and other people who depend on us. I hope people will understand, and respect us, and not put us down. When I see someone who is trafficked now, I really pity the girl because I know how difficult it is to be trafficked.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Esther,2013 (Narrative date),Forced marriage,North Korea (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"Hello. My name is Esther Choe, and I am currently living as a new American citizen, which I consider to be a great honor. Through the grace of God, whom I believe in, and also through the help of a Korean-American missionary named Phillip Buck, I was able to be resettled in the United States via the UNHCR [UN Refugee Agency]. As the airplane I was in was flying into America, I saw the land below me brightly lit up with electricity, as if sparkling jewels were splashed about. And I remember thinking to myself that if I had this kind of electricity and lights, I would have never left behind my child in my hometown and escaped from North Korea. I woke up every morning at 5 o’clock am and worked until 11 o’clock p.m. At night, working and doing needlework under an oil lamp. Since there was no electricity, I had to use my legs to turn the sewing machine and used briquettes to heat the iron needed to iron clothes. And I was also in great pain because I was working all day with my head bent down. During the wintertime, I also had to endure the bitter cold. Because the sewing work I did to try to feed my family was not enough, I decided to go to China to earn extra income. Just like many North Korean citizens hear about the outside world from North Korean defectors, I too found out information about China from a woman from my hometown who had been repatriated from China. I sought her out and heard many great stories about China. What I heard from her surprised me immensely. In China, just by working for a family at a house as a babysitter, one could earn approximately 1.2 million North Korean yuan. Since I could earn in 1 month what it would take me months of hard work in North Korea, I made a decision to go to China. In North Korea, the trains do not run regularly, so if a person wanted to go visit a relative or go somewhere else to work or sell goods, it would take up to 2 months of travel. And I thought that if I went to China and came back, I would not arouse suspicion or be detected. And through the contacts introduced to me by the North Korean defector woman who had been arrested and repatriated to North Korea, I crossed into China via the Tumen River. That evening when I arrived in China, I changed clothes and got into a car and rode for 14 hours. I naturally thought that I was being taken to a place where the contacts would introduce me to a new job. But once we arrived at our destination, I realized that I was getting involved in a human trafficking situation. And I started to cry and plead with the people who had taken me in. I begged and pleaded with them that I was a married woman with a child and a husband and that I needed to go back to my home, but they were cold and detached in their response. The human traffickers said that they had invested money and 14 hours of their own time to bring me to my destination, so they needed to at least break even financially, and though they could not help me right at the moment, after I was sold, depending on the situation, they would try to send me back home. The place where I was sold to in tears for 16,000 Chinese yuan was to a Chinese man in his 50s who was still not married because he was so poor and had no money. And this man was living with his 80-year-old mother in a very poor and destitute situation. Because he was afraid I would run away, I was followed everywhere, even to the bathroom, to the stream near the house, wherever I went. When they needed to leave the house, I was locked inside the house and I could not leave. For 2 months, I spent the time just crying, thinking about my child and my husband and how to get back to them, and looking for the right moment to escape. And when I did barely escape, I went to look for and sought out the broker who had sold me. I cried and begged with the broker again to send me back home to my family, but this broker, who had no humanity in him, instead of showing compassion and kindness, looked at me as a way to make a profit and instead sold me to another old, unmarried farmer in the countryside. I really had no hope to continue living and wanted to die, but I thought of my child back home and just barely survived and succeeded in escaping again. And knowing that I had a distant relative who lived in China, I made inquiries looking for my aunt and found her. Other North Korean defector women have been caught trying to escape from trafficking and have been beaten mercilessly. And some women are locked up for months and mistreated, and some are even forced to become pregnant so that they cannot escape. There are countless stories like these, but I believe that God protected me, and I was able to escape successfully. The last place I escaped from, there were four other North Korean refugee woman who had been sold and were trafficked into that location. Among the four, the most pitiful one was a 15-year old girl who was intentionally falsely announced as a 19-year-old and then sold. She was sold to a 35-year-old single man and one day escaped successfully. And she, too, sought out her broker who had sold her in order to try to get back home, but I heard that she, too, was sold again to another human trafficking situation. I was sold twice by human traffickers in China, and in that time I found God and also found my relative. And through this relative’s help, I was able to meet Pastor Phillip Buck and then was able to find help from the UNHCR. I truly believe myself to be a woman who found great fortune and luck in finding this help. Even now, there are so many North Korean refugee women who are going through extreme difficulties and hardships and being sold in these human trafficking situations. There are countless North Korean refugee women who are sold into Internet online sex sites and into karaoke bars. And because they want to keep their chastity and virginity, some try to commit suicide. If caught, they are beaten and abused until literally bones break and then handed over to the Chinese police, who then repatriate them in North Korea at the hands of the Bowibu, the national security agency agents. These women are then tortured and beaten and called dirty women and prostitutes who sold their bodies. And many die silent deaths like this. Some women are forced to have babies with men they are sold to. And when they are arrested and forcibly separated by the Chinese police, the North Korean refugee mother will cry out in broken Chinese, ""I will come back for my baby."" There are countless women like these. I really did not want to come here and testify today because I too want to live a happy life and I too want to meet a nice person and because I also fear that harm may come to my husband and child, from whom I am separated for life because I cannot return now to North Korea. However, I am here today because I want to tell the world about what is going on and appeal to the world and be a voice for the countless North Korean women and the mothers of the North Korean children who died and were killed in trying to keep their honor. Right now, Kim Jong Un and the regime is testing nuclear weapons and threatening the world and claiming that they are strong. They must feel ashamed and embarrassed that their own citizens have become targets of derision and ridicule in the world and that their own people are being sold like animals and mistreated in another country. And when the people were tearfully trying to survive and eat, the regime took the aid and the food that the international community sent and instead used that make weapons to threaten the world that only desires peace. They must feel ashamed that they are the leaders of such a brazen-faced nation. I also sincerely pray that God and the whole world will judge the regime that does not even care for or plan anything for its own people. And I earnestly plead that the world will help the weak and helpless North Korean refugee women who are dying today from hardships that are far worse than what I endured. I close my testimony by asking for God’s blessings, the blessings that he has bestowed on me to be with all of you here today in this place and with all the people who have a heart and compassion for the people of North Korea and who will help the North Korean defectors. Thank you.","Esther was a textile worker in North Korea when she learned that she could make 20 times the amount of her current pay caring for children in China, so she decided to go to work for a short period of time. She was subsequently caught in human trafficking and was sold as a ‘‘wife’’ to a Chinese man who locked her up. After she escaped, with no one to help her, she went back to the trafficker who sold her and pled for him to help her get back home. But, instead, he sold her again to another Chinese man. Through the help of an American Pastor, she was able to escape to the United States in 2008."
Evalina,2008 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Europe (slavery location),"I tried to escape, but they beat me cruelly. I managed to run away together with another 14-year-old girl to a family where we lived for two weeks. One day, when I went to buy some bread, I was detained by the police and sent to a temporary shelter. I spoke with a girl who also wanted to run away. We did not speak openly about that in order not to be denounced. I ran away with that girl, who had the key to an apartment of a friend of hers who lived in the suburbs of the city. We stayed there around two weeks in order to be convinced that no one was chasing us. Then we phoned some relatives at home. I tried to run away three times. Two times I was caught and beaten severely. I succeeded in running away only the third time. I got acquainted with a woman from my country who took me to her place and we lived together. One month later she helped me to get work as a waitress. It was she who advised me to go to the police. When I caught on how things stood, I started coming out on the street earlier than the other girls, so they don’t see me, and I made some money to call my grandmother and tell her what I was doing.... I asked my grandmother how I could get away. She talked to the police in our village and they told her that if I went to the police and said that I was a minor, they would help me come back home. There was also another girl belonging to the same pimp who had told me the same thing. But she had advised me that it would be better to wait for a police patrol car to pass by in the area so I could tell them and they could take me away from there. Otherwise, I might not be able to reach the police station, as we were being watched. So this is what I did. I tried to escape but they locked me in and beat me. When I found out that I was pregnant, the pimps threatened me with an abortion. So once, when they took me to a client, I jumped from the second floor. I hid myself, but some girls helped me to find my friend with whom I had departed in the beginning and who worked for another pimp. She took me to an apartment, gave me money and took me to the train. It was impossible to escape as they watched me day and night. A client who was also a lawyer put pressure on the trafficker to buy me a return ticket to my country. I told three clients that I had been kidnapped from home and that I’m a minor. But they told the owner about it, because they didn’t care. But one of the clients said that he would save me from the club.... Then, I gave him the telephone number of a schoolmate and asked him to convey the message “[name] is expecting you in [city]”. Following this call, my school friend understood that something bad was happening and called my parents. My mother immediately notified the police.","Despite having the lowest regional prevalence of modern slavery in the world, Europe remains a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source region for the exploitation of men, women and children in forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. According to the most recent Eurostat findings, European Union (EU) citizens account for 65 percent of identified trafficked victims within Europe. These individuals mostly originate from Eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia. In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Parliament has identified corruption and the judicial system as reform challenges towards accession talks within the EU. In Greece, the turbulent economic situation has increased vulnerability for populations seeking employment and livelihood opportunities. In Greece, unemployment reached 24.4 percent in January 2016 with a youth unemployment rate of 51.9 percent. “Evalina” describes numerous attempts to escape from her sexual exploitation as a child, including contacting family members, jumping from the window, and telling her clients about her situation. She described her situation as “impossible to escape” because she was always being watched."
Fawziya,2014 (Narrative date),War slavery,Iraq (trafficked from),Iraq (slavery location),Narrative provided by Amnesty International in the report 'Escape from Hell: Torture and Sexual Slavery in Islamic State Captivity in Iraq',"ISIS has singled out the Yezidi minority, notably its women and children, for particularly brutal treatment. In August 2014, ISIS fighters abducted hundreds, possibly thousands, of Yezidi men, women and children who were fleeing the IS takeover from the Sinjar region, in the north-west of the country. Hundreds of the men were killed and others were forced to convert to Islam under threat of death. Younger women and girls, some as young as 12, were separated from their parents and older relatives and sold, given as gifts or forced to marry ISIS fighters and supporters. 
Fawziya was abducted in August 2014 and was held in her captor's home with his family. She was 18 years old during her enslavement and when she told her story in late 2014."
Florida,2014 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",Uzbekistan (slavery location),"I’m studying at the Andijan Agricultural Institute, the Faculty of Economics. Due to the days of mourning, classes began on September 4th. On September 8th, our curator said that starting September 10th we all will go and pick cotton. I rested a day at home, but more like gathered my things for the departure. I took my bed, bedsheets, clothes and food. Had to buy few things to wear though. Besides I took 10 pieces of flat bread, sugar, butter, condensed milk, biscuits, gingerbread and medicines. I spent 600 thousand Uzbek Sums ($95) to buy food and clothing needed for cotton-picking. Two warm trousers cost me 50 thousand Uzbek Sums. I also bought 8 warm socks, jacket, jumper, slippers, and underwear. My relatives will need another 600 thousand Sums to visit me while I am gone for cotton picking. We were ordered to gather near the Institute at 6am on September 10th. Having spent 20 thousand Sums for the road expenses, I arrived at 6.30am. My uncle helped me get to the destination. At 9 am our column set off towards the area called Sawai of Kurgantepa district. We were accommodated in local school. There were approximately 2000 students from my institute. We were placed in different schools though. At the school where we were placed, were mainly our classmates from the same year. It was two-story school. Boys were placed at the gym and those who did not get a corner in the gym were placed in the corridors and in the lobby. Girls were placed in classrooms on the first and second floors. Rooms were emptied before we arrived. Only blackboards were left. Despite the fact that the beginning of the school year was close, classrooms were not repaired and looked pretty old. There were holes in the walls and the wind blowing through them. This year the weather is a little bit cold. No matter how sunny the day is, there was cold wind blowing. So glad I took warm clothes with me. But my feet are still cold. Mom told me to take makhsi (national leather shoes), but I was too shy to do so. Many girls wear makhsi over here. I took overshoes, slippers and sneakers. When I leave for picking cotton, especially in the mornings and evenings, my feet get cold. My aunt, also student earned rheumatism 2 or 3 years ago during the cotton harvest. She fainted during the cotton harvest. Local doctors kept her at the hospital until midnight. Then a friend of my aunt secretly called her mother at home. They arrived immediately and called the ambulance. My aunt had a surgery the same day. She had an intestines’ obstruction. Parents of my aunt spent a lot of money on her treatment back then. There was a lot of noise in the institute. I am scared and so I am wearing warm clothes. It has been a week since we are here. Every day, we collect 50-60 kg of cotton. What we earn covers only food expenses. At school where we live, there are almost no conditions. There is always a line to go to the bathroom. There are two toilets for boys and two for girls. No shower though. There is a long piece of steel tube. There are 3-4 holes in it for water to come out. We wash our faces and hands by 3-4 people standing in a row next to the tube. The water is cold. In the mornings in the courtyard in the samovar there is boiled water for tea. When we run out of boiled water, there is nothing left but to drink cold water. Everyone eats their own bread and as we drink tea. By the way, in the Khait days we were given bread twice. It is good I took sugar and butter. We share with friends and eat. Some girls did not bring any food with them. They probably did not know. There are 14 girls in every room. All split into 2-3 teams and eat. We wake up at 5 am. By the time we have breakfast and brush teeth it is already 6.30 am. Then they bring us to the cotton field. They take us by bus when it is far or we walk when it’s close. We have lunch right in the field at 1pm. We weight what we collected before 12 pm. Then we have a lunch. Sometimes we are given mastava (rice soup) or pasta. We had pilaf in Khait days. Once they made “dimlama” (fried). There was mainly pumpkin in the “dimlama”. Due to the fact that I do not like pumpkin, I could not have “dimlama”. Returning from the cotton picking back to dorm I bought cookies at the local shop. Mom left 50 thousand Sums in cash for minor expenses. In the evening at 6 pm we leave the field and weigh harvested cotton. Dinner takes place in the field again. For the dinner we are normally given watery soup. We are girls, but the boys stay hungry after the dinner. Not everyone has enough food. After such an awful food we head off back to dorm for get some sleep. They boil water in samovar again. Generally it is boiled to wash our hands, but we make tea and eat our supplies. Then we go to bed. The school building is bad because when we need to go to the bathroom during the night, we have no other way but to pass through sleeping boys. They sleep undressed. We are ashamed. We are not so close with each other. As senior year students said conditions were better last year. Students were given breakfasts and dinners in the sleeping area. They said: – “This year there is no the president of the state anymore … That’s why it is so different.” We have not been paid for harvested cotton yet. Every day we pay for food that we eat. Can’t believe we will keep suffering? It would be better not to come. We have 5-6 people who did not come to the cotton. They paid $300 each. One of them is Khakim’s nephew. He did not pay for as far as I know. He shared this info with our girls. Our rates are slightly less expensive. My friend studies at the medical institute. Administration did not agree to release from cotton picking even for $400. She was asked to pay $500. Now she is picking cotton in Ulugnor district. They said, cotton picking will last for a month only. Whether I am here on my own will? I would never in my life pick cotton. Those who do not show up to pick cotton, especially freshmen, quickly expelled from studies through fake reasoning such as failing to pay tuition fees. Senior year students suggested picking cotton slowly, just formally. I am thinking whether I should tell my father. I cannot stay here anymore. What will I do if I get ill here? Father is coming back from Kazakhstan in the end of the year. Money that he earned there will be spent to renovate our house and to pay for my studies. Besides that, money is needed to feed me and my brothers until spring. I am thinking if I should take $300 and pay for cotton. But it would mean that I am taking my brothers’ share. I have no strength left. You work like a slave from morning till night, not enough food, and should sleep and wake up hungry again. Feeling homesick. Other girls say the same. Tomorrow mom and uncle will come visit me. Even though I call them every day, I still miss them. When mom asked me what to cook and bring, I said 3-4 meals. I know I asked too much from my mother, but I am starving here. Sometimes I think “God when this is over!” If mom comes two more times to visit me, it will come to $300 in total. Would be better if she didn’t come. I am not sure if I will be paid for the collected cotton. And the cotton is not good; not a lot of cotton actually. I overheard a conversation between two farmers. Cotton was exposed to insects and was harmed in the summer. May God grant patience to the end of cotton!!! Taking baths? They say will bring us there tomorrow. After lunch, we leave cotton not at 6 pm, but at 5 pm. Only girls will be taken to baths. Boys will go another day. Will also wash our clothes. Good that I took the soap and washing powder. I have spent 18 thousand out of 50 that my mom gave me. I do not know how much they pay per kg. They said 250 Sum per kg. Some boys do not collect. Others collect on their behalf. A boy named Abbos from our course, said that he buys 50 kg of cotton for 16 thousand sum. We have some students who pick cotton well, especially girls. There are 7-8 of them. They collect up to 100 kg. But for 5 days they were paid only 30 thousand to 40 thousand Sums. We were surprised. They were to receive 200 thousand. Then they said the money was deducted because of the meals. Since I collect a little, they said will deduct from my first semester’s stipend. Eh, let this cotton be over, let’s wait and see!","According to the United States Trafficking in Persons report 2017, government-compelled child labour in Uzbekistan was phased out in 2015, although there were anecdotal reports of the use of child labour in some areas. Government-compelled forced labour of adults, including employees of schools and medical facilities, remain widespread during the fall cotton harvest, spring planting and weeding, and for other agriculture and construction projects. Credible international reports indicate some adults who refuse to pick cotton, do not pay for a replacement worker, or do not fulfil their daily quota can face the loss of social benefits, termination of employment, or other forms of harassment. Private companies in some regions mobilized employees for the harvest under threat of increased government inspections of and taxes on their operations. There were anecdotal reports of officials mobilizing classes of students aged 11 to 15 years in some regions, in contravention of the central government’s prohibition on child labour. Mobilizations of university and third-year college and lyceum (equivalent to a U.S. high school) students, who tend to be 18 years old but include some 17-year olds, continued in 2016. Independent observers reported that, in recent years, forced mobilization of adult workers increased to compensate for the loss of child workers. ""Florida"" details what life is like for students who are forced to pick cotton."
Grace,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Domestic slavery,Nigeria (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,Germany (slavery location),"I worked day and night for months, doing everything they asked me, in order to get the money for my madam; and every day I cried. If I came home (I lived with my traffickers) without enough money, my madam would seriously reprimand and abuse me. And, after servicing clients, I would often have to wash dishes and take care of the children in the house. I worked for seven months and was told by my various employers that I had to have sex without condoms when asked. Men demanded sex without condoms. At a well-known legal brothel, the owners told me directly that I had to have sex without condoms, otherwise I would be fired. The owners would ask the clients afterwards if they were happy, if I willingly serviced them without a condom. My madam wanted me to do it without a condom. She said that I was no better than the other girls, and I should do what the brothels wanted to earn more and pay her back. I wouldn’t be able to pay off the debt if I couldn’t work, so I did it. The women here are so desperate for money that they don’t care about AIDS—people here are ready to die. This is blood money, and it was killing me, too. Seven months after I started, police carried out a check on the brothel and they asked me if I was working there voluntarily. I was very scared and, remembering the oath I had sworn before leaving Nigeria, I said “yes.” They looked over my papers and, realizing they weren’t mine, arrested me and took me to the immigration detention centre. While there I became sick, vomiting, and was brought to a hospital. I found out then that I had AIDS. My madam managed to track me down after I left the hospital and told me that I had to continue being a prostitute to pay for the remaining debt, which she said was still more than half of the 50,000 euro. I refused and she started threatening me and my family back home, who begged me to comply. By then, I had become acquainted with SOLWODI, and they helped me to get settled and exit prostitution. I refused to go back to my madam and eventually reported her and her accomplices to the police. I am very mixed up now. Sometimes I have high hopes for the future and other times I feel very beaten down. I do not want to go back to Nigeria and I know I would be at risk there. I have a partner now who accepts me for who I am and the support of SOLWODI, which makes me happy. However, I wish people would tell parents that it is good to educate girls and get them proper job training, rather than sending them into prostitution. A child is a gift of God, whether it is a man or a woman. Women are not slaves and traffickers should stop taking other people’s children. No one should be forced; buyers, pimps and traffickers are killing human beings and spreading sickness. They should prostitute themselves if they want money! Some people are paying 90,000-100,000 euro to buy people. Stopping the sex industry would be the best, it should not exist—that’s blood money! When I was in the sex industry, I prayed that someone would take me away. If men would be charged, given severe punishments, it would stop.","Grace was educated until the 10th grade in Nigeria, after which she was sent to work to help support her family, who lived in poverty. She worked for three years at various jobs, during which time she was raped and gave birth to a son. Her father told her that as a woman, she was “predestined by God to save her family from poverty by going to Europe to earn money.” He introduced her to a woman whose sister lived in Germany. Grace was told that she would have to repay the travel costs by working for the woman’s sister, after which she could work as a babysitter or in a restaurant to send money back home. Grace didn’t have an understanding of the amount she would have to repay, because the amount was in German currency, but she decided to take the chance because she didn’t have better prospects for her life in her country and her family was pressuring her. As is typical in her community, she underwent a Juju (Voodoo) ritual where she swore never to betray the contact in Germany and that she would pay all the debts. Grace talks about how she believes the problem of sexual exploitation should be addressed, based on her experiences."
Hakim,2015 (Narrative date),Forced labour Debt bondage,India (trafficked from) Debt bondage,India (slavery location),"We have been ‘bandua’ (bonded labourers) to the fearless since childhood. We have faced their torment. I had seen first at my father’s times and now am suffering it myself. My ancestral house is definitely Kohdaar but I have never been able to stay here. We were all small when my father came with us to Lohgara. We used to break stones at a fearless man’s place. Both my parents broke stones there and soon my sister and me also got along in breaking stones there. We were Bandua so there was no question of reading and writing. And on top of this the contractor came every June and forced my father to work and abused us. The contractor was such a tyrant that he took out the pistol in everything. My father said once a worker was late in coming for work so the contractor pulled put the trigger in the pistol and killed the man. When the tyranny of the contractor increased we entire family left Lohgara and came to our village Kohdaar. When 3- 4 days passed one day my maternal grandmother came running and said the contractor could even come there so fearing it we ran away from there. There was tyranny of big people here too so 2 years back we again came back to kohdaar from Chandi. This time we did not go to the village but instead we made a house at the mountains and have been staying here. Though we still fear the Lohgara contractor. After coming here we have been breaking stones for Bhanu Prasad. When there is need we have to take loans from him only. Meanwhile my father got sick so the loan money increased and it amounted to Rs 35,000 that time. Other than breaking stones I have been riding his tractor since 6 months. 2 months back an accident had accoutred when the tractor was being taken out from the minefield. I got a fracture in the leg. For some days the contractor got me treated but he left later on. I have to now get myself treated on my own. I have spent many thousands so far. The contractor has added the money spent on the treatment in the loan money which has increased. My wife is about to deliver a baby at home now and a lot of money will be spent on that too. After getting hurt I am not able to work anywhere else. We had run away from Lohgaar from the tyranny of the contractor and if we run away from here sorrows would end but I feel now bad fate is never going to leave our side. Cause of my father being a bonded labour it is difficult to lead our lives normally and if I too remain a bonded labour my children’s future too would be the same. But I have thought that once my leg becomes better I will go and earn money and repay the contractor’s loans and will make my children study.","India has a population of more than 1.3 billion people, there are still at least 270 million people living on less than US$1.90 per day. While laws, systems and attitudes regarding key 'fault lines' such as the caste system, gender and feudalism are rapidly changing, social change of this depth and scale necessarily takes time. In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, including intergenerational bonded labour, forced child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced recruitment into nonstate armed groups and forced marriage. Hakim describes the inter-generational nature of the kind of bonded labour he is subject to, having entered this kind of slavery as a small child when his father became bonded. He worries that if he stays in bonded labour that his children will be forced to do the same, and expresses a hope that he can pay off the contractor’s debt so that his children can get an education."
Henriette (Narrative 2),2015 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery Forced labour,Togo (trafficked from) Forced labour,France (slavery location),"My name is Henriette Akofa. I come from Togo. When I was 14 years old, a Togolese woman named Simone, proposed to my family to bring me to Paris in France to help her at home. On my return, I would go to school. It would give me a better life than I had. But that wasn't true. On the first dayafter my arrival in January, I was given just two blankets. One I put on the ground to sleep on. The other was to cover myself. It was terribly cold for someone coming from Africa. Immediately, I realised that I had made a mistake. I should not have agreed to leave with this woman. Things got worse. Everyday, I had to do all the household chores. I didn't go to school because I didn't have any documents. Each month, I was allowed rations of one kilogram of tomatoes, five kilograms of potatoes, six litres of milk and a packet of cereal. On my arrival, I met an older girl called Stephanie, whom I didn't know. I slept alongside her on the floor. The next day, I woke up and tried to sleep on the sitting room sofa but within minutes, Simone woke me brusquely to say that I was only allowed to sleep in a corner of the kitchen. A few minutes later, Simone explained what she wanted us to do. We would iron and fold clothes and then put them in bags. We would cut, clean and sew fabric and take it to her clothes shop. Scarves, belts, jewelery - all the fashion accessories. We would go to embassies, UNESCO, and to the offices of Simone's friends, we noted what was bought and we would return everyday to get the money for the purchases. After six months, I told Simone that I didn't trust her. I didn't want to sell for her anymore. I wanted to go back to Togo. She didn't believe me at first and laughed. I refused to eat what she gave me until I went back to Togo. I lasted a few weeks until Simone realised I was serious. She proposed that I work for another woman who would give me the money to return home. That wasn't true. The woman told me that she paid a lot of money to Simone to bring me a girl to help with household chores, as she was about to have her third child. So I didn't get any money and couldn't go home. Simone tried to get me back but the woman threatened that she would report her to the police if she continued. I didn't see her again. The few souvenirs I had of my family remained with Simone. A few days later, the woman gave birth to her third child. I had a mattress on the floor, next to the cot of Raphael. I slept on the floor, changed nappies, prepared food and milk bottles. I did all the chores, the shopping, and took the older child to school, and looked after the two younger children at home. I was a slave. The only difference was that they didn't buy me from my parents. But they betrayed my trust and that of my parents. Slaves at least know that they have been bought. I was promised education in return for my help. I knew that what was happening to me was unfair because I had a family before and knew how human beings should be treated. I said to myself everyday, to where can I run? I arrived at 14 years old and always tried to telephone my parents so that they could tell me what to do but I didn't have the country code. I tried but never made contact. There was no break. It was 24 hours none-stop service. I was the first to wake up and the last to sleep. Sometimes, when I did sleep, they told me that I had not worked properly and was punished. I had no friends, no money, no documents and nowhere to go. The only time I knew where I was was when I was with the children. The youngest child was always on my back whilst I work, showered him and prepared food. When there were five children, I had washing, food to make, cleaning, 24 hours a day. Never a break. That lasted five years without salary or papers or free time. There was no future. I felt like the protector of the children. My faith allowed me to survive. I said to myself that if you don't harm others, you won't end up in a bad situation.","In France, there is a pervasive problem of women and children being subjected to domestic servitude, mostly in cases in which families exploit relatives brought from Africa to work in their households. Trafficking networks have expanded to operate in large towns outside of Paris, including Lille, Marseille, Chartres, Toulouse, and Nice. 
Henriette Siliadin became an enslaved domestic worker after her arrival in France at the age of 14. She was eventually helped by the Comité contre l’esclavage moderne (CCEM) (Committee against Modern Slavery), which works with victims of domestic slavery and forced labour in France."
Htay,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,"",Thailand (slavery location),"Our boat was stealing fish from Indonesian waters. We were chased many times by Indonesian boats. People said we would be killed in Indonesia if we got caught. When the Captain saw the boat on the radar, they told us to pull up the nets as soon as possible, and then flee away. The brokers told me that if I did not want to go, I should look at this gun because I could be killed very easily. They said a bullet only costs 12 baht. I was really frightened to get on the boat, because I had heard stories of people being sold on the boat. I was really afraid. On the boat, I was unhappy everyday. Sometimes I even felt like jumping into the sea.","In March 2013, 14 victims aged between 16 and 46 years, and all from Myanmar, were rescued by local police from a fishing port and processing factory in Kantang where they were being held by brokers. Most of the victims had just returned from six months at sea, on three separate fishing vessels. Despite receiving no pay, by selling dried squid to the boat they transferred fish to, one of the group was able to save enough money to buy a mobile phone and SIM card. This enabled them to alert one of the other victim’s family members, who contacted a helpline for reporting human trafficking to secure their rescue. EJF interviewed six victims, none of whom had ever been on a fishing boat, or even seen the sea before being trafficked. They gave accounts of being deceived by brokers who told them they would be working in factories. They reported being beaten or seeing others beaten, and working in arduous conditions onboard the fishing vessels. Three of the victims had been trafficked from within Thailand, whilst working in a chicken factory in the north of the country. A visiting broker had told them that he would secure them a better job in another factory, with higher wages. ""Htay"" discusses that, in addition to forcing labour on the fishing ships, the perpetrators in this case were also committing illegal fishing in Indonesian waters."
Hung,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Vietnam (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"When I was 16, my parents borrowed £5000 to pay agents to find me work. I journeyed by plane, bus and lorry. It took three months to get to the UK. In France, with other Vietnamese boys, I was sealed in a crate which was placed inside a lorry. When we were met in England, I was told I must work off my debt. I was taken to a house to be a gardener in a cannabis farm. We were locked in, forced to work long hours. There were toxic chemicals. We slept and ate in the ‘farm’, the windows were sealed. When I asked for my money, I was threatened. Six months later the police raided the house. I didn’t speak English, I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know who to trust. No one believed I was 16, and I had no ID. I was taken to court and sentenced to 18 months in prison. After a year, the full facts emerged. I was released. ECPAT [Every Child Protected Against Trafficking] UK have helped me. I still have a criminal record. I don’t want to go home.","Cases of modern slavery have been uncovered in diverse sectors and locations of the United Kingdom—from Vietnamese children locked into Manchester flats to grow cannabis to Albanian women and girls sexually exploited in the London sex industry, and to the hundreds of men working low or semi-skilled jobs trapped in situations of debt bondage. The National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. Hung’s experience demonstrates various difficulties of being both a child survivor of slavery and an immigrant without legal status, especially those who do not speak the language of the destination country. In Hung’s case, his age could not be verified by authorities, and therefore he was not treated as a minor. Despite eventually being released from prison, he still has a criminal record."
Idora,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Nigeria (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was trafficked from Nigeria two years ago. I was training as a primary school teacher. A man befriended me, offered a cleaning job in the UK earning me enough to go to university – my dream. Before leaving, he made me participate in a witchcraft ceremony, drinking a mixture of the inside of a hen, and making me promise never to disobey him or else I would go mad. I received false documents, including a script of what to tell border officials in the UK. I was picked up at the airport and driven to a house in London. I was locked in a room with three other women and then sexually exploited. The witchcraft ceremony back in Nigeria haunted me. I was moved to different flats, working as a sex worker in all of them. This went on for months. When the police raided our flat, I was placed in a detention centre and then a hostel. The traffickers threatened to harm my mother in Lagos if I didn’t return as a sex worker. I had to go back. A further seven months passed till I was rescued by a police raid. I was placed in City Hearts shelter, which helped and supported me. Perhaps, my university dream can now come true.","The UK National Crime Agency estimates 3,309 potential victims of human trafficking came into contact with the State or an NGO in 2014. The latest government statistics derived from the UK National Referral Mechanism in 2014 reveal 2,340 potential victims of trafficking from 96 countries of origin, of whom 61 percent were female and 29 percent were children. Of those identified through the NRM, the majority were adults classified as victims of sexual exploitation followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation. The largest proportion of victims was from Albania, followed by Nigeria, Vietnam, Romania and Slovakia. Idora was enslaved in sex work after being promised lucrative cleaning work in the UK to help her save for a university education. Her story highlights that those who escape slavery may yet feel forced to return because of threats made against their lives, or those of their family members."
Jana,2010 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bosnia (trafficked from),Slovenia (slavery location),"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essentially invisible to the eye. And I am, at the moment, surrounded safely by these amazing individuals that I deeply admire and that I can only look up to, because they are all brave enough to look with their eyes, to see with their hearts, and to act with their energy and power. My name is Jana, I was born in Bosnia. I am 30 years old and I am very grateful for the invitation to be part of this special event and share my experiences and thoughts. What I am about to share is like a short movie compared to numerous other stories of trafficking survivors. And each day I am extremely aware of how lucky I was because every other day spent in that horrible cage consumes another piece of you: your freedom, and your humanity, violently. My story happened in Ljubljana Slovenia, where I moved in September 2004. I moved there to continue my university studies. I was alone and distant from all my friends that I had, from the world that I knew. And then I quickly found myself surrounded with strangers. One of my new friends, a girl, she said her name was Romana, offered me to stay in her apartment, since at that moment I did not know where I am going to live. She was very kind to me and supportive so I entirely trusted her. I was looking for a part-time job to support myself during the school year. One day, in October 2004, she came home and told me that she had organised an interview for me at an accounting firm. After that, I never saw Romana again. The next morning, I went to an office where I sat down for an interview with a woman. The interview had lasted about ten minutes, when two men entered the room and dragged me away to a car. I was screaming and resisting. I was taken somewhere blindfolded and raped many times and beaten because I was resisting. I was drugged with heroin. All my things were taken and I was forced to wear sexually provocative clothes. I was forced to do prostitution in Ljubljana for about 4 months. I had 6-10 customers each day and night, and changed around 10 different locations in the period I was captured. Men who came to me were coming from all age groups, social standings, educational backgrounds, employed or unemployed. Often policemen, or criminals. I was starved sometimes, raped at first, later only beaten. I was driven from location to location blindfolded and naked. Only covered with a white sheet. I was repeatedly threatened in order to obey them, especially by the life and freedom of my little sister, and I was constantly reminded how easy it is for them to put her in my place. At the end of January 2005, I escaped my traffickers. I remembered that day was quiet and nobody was coming to my room for hours. The person who helped me with the escape was the same person that was selling my services and the services of the other girls. A woman that worked on the telephone; the same one that interviewed me the day that they captured me. She slid my passport under my door, and I knew that was my chance. That was my exit. Today we live in times where slavery is still all around us. As we move forwards, or strive to move forwards, in providing more freedom and equality, and basic human rights for all, we have on the other side this horrible fact. Do we really need millions more victims in order to experience a true wake-up call? I really wonder.  How many more 13-year old girls: your daughter, my sister, our children, need to be forced into prostitution? How many more need to choose it on their own, for those who create the demand, those who manage supply and those who drove profit out of their bodies and lives? When will we stop to maintain our economy, by enslaving and abusing the poor, the weak, the vulnerable?  How many more will be put into the number of some statistics; what number is high enough in this age of cruellest slavery? When will we all stand face to face with this issue? When will we really admit it? I hope we all know that ignorance and silence means engagement in the crime, nothing less. How can we prevent it? Only together and we are in this together. It is our responsibility, it is our personal business. These are our girls and boys, these are our children, our mothers and fathers, and this is our world. We should all start displaying serious understanding about, and clear attitude against trafficking and prostitution and their roots. They are completely interrelated and therefore we cannot treat them separately in any way. One encourages the other and one is part of the other. Remember that most of the girls who are presumably choosing to become a prostitute are underage girls: 13, 14 years old. That is human trafficking too. Governments, legal institutions, media, entertainment industry, army, medical and educational institutions, and all others that have powerful influence, need to display a clear and understandable attitude, views and laws about these issues. Educate, provide information, encourage action, discussion, and involvement, be it through trustworthy role models. Projects should be encouraged and financially supported especially those local community projects whose aim is to raise awareness, educate, and engage people in all fields. From the ground to the top, we need to create networks. From governments, educational, legal, social institutions, businesses, to schools, local communities, individuals. We have to involve all. Traffickers are extremely well-connected. We need to be too. We have to create safe spaces and support in all fields for victims and survivors. We need to develop victim-survivor centred intervention methods to help them. Each survivor is different. We need to design each intervention method specifically to meet her or his needs. Clearly and urgently the spotlight needs to be moved to the clients. The creators of demand. And to those who collect huge profits. We need to bring them out of the shadow. We need to hear their names. We need to see their faces and hear about their crimes. And they have to be held responsible for their actions. On the other hand, I believe that we should try and approach them, the clients and potential clients, educate them and raise their awareness. The actions against those involved in this criminal activity should be publicly announced and shared. People should be encouraged to report and give information, to be involved. And they should be clear about where to report it. Media should not ever scandalise survivors and their stories, but relate to empower them. Hear their stories and share their wisdom and strength with the public. In this way, let them use their incredible inner power to raise awareness. Involve those who wish to break the silence, and nurture those who need the silence. Educate, and be educated. At the end, let me just say that we all here refuse: we refuse human trafficking, we refuse prostitution, we refuse violence, enslavement, manipulation. We refuse it all. We still cry, but our tears are tears of power, and we will give all our best to make contributions in any way we can to end it all, and let us grow into something better.            ","Bosnian victims are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in construction and other sectors in countries across Europe including Croatia, France, Serbia, Slovenia, and Austria. Corruption creates an environment enabling some trafficking crimes. Thirty-year old Jana Kohut from Bosnia told the Human Rights Council how she was trafficked and sexually exploited for four months in neighbouring Slovenia. Jana was abducted and forced to work as a prostitute for four months before she managed to escape. In her testimony, she calls for the creation of safe places and support for victims and survivors of trafficking."
Jonas,2017 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Lithuania (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is Jonas. I am 46-years-old and come from a small town in Lithuania near the border with Poland. Work is hard to find in my country and it’s poorly paid when you get it. I was in debt because of a loan for medical bills for one of my children. So money was tight. One day I was approached by a man called Mindaugas, who said he could find me a job in the UK that would pay me more in a week than I could earn in Lithuania in a month. He made it all sound very good and said I could get a good life there. It was a hard decision to leave my home country and quite scary but I needed the money. I could not afford the fare but he told me that I could pay him back for the transport and accommodation once I started working. I had to trust him. Along with a number of other Lithuanians we drove to the UK in a van. It took more than two days. When we arrived we were met by a man called Marijus who took us to a house on the coast. It was very cramped with lots of people living there. They said they would find work for me and that I would have to open a bank account so that my wages could be paid into it. It took a while to get a job and they kept telling me to be patient. I had no food and my debts were piling up. After a few weeks they took me to a factory where they prepared chickens for the supermarkets. It wasn’t pleasant and it was repetitive but I was very relieved that I was finally working for decent money. In the first couple of weeks I was paid with cheques – not into my new bank account. I had to go to a shop where they cashed them for you. They charged commission, of course! Marijus had his men follow me and as soon as I got the money they would force me to hand it over to them. I was very frightened and feared that if I did not do as they said they would beat me up and take it anyway. I gave them all of my wages for the week – about £260. They took £220 and gave me £40 back ‘to live on’, they said. They told me I still owed about £1,000 for the transport to the UK and my accommodation and food so far, so I should get used to it. They were charging me about £60 per week for a bed in a shared room, sleeping on the floor with three others but they said if I did not live in the house they provided then I would not get work. I was trapped! After a few weeks I’d had enough. They were taking nearly everything I earned. I was working for nothing. This was not the life I had been told about. We talked in the house about what we could do. Two other men felt the same as I did and so we decided to risk it and run away. We found a different place to live but knew that we were always in danger as Marijus would come looking for us. He managed to contact me by phone. He threatened me so we went back to the chicken factory. He had contacts there and made sure we were put on a shift where his men could watch us. Then one day we were followed back to the flat. Marijus and his men forced their way in and threatened me. They started rifling through all my things and found what was left of the money I had brought with me from home. They took it and then found some cash withdrawal slips I had from a new bank account I had opened. They were furious and demanded my new bank card and passport. When I refused they beat me and knocked me unconscious. They searched the flat and found my bank card but I had hidden my passport in my pillow case. I told them I’d lost it. I didn’t want to give that up or there would be no chance of escape. Marijus yelled at me: “You came here not to earn and save but to manage and get through.” In other words, he was telling me I was nothing more than their slave and was brought to the UK to earn money for them and not for me. He said if I talked to anyone I would disappear and that if I tried to get back to Lithuania they would find my family and kill them. I guessed money was passing through the bank account they set up for me and suspected this had come from prostitution and drugs so I put a block on it. When they found out I received texts threatening my life. Then one day at the factory I was interviewed by a woman who said she was from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority – the GLA. She said they were trying to find out if workers at the factory were legitimate and being treated and paid properly. I didn’t tell her anything at the time because I didn’t know if I could trust her but later I called and told them everything. They told me about the National Referral Mechanism for trafficking victims. Then it dawned on me. I had no idea that’s what I was until it was explained to me. Me – a victim of human trafficking! They explained I’d been brought to the UK to be exploited. I was being forced to work. I had no control over my life. That’s what human trafficking is! Soon after, Marijus disappeared from the house but I lived in fear he would come back one day looking for me. The NRM moved me to the north west of England – safe from the eyes and the threats and the fists of Marijus. I stayed there for a couple of months and thought about getting another job – one where I would be paid properly and earn the kind of money I had been promised at the start. But I wanted out. I’d had enough. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be safe. I hope Marijus and his gang will be found and pay for what they did. They are not humans. I wanted to leave this world for a time and I never want to feel that way again.","According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, there are more than 11,000 slaves living in Lithuania. Observers estimate 40 percent of identified Lithuanian victims of modern slavery are women and girls subjected to sexual exploitation within the country. Lithuanian women are also subjected to sex trafficking in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Lithuanian children and adults are increasingly forced to engage in criminal activities, such as shoplifting and drug selling, in Nordic countries and Western Europe. Lithuanian men are subjected to forced labor, including in agriculture, in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Jonas was one of these men who left in the hope of well-paid work but found instead a situation of exploitation and violence. He was able to leave the situation due to work carried out by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority."
Josefa,2013 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Peru (trafficked from),Peru (slave location),"My name is Josefa Condori. As a child, I was a domestic worker. When I was a child, in the community where I lived, there weren't educational opportunities, nor access to hospitals, or other things needed in the life of a girl.  When I visit a rural community far away from Cuzco, I often feel that I am reliving my own experience. Conditions aren't as they should be. Conditions are different in other parts of the world. The day I left my community, it was a day full of sun. You could say that I was full delusions. There was the emotion of leaving, but also the emotion of leaving my family and my commmunity. It was sad but also exciting. I had heard wonderful things about the city - that I would get educated, I would live better, I would have shoes - we didn't have shoes. My mother told me ""you have to go"" because my father had died and she couldn't support us. There were three of us. I was 9 years old, and she couldn't support us. A girl domestic worker in a house must wash dishes, wash the clothes, or take care of another child when she is a child herself. If the girl is hit or falls, you also get hurt. It was not the Lima I had dreamed about. I felt asphyxiated there. I was wondering why I couldn't go to school because the children of the family I worked for went to school. I saw that they left and they had their lunchboxes, but not me. So I said, ""I want to go to school."" The years went by and at the age of 16, I met an association of domestic workers that supported young girls, and they told me to come, so I went. In the Yanapanakusun shelter when a girl or an adolescent enters, we try to give them comprehensive care - tools for their life - so that they can standup for themselves. I would say that it isn't always about changing their work, but if they want to change that is fine. I hope that someday, domestic work is like any other job, but it should be work that is respected, valued, and paid fairly. The older youth are being trained as kitchen helpers, to make drinks, housekeeping. Because many also want to be nurses, teachers -  the girls have dreams. We help them group their dreams - first I can do this, and then I can dream something else. Something technical for the medium term, that I can start doing quickly, and then continue dreaming.","Josefa Condori Quispe left her small village in Peru at age 9 to work as a maid in Lima. After spending much of her life as a house slave, she managed to get an education and escape domestic servitude. She founded Yanapanakusun to fight the root causes of slavery, and she runs a shelter for young slavery survivors."
Jovie,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Jovie and I grew up in a mountainous area of the Philippines with very few neighbours. I am the only girl in my family and I was adopted. I have three brothers in my adoptive family and they were very abusive towards me. When I was young I can remember that sometimes my brother would spank me and then I was not very happy, especially when my adoptive mother transferred out of the house for work. When I first learned that I was adopted I was very sad and I realised why I was not close with my brothers. I asked myself, “Why did my real mother give me to another person?” I thought that maybe there were plenty of brothers and sisters and there was no money to buy milk for all of us and that is why I was placed in a banana plantation for other people to find me. My adoptive father worked in the sugar cane industry and this provided for our food and some education. I only attended school until the end of elementary. My father and I and my three brothers mostly lived together as my mother was relocated due to her work. When I would return home from school there was only my brothers and me and they would get mad at me and beat me up. So I used to run away and my father would come looking for me and bring me home. I can remember an event at night when I was a child. I was home alone with my brother, who tended to be mentally challenged, maybe because of drugs. This night he came into the room I was sleeping in and he turned off the kerosene lamp and then he tried to rape me. I was shocked and fearful and eventually I told my adoptive parents and my cousin and they explained that he is mentally challenged. From then on I did not want to be close to him and I always locked my room and I was so fearful. Many times I saw him peeping at me. Another time when I ran away because of my brothers I went to a beach area and there was a man there who stalked me and touched my body. I found a place where there were plenty of people but I was still fearful. At 12 years old I started drinking alcohol. My friends and I mixed Coke and other soft drinks and gin. Once I ran away and got drunk and nearly drowned. It was good that my mother found me. I was punished badly for that. My older brother slapped me so hard I had a nose bleed. After that time I found a boyfriend and we always drank and had sex. When I was 16 I ran away from home. I went to a small hut along the sea shore and I didn’t know that there were gangs of young boys. There were two gangs of boys and one of them came to the hut where I stayed, and I was nearly raped by them. But the other gang helped me so that I was not raped. When I was 17 I ran away to Cebu City where I just wandered around the streets. A woman told me that I couldn’t stay in one place like a bystander because there were plenty of people with bad intentions who would take advantage of me. Later that woman told me that if I really wanted to work she could take me to Kamagayan [the red light district of Cebu City]. She found me a customer and we were accommodated in one of the hotels there. It was the first time I had been with a customer and I was very apprehensive and of course I didn’t like it but I just gave in. In Kamagayan I was given a pimp. I didn’t like the place at first as I was not very accustomed to it but later, as days passed, I started to like the place. I really thought I liked Kamagayan. I had nowhere to go, no one to feed me, no one to give me money – it’s for those reasons that I liked Kamagayan. The arrangement with the one who recruited me was that if I had a customer, my share would be 50 per cent. The procedure was that the customer would pay the manager and the manager would give me 50 per cent. I lived in the manager’s house and I was given food. Within a month of living there I started to use shabu [methamphetamine] because some relatives of the manager showed me how to use it. They told me that the customers preferred women who knew how to use shabu and who drank alcohol and they told me that I would not be shy anymore. My attitude was that I was there already and I had to accept it, whatever happened to me with the boys or with drugs. I considered myself strong. I didn’t have any relatives there and so I had to be strong to face the problems because it was my work and I could not work in settings other than in Kamagayan. I just had to cling to the day-to-day reality. I was in Kamagayan for three months and then I was recruited to go to Manila. I was really forced to go to Manila because I didn’t want the friends of my older brother to see me and I didn’t want my family to know that I was in Kamagayan. So I took the chance to go to Manila and I worked in a bar. I had a couple as my managers, whom I lived with. At night time, I would go into the bar and dress up. Sometimes I danced and sometimes I would just entertain customers. I was paid each Sunday, 50 per cent was for me and 50 per cent was for my managers. From my 50 per cent, they deducted money for my food, my dresses and my cosmetics. Most of the time this left me in debt to my managers. In the house we were living in there was always a guard who kept watch over us. There was an instance where one of the women there eloped with a boyfriend; that made our manager even stricter. We were forced to take our meals up inside the house and we could not go outside. The only time the house was opened was at 6pm to allow us to enter the bar, otherwise it was always locked. After five months in the bar, a friend and I escaped. We tricked our guard, pretending that we were going to buy juice. Instead we rode on a tricycle and then transferred into a jeepney [a common form of public transport] until we came to another place in Manila. We pawned a necklace for PHP2000, rented a house and then continued to take customers. We did not have bosses there. We had money but we just spent it on drugs and alcohol. Then we had boyfriends who became our live-in partners. I think trafficking happens because of the many problems that the women have, family problems that mean they do not want to go home so they just decide to stay there like I did. I think one of the factors that contributed to my being trafficked was that I was not very close to my family and also those things that happened to me like nearly being raped and having sex with others. I don’t think I will go back to my hometown because of the many problems with my family. I can’t be at peace with my brother and my father has died and my mother is so sick. So, I think I will just stay here in Cebu forever. In the future I can see myself having a partner, a man who can accept my past, and I will not be engaged in prostitution. I will stop. I plan to stop when I can find a man who loves me and accepts me but right now, I don’t have any plan. I am not very confident yet to recover. I don’t know what causes me to go out but I do know that every time I have a problem I run away. So when I have conflicts inside, I go out just as I did when I was very young. Every time I have a problem I run away. I am looking for peace. I want a family who can care for me, and I can care for; a small family. If I can establish a family of my own I will be happy. If I had the opportunity, I would tell those women and girls who have not been in this situation, please refrain from being trafficked because it’s not good to be in this situation. If you are prostituted you will drink alcohol and use drugs and it’s very hard to get out. To be trafficked is a very difficult situation. I would also like to tell the people, the general public, that they should not go to Kamagayan, especially the males. That way there would be no demand. Parents should guide their children so that these children will not go to Kamagayan. Right now, I cannot understand my life. I want to surrender, I want to stop. These days I go out Friday, Saturday and Sunday and make money, but the money I get is spent on drugs and alcohol, so I really don’t have money. I want to change, maybe there are things that I cannot change, but I really want to change my life. I need to have a family, a peaceful family, and to find meaning in my life.","In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism. Rising internet usage rates, the availability of mobile phones and poverty has fostered online child sexual exploitation. 
Jovie managed to escape her situation of sex slavery, but remained in prostitution making her own money. She explains that she wants to leave sex work altogether but, because of an addiction to the drugs that she was encouraged to use when she was enslaved, “it’s very hard to get out.”"
K,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Germany (trafficked from),Germany (slavery location),"It all began in the early morning hours of 9 April 2011. My pimp had once again beaten and strangled me so badly that I was afraid I would die. I managed to escape through the brothel window and dialed the emergency number. At that time I had no idea what the consequences of that call would be. I’d known my pimp since I was 11 years old. He was my 46-year-old riding instructor and he made me into his “mistress” when I was 14 years old. I dreamt of living together with this man who was 35 years older than me. He told me we would have our own horse ranch—a childhood dream of mine. He told me that in order to achieve our dream of a future together, we would need money, and the quickest way to get this money was for me to—just temporarily, of course—work as a prostitute. Over time, he managed to completely isolate me from my friends and family, and started “training” me to be a prostitute by showing me how to perform various sex acts and by taking me on visits to brothels. Soon my “loving and fatherly” riding teacher increasingly revealed himself to be a “Loverboy” (a man who pretends to be a woman or girl’s boyfriend in order to lure her into prostitution). In 2000, when I was 17, I ran away from home with him and he put me in a brothel. His earlier promises of love and a future together were now followed by beatings, rapes and humiliation. There was no way back for me. He was the only person I had in this world and I didn’t want to lose him. After all, I loved him. Back to what happened in 2011: As a result of my help-call, the police came to the brothel, followed by an ambulance which took me to the emergency room. The criminal investigation police were also informed. They interrogated me several times and examined my injuries. I was deliberately kept away from the brothel and my pimp so that I wouldn’t back out of the investigation. At that time I didn’t even realize what was going on; I was a complete wreck, physically and emotionally. The following weeks were hell for me and my relatives. I was interrogated by the criminal police for about 70 hours, with old wounds being reopened each time. Court proceedings followed. I impressed everyone with my personality, my intelligence and my good memory, so much so that the prosecution fully rested on my statements and credibility. During the trial, I was questioned for almost 20 hours over six days. The public was very interested in the case, and TV and radio stations as well as newspapers were constantly reporting on it. I can’t express in words how it felt to have to testify in court over and over again. I was sitting there in the large chamber and had to reveal the most intimate details of my life. I had to describe in precise detail all the rapes, beatings and acts of degradation I suffered. I became completely and utterly exhausted. I lost 17 kg (around 37 pounds) and repeatedly had to get medical treatment. If I hadn’t had such a strong support system, I probably would not have survived that time period. But the result was really impressive! In December 2011 my pimp was sentenced to nine years in prison and just barely avoided getting locked up for the rest of his life. But what really caused a stir was that the court ruled that I should receive €1,000,000 (around $1,350,000 USD) compensation for the earnings that my pimp took from me over the years. Some people now believe I am a millionaire, but that’s not the case. I will not see one cent of that million. After the verdict, everyone considered the case to be closed and for things to be over and done with. But for me it wasn’t over, and it still isn’t to this day. I fell into deep depression, sadness and loneliness. My family was continuously looking for therapy for me, but in vain. I have been involved in drawn-out disputes with the owner of the last brothel, the tax authority and even a former client. The owner of the brothel threatened to claim compensation from me because the brothel had been closed but my contract with the owner—signed on my behalf by my pimp—was valid until 2015. Although I was able to negotiate down the sum, which was originally much higher, I still had to pay €5,000 to the tax authority for the profits generated for the brothel by the other women during my absence, since I was legally the manager (according to the contract signed by my pimp on my behalf), even though it was proven in the criminal court case against my pimp that I had been trafficked and exploited in that same brothel during that time. I have also been the defendant in a civil case in which a client is demanding repayment of €50,000, even though it was proven during the criminal trial that this attempt to buy me was against my will and that my pimp got the money. I find it unbelievable that, according to our laws, I am required to pay back that money just because it passed through my hands. Today, when I look back on what has happened since I made that emergency call, I have to ask myself: where is the justice in our legal system? Without the unbelievable support of my family and of friends, I wouldn’t have been able to get through all of this. If my family hadn’t paid for everything, I would be financially ruined. What other victim has such a strong support system and such financial resources? My guess is none! Should our government order law enforcement to first check the financial capabilities of a victim before they offer help? Seems so! But that would mean that in the future only those victims would get help who can afford freedom—sad but true!  ","When K.’s pimp took her for the first time to “work” in a brothel in Bremen, K. began crying and refused to cooperate, and he took her back to their hometown in Bavaria. However, after continued abuse paired with affection, he soon succeeded in prostituting K. in apartments and various legal brothels throughout Germany. During her time in prostitution, spanning over 10 years, K. rarely had days off, sometimes had 20-40 buyers a day, and lived inside the brothels and apartments. Her pimp took all of her money, and repeatedly raped and beat her inside the brothels. When K. was 20, her pimp pressured her to get breast implants. Though K.’s pimp had previously been convicted of pimping in 1970 and had a long criminal record for other crimes including fraud and bodily harm, he was able to become the manager of a legal brothel in 2001, and to get K. “employed” in various legal brothels throughout the country—in at least two of these brothels while she was still a minor. He also signed a contract on her behalf making her a manager of one of the brothels, during which time K. continued to be prostituted in the very same brothel, with her pimp taking all of her earnings."
Kamala,2015 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was tricked. I was trafficked by my own aunt so you don't really know who you can trust. They'd chew meat and spit it on my face. They would throw a plate full of rice on me. They would beat me up. They'd make me work from 5 a.m. to later than 1 a.m. the next day. And they didn't pay me. A Shakti employee helped me get on a train from Bombay to Lucknow, India, where my husband picked me up. Since then, I got involved with Shakti. I go to meetings whenever I can. The women at Shakti understand my situation. Shakti gives me loans with no interest and I use that money. I go around villages telling people to not get tricked into human trafficking. Members are given posters with illustrations to distribute. I hang them outside shops and public places.","In Nepal, poverty forces people to seek work overseas to provide for themselves and their desperate families. Migration across the border is unsafe and uncontrolled, which is how Kamala was trafficked and forced into slavery. It is estimated that there are over four million domestic workers in India. The domestic sector is informal and unregulated, obscured in private homes, and workers are not recognised as such but rather as ‘informal help’. Their wages are, on average, only a third of those in other sectors, they have very limited social protections, and commonly suffer poor working conditions, exploitation, abuse and slavery. Many domestic workers are migrants from poorer states and are among the most marginalised and socially discriminated populations in India."
Kanthi,2012 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Sri Lanka (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I think, from my experience, the most important thing is shelter, and counselling, and the security. And it's important to have like CAST [Coalition To Abolish Slavery]'s shelter because they know how to talk and how to make me comfortable so that's the important one, and also the security because I don't know, like, if something could happen to me or my family, so it's very important to explain about the security that what kind of security I have, because for two years I couldn't trust anybody. I didn't know that, like, I can be safe here. I'm from Sri Lanka and from where I came from, the people, the government or the police they, they will believe the people who have money they are, like, if I am there I have no right, so I was new to the United States and I didn't know that I have rights so it's very important like explain about the security and that we have a right. And also the counselling, for when I came to United States I was trusting these people and they was always like very often told me that I have no right, I have no money, I have no power, I'm nothing. So it's very important to have a counselling to make, like, it helped me to make me comfortable and to, like, again, I could trust somebody I can talk to somebody that somebody's there for me to live you know when I want to cry, I want to talk, there is somebody to, you know, listen and so it's very important to have those three: shelter, security, and the counselling. For me, and I think also if everybody else I was afraid if they are the only one I know if I - they always told me that if I talk to anybody or I tell anybody I will be punished, and they know that they are my family live and that the my trafficker told me that they know where I live in my country and where is my family they have pictures of my family, that they will punish my family, and they told me that they know some people who is in Sri Lanka working for the government that if I go back, or I say something they can bring me back and hurt my family, I was afraid of that. Then also that I have nobody to talk I, you know, like, I cannot answer the phone, I cannot go out, and I don't know anybody, so it was difficult for me to like after I came out to even to trust somebody. And, you know, because that I was also praying for myself and also for my family. After I came here everything changed that I didn't get paid for 26 months and I was not able to help my family. I came here help my family and they was holding my passport, so it's very important for me that if I - before I came here, I didn't know, like, if something can happen to me and if I can call somebody. I didn't really know what is the 911, so it's very important people who come here, or different country, that they before they come they have some kind of information that they can call or they can go and ask for help.","There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). The US attracts migrants and refugees who are particularly at risk of vulnerability to human trafficking. Trafficking victims often responding to fraudulent offers of employment in the US migrate willingly and are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in industries such as forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation.Kanthi spent more than two years in domestic servitude in US after being trafficked from her home in Sri Lanka under false pretenses. This narrative is taken from an interview by Julie Fernandes as part of a webcast by Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking (ATEST). Kanthi discusses what the most important services are for those coming out of slavery, and the barriers that people must overcome in order to remove themselves from situations of slavery."
Kavya,2015 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I am doing this business since 6 years. My father used to drink a lot and was drunk all the time and used to beat me and my mother and brother. My mother used to work at other houses and the money she earned he spent it all in his drinks. If he was denied the money, he would beat us all. Because of the family being big there was always a shortage of food in the house. I also started going for work at some places. I met Varun. He told me to come along to get him some work. So I went with him. He forced me into things and finally left me to a contractor for work. The contractor lived with his wife and kids. I started working there. One day the contractor’s wife went with her children for a wedding. Getting an opportunity and seeing me alone he forced me into things. He even called his friends and all of them drank and forced themselves on me. When I said I will complain in my locality he said he will throw acid on me if I do that. He also threatened to kill my brothers. He also said he would not pay me for any work and would take me out from my house and would not give me any work. She started crying saying this. I was scared and I had to accept his whims and fancies and agree to all his demands.  When my landlady returned he told me to go away and said I am not needed there now. He told me stay anywhere else now, rented a flat for me and made me stay there and do business. When I objected he threatened me and even beat me. I couldn’t tell this at home also. My father was drunkard and I did not want to bother my mother for this. She was anyways worried about my father’s poverty. I kept suffering the tyranny by him all the time. One day my father asked me for money and when I refused he beat me and my mother. He drunk heavily that day and returned home that night and tore my clothes which I wore. He even raped me then. When this happened with me and I saw my mother seeing me desperately not able to do anything I was devastated. After this I contemplated suicide cause I could not withstand things anymore. But then I saw my mother alone and brothers and felt pity on them. I thought what else is remaining with me as all my respect is gone so I finally moved into this business without any expectations. I made my brothers study so that their lives are not made hell like mine. I want them to become good human beings and lead a good comfortable life.","Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages in India or Gulf States and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Kavya was sexually exploited after leaving home to find money to help out her large family. Rather than seeking to escape sex work, she talks of helping her brothers to get an education."
Kikka,2010 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Venezuela (trafficked from) ,United States (slavery location),"My name is Kikka Cerpa. I was born and grew up in Venezuela. I met a man named Daniel in Caracas, Venezuela, when I was working in a hotel. Daniel was very kind to me, I fall in love with him. I was only 17. After a few years, Daniel moved to New York and wanted me to join him. I didn’t know that Daniel’s family ran a sex trafficking business, bringing girls from Venezuela into the United States for sexual exploitation. When I arrived in New York City, Daniel and his cousin Sandra kept me in a basement. They took my passport and my money. They told me that I owed them a lot of money, the amount kept growing. They told me that the only way I could pay it off was working in a brothel that Sandra ran. The first night was the worst. I had to serve 19 men, they line up for a new girl. I was trafficked over the next three years. My exploiter moved me from one place to another. One time I told Daniel that I was going to go to the police. He told me that if I did, that I would be arrested and deported. Sometimes the police would raid the brothel. Instead of rescuing us, they demand that we perform sexual services on them. The other girls and I were arrested over and over for prostitution. Never did the police or the prosecutors ask us if we were trafficked. My best friend in the brothel was Annie, a girl trafficked by her family from the Dominican Republic. Annie was murdered in front of me by a customer. He was angry because she refused to have sex with him. I picked Annie’s killer out of a line-up, and I testify against him in court. After Annie was killed, I knew I needed to escape my traffickers. My way out was by marrying a customer. When I was seven months pregnant with my second daughter, he began to beat me. Like Daniel, he threatened to have me deported. He threatened to tell immigration that I was a criminal. He said, “who’s going to believe a whore?” I finally escaped with my daughters to a shelter for battered women. When I went to court for an order of protection I met Sanctuary for Family. Sanctuary for Family help me with a safe place to live, financial assistance and counselling. They helped me gain court-ordered protection, custody of my girls and an award from my abuser. They got my criminal conviction vacated and helped me get legal immigration status.  Like all the survivors here today, I am telling my story to help trafficking victims around the world. We need to pass and enforce laws that will protect us from trafficker like Daniel and Sandra. The customers should be held accountable. They should be treated like the criminals they are. They need to train the police officers and prosecutors so they can identify and protect victims. We need to provide victims with service, like the one that I received from Sanctuary for Families.  ","In 2015, the most reported venues or industries for sex trafficking in the United States included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motels, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sexual exploitation. Kikka was lured to the United States and forced into sex work by a man she had thought was her long-term boyfriend. Her story highlights reasons that those trapped in sex slavery can feel unable to report their treatment to the police. She also describes how support from charities and NGOs can make recovery and building a new life easier."
Kolab,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",Cambodia (slavery location),"I was born in 1991. My parents treated me like a house servant and frequently beat me for no reason. Since they were farmers, I had to help them in the rice paddies after finishing the housework. When I turned 7, I learned that my “parents” were actually foster parents. They told me that my biological parents had sold me shortly after I was born for the equivalent of 1,000 U.S. dollars since they could not afford to raise me, which was very hurtful. When I turned 13 years old, my foster parents sent me to a woman in the capital city, Phnom Penh. I worked for this woman and her family every day for the equivalent of $12.50 U.S. a month. The woman forced me to clean, cook, and wash non-stop. I had no time to rest, not even on the weekends. One day, two months after I arrived, the woman went out and I stayed home babysitting her children. Her husband called me into his room and tried to have sex with me. I started yelling, but he raped me anyway. To escape the home where I was basically a servant, I went to Phnom Penh province where a friend told me I could find work. When I arrived, I didn’t know where to go. I was standing by the taxis when two men asked me where I was going. I told them I didn’t know. They said that if I didn’t have any relatives, I could stay with them. I had few choices and, since they were older, I assumed they were safe to live with so I agreed. When we arrived to their home, I saw 2 men and 15 girls who were strung out on drugs. I felt afraid, but the man told me everything would be alright. He introduced me to a man called Tiger II who I later learned owned the place and was the leader of a gang. After a week, Tiger II ordered me to have sex with a man on video but I refused. He said: “You cannot refuse. You must do this for me.” He ordered someone to inject me with drugs. Then I could no longer refuse because I had no control. I had to do what they wanted which was to be filmed having sex with Khmer men, Vietnamese men and Japanese men. During this time, I also had to have sex with Tiger II and members of his gang. This torture continued for 20 days and they subdued me with drugs. I was hopeless and thought: The world is so big with many girls and women, why has this problem happened to me?  Tiger II ordered me to sell drugs from 9:00pm to 11:00pm and then sell my body from 11:00pm to 4:00am. I was ordered to steal, pickpocket, and cheat my customers by taking their money and motorbikes. They expected me to make $200 to $300 per night; if I did not, they punished me by stripping and beating me with a stick until I fainted, electrocuting me, cutting me and pouring salt water on the cuts, and placing my hands into a bamboo press for up to 20 minutes. I received these punishments several times and still have the scars. To numb the pain, I began taking more drugs, like yama and acetima-mint, which made me feel invincible and unafraid. Tiger II and his gang watched me carefully and punished me for anything I did wrong. They forced me to sleep with as many as 50 customers a day. I had to give Tiger II all my money, but I secretly hid $5 from each customer. Most of the customers thought I was dirty. If I tried to confide in them about Tiger II, they accused me of lying.  I worked for Tiger II in both Phnom Penh and Kampong Cham for almost 2 years. Eventually I gained their trust, and they watched me less carefully. One night, I took the money I had saved and stole an additional $500 from the boss in order to run away with a friend. We went to Phnom Penh and sold vegetables, but the gang found me and forced me to return to the brothel. I was forced to make more sex videos, and again, I ran away. I tried to find work in a factory, but nobody would hire me so I started working at the Hing Hing Massage Parlor. One day, in December 2009, the police arrived and closed down the parlor. I was very scared that I would be arrested, but they told me they wanted to help me. The police sent me to the Accommodation of Social Affairs department so I could learn some skills and get a proper job. After meeting the non-profit organization AFESIP Cambodia there, I finally was able to leave the sex industry, where I never wanted to be in the first place. I have decided to study hairdressing in the AFESIP center to make a living. I’d like to become a good hairdresser or a staff member of AFESIP, so I can help other victims.","Kolab does not know who her real parents are. She studied to grade 5, then was forced to worked as a family servant, in a karaoke bar, and to sell drugs and sex. After eventually escaping successfully she tried to find work outside of the sex industry but could find no work, and so began work in a massage parlor brothel. Later she was able to leave the industry with the help of an NGO named AFESIP Cambodia. Names have been changed to protect the survivors' privacy."
Kumar,2010 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Nepal (trafficked from),Iraq (slavery location),"I am Kumar Ramjali from Nepal. I am thankful to the organisers, who gave me this opportunity to be here today. I have a family, with a wife and 2 children and I come from Patlekhet village, of rural Myagdi district of Nepal. I worked on my parents’ farm, and did not have another job. I am a victim of human trafficking in Iraq and a survivor from the incident in which 12 innocent Nepalese were beheaded and shot in Iraq. Due to my poverty in Nepal, and the attractive wage paid abroad, I was eager to work overseas. I met an agent from an employment company, “Manpower,” in Kathmandu. I was told that I would get 1,200 USD per month for working in a company in America. I paid 100,000 NPRs, approximately 1,300 USDs, to Manpower. That is roughly equivalent to about one year’s salary in Nepal. The agents sent me to Delhi, where I had to pay another 100,000 NPRs, which I managed to do by taking loans. I stayed in Delhi for 19 days, where I had a very miserable time without work or enough food to eat. My passport was taken by the agent. In August 2004, I was taken to Jordan, where I met other men from Nepal. Some of us were told that we would work in America, others were told they would work in hotels in Jordan. But the agent told us “no” – we were instead going to work in an American camp in Iraq. We did not want to go and we argued with the agent, but we did not have our passports, our families had gone deep into debt, we did not have any money and did not know anyone in Jordan. We were trapped. One night at midnight we were loaded into cars and driven miles across the long desert. We were told to crouch down on the floor with our heads below the windows. We were told we would have a United Nations escort at the border, but that was a lie. We could see men with guns outside and we were very scared. We didn’t know what was happening, and none of us could communicate with the driver. In Baghdad we were held in a locked room with no electricity. The Iraqi agent only unlocked the door to throw food inside. We were held for 8 days in that horrible place. We learned that 2 of the vans that were in our caravan were carrying 12 Nepalese who were missing. We later learned that they had been stopped by insurgents, and that the 12 men were kidnapped and murdered, their executions broadcast on the internet. That bad news scared us that anything could happen to us at any time. Finally, we were flown to the Al Assad B1 airbase. I was put to work right away in the laundry. I worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. I was paid 290 USD a month, which was much less than I had been promised. 10 of us slept in bunks crowded into small containers. It was very crowded and hot. The companies I worked for were US military contractors and partners, a Jordanian company and KBR, an American company. I was supervised by men from Dowd and Partners, and they were supervised by men from KBR. I worked in the laundry for two months, then I was transferred to the fuel pump, where I worked for 18 months. I spent a total of 4 years at the base. The last years I worked in garbage collection. I eventually got a raise to 580 USD per month, but I always worked 12 hour days, 7 days a week and I slept in the same container. I did not want to stay but had no option to leave. Outside the camp was miles of desert and it was dangerous. Even in the camp there were mortar fire and bombings. I could hear, and see, the bomb explosions near the fuel pump. I had to work very hard and continuously, with my eyes open all the time. I didn’t have a single moment when I could breathe easily. I got nightmares every time I slept. I asked over and over to go home. One day my passport was returned to me and I was put on a flight back home.  I hope that my statement can help the families of the 12 Nepalese who were killed. The families filed a lawsuit in the United States against Dowd and KBR. I also hope that you will listen to our voices and take steps to stop others from suffering as we have done.","Men and women from throughout Asia and East Africa who migrate to Iraq are subjected to forced labor as construction workers, security guards, cleaners, handymen, and domestic workers. Some foreign migrants are recruited for work in other countries in the region but are forced, coerced, or deceived into working in Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. In January 2016, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs reported approximately 140,000 foreign workers lacked formal work permits. Kumar, a father of two, left his home village in Nepal for Jordan after promises of a well-paid job abroad. Kumar told the UN Human Rights Council that he nearly died as he together with 12 others were transported through two countries in a convey of vans to a military base in Iraq."
Kyi,2013 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Myanmar (trafficked from),Thailand (slavery location),"It happened soon after I arrived in Thailand. Since I refused to work on the fishing boat, I was beaten up very badly. The agent Ko Myo attacked me using a knife. My right hand was cut and the wound was pretty bad. It happened in a room near the pier. I had been kept in this room for 7 months before I was placed on the boat. The first ever murder that took place right before my eyes was when my friend was killed by Ko Myo and his thugs. Although he was referred to as my friend, I did not know his name. He was among a group when I came to Thailand. When I was left in the room because of the knife injury, he was sent to the boat. Similarly, he tried to run away but failed and was sent back to the room. Ko Myo and his thugs beat him to death using wooden rods. I also saw that they killed three men at the same time in the room. They were accused of conspiring to flee. They were taken into the room and beaten. Then they were executed by Ko Myo. Ko Myo shot them using his gun. There were the letters ‘USA’ on his gun. He used lead balls as the bullets. They were shot in their foreheads by Ko Myo. At first, Ko Myo asked Charlie to kill them but Charlie showed hesitation. Then Ko Myo said, ‘I will show you how to kill’ and he shot them.","In March 2013, 14 victims aged between 16 and 46 years, and all from Myanmar, were rescued by local police from a fishing port and processing factory in Kantang where they were being held by brokers. Most of the victims had just returned from six months at sea, on three separate fishing vessels. Despite receiving no pay, by selling dried squid to the boat they transferred fish to, one of the group was able to save enough money to buy a mobile phone and SIM card. This enabled them to alert one of the other victim’s family members, who contacted a helpline for reporting human trafficking to secure their rescue. The Environmental Justice Foundation interviewed six victims, none of whom had ever been on a fishing boat, or even seen the sea before being trafficked. They gave accounts of being deceived by brokers who told them they would be working in factories. They reported being beaten or seeing others beaten, and working in arduous conditions onboard the fishing vessels. Three of the victims had been trafficked from within Thailand, whilst working in a chicken factory in the north of the country. A visiting broker had told them that he would secure them a better job in another factory, with higher wages.

While laws, systems and attitudes regarding key 'fault lines' such as the caste system, gender and feudalism are rapidly changing, social change of this depth and scale necessarily takes time. In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that existing research suggests that all forms of modern slavery continue to exist in India, including intergenerational bonded labour, forced child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced recruitment into nonstate armed groups and forced marriage.

With her mother’s help Sheikh contacted the authorities who prevented the marriage and put her in KGBV, however her mother received beatings from the whole family for helping stop the marriage."
HA,"",Sexual exploitation,"",Israel (slavery location),"We had a baby this year, he’s now seven months old. I didn’t work, I just took care of the baby. My husband would bring us food once a week. When he stopped coming, I didn’t have anything to eat. My milk for nursing had dried up and my baby was hungry. I was in despair. My sister told me that there are people who arrange cleaning work and that I would earn $1000 a month. I thought that with a salary like that, within six months I’d be set for a few years. If I had known that I was to be sold into prostitution in Israel, I would have preferred to die of starvation with my baby.

Abirami,2002 (Narrative date) ,War slavery Domestic slavery,Sri Lanka (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,Sri Lanka (slavery location),"I was born in a village. I grew up with a relative. I was told that my mother died and sometimes they said she had left me and run away. I don’t know anything about my mother. I have seen a photograph of my father. But I have never met him. They say that he lives in the city. I don’t know anything about him. When my relative died I was brought to another relative’s house. The wife is a very cruel woman. I went to a school close by, when I was about five or six years old. The wife never liked to send me to school. My relative insisted that I go to school and I went to school with their children. I studied hard and I have got prizes, I wanted to show the wife that I too can study. School starts at 8.30 in the morning and is over at 1.30 in the afternoon with a half an hour break at 10.30. The master who taught maths used to hit me. I was weak in that subject. The wife used to give me stale food, kept overnight like old rice and curry, whereas her children used to be given pittu and string hoppers freshly made for them. I suffered and suffered in her hands. She was very very wicked. I was often pinched and pushed and beaten up. She used anything at hand to hit me, even a broomstick. I have got hit till I got swollen all over the body. If in the kitchen she uses the ladle. When I was older the wife kept me home and didn’t allow me to go to school. I did all the work at home from cooking to cleaning, washing and everything I could possible do and what I could not do was forced on me. I suffered. I was angry with my mother and my father. I didn’t ask details about my parents – I haven’t seen my mother even in a photograph. When her children are treated differently and favored I get very hurt. I feel the wife doesn’t belong to our caste. I hear husband and wife fighting, where the caste is mentioned. My relative drinks — when he comes home drunk, wife used to hit him. One day I remember he came home drunk and asked for food. Wife refused to give food and this time he hit her very badly. Later he said sorry but she was angry for a long time. She gets angry when he comes drunk. My relative never hits me. Wife hits me with the ladle or anything she can lay hands on. Nobody wants me. I like Christmas and the New Year. All festivals make me sad. Especially when people take family photographs I feel sad and want to cry. Sometimes I cry. It is then I miss my own parents. When I was 13 years old I wanted to run away from cruel people who kept me. I started thinking — if I join the movement I’ll have a place and I can also do something useful. I joined the movement. I was contemplating on this for about one month. There were brothers and sisters who did lot of propaganda to make young people to join the movement. Looking at those sisters they were very smart, they wore uniforms and carried guns that I thought would make people respect me also. They also said we should save our land. I thought that was better than being badly treated by my aunt. My relative was wicked to me all the time, ill-treating me. I got an urge to join the movement. I told her I was leaving; she didn’t even bother to stop me. In fact she ignored me when I got ready and was watching me leave home. They took me to a jungle where there was a camp. I was given food. There were small sheds built and I slept on the ground. I was given an empty sack to sleep on. There were no pillows. I used to keep my clothes bag for my head. I continued to sleep that way. At times I have felt that I shouldn’t have left home. At least there I had a place to sleep on.  In the morning the sisters showed me the place where they go for the morning ablutions. When I washed and got ready they first of all introduced me on how to escape the army if they happen to meet or invade. They also said that the army is bad if they catch you they will abuse you, if they see you they will kill you. We have to kill them. If we fail in this duty we will get hit, disabled or we’ll die. I was placed in the ladies group. We had a leader and I was trained in this group. I was trained in the jungle on how to enter the enemy territory and collect information, the use of guns, grenades, compasses and spotting distances for shelling and writing detailed reports. I was harassed to write so many things in detail I did not like that as that was difficult and I did not like shooting and killing after I saw what was happening. Outwardly I behaved brave; inwardly I was scared. Apart from the difficult training I had to walk a long distance without food to places where the army camps were. We were so close that we could even hear them. Once I was in the midst of fierce fighting. As we were fighting there was lot of shooting and we were losing and finally we knew that the army had surrounded us. This attack came upon us in an unexpected manner. The army had been fully prepared. They very slowly came towards us may be at about four a.m. I think they thought we were dead — they had very big guns. They called out. I did not understand the language. They shouted at us and asked us to drop our arms. One leader who didn’t have the cyanide bit a capsule already bitten by another and that bit of cyanide got mixed with the blood and she died. I still get frightened of that sight. It is as though they suffer from fits. I saw convulsive jerky movements and a frightful death. I could not bear it and then I decided that I would not bite the cyanide capsule at all. One leader was also a doctor, she was wounded and she fell. At that terrible moment — she wanted to live prayed and cried to the Gods and told me to pray to Jesus. I prayed and asked God to save us. She ordered us to take the cyanide, I didn’t. The thought of the others — the way they died flashed before my eyes and I didn’t want to take cyanide. She stared at me and shot at me, her aim was not so accurate, it went through me. After she shot me — she put the gun at her throat and killed herself. That was a terrifying experience. The sight of her body that lay there was terrible I cannot now even tell you. I didn’t want to die. I was bleeding. I didn’t know what to do. I thought I was alone. Then from among the wounded another sister who was badly hurt cried out. She too did not want to die she said., “Save me, bullets have pierced me don’t let me die.” It was dark we were thirsty and in pain. I knew the leader, the doctor, had a pack with glucose and medicines. We had nothing to eat for two days. I dragged myself and found the pack and we both ate glucose — drank the water. At a distance — we found one of the brothers who was wounded come limping towards us from the other side. Only we three of us were alive. All three of us decided to surrender ourselves to the army. By morning the bodies smelled. It was a terrible sight. Army shouted at us and they asked us to put our hands up. I could not put up one hand. Sometimes that scene comes rushing into my mind. There is still anger in me for what she did. When I came here… I have forgotten dates and things. What do I want to do with my life? ... All that I want now is to study and study well. Anything, to study anything... Maybe dancing; I like dancing and music. I have studied in school. I like but will I ever get a chance? There is a person who likes me, he said he would marry me, but I don’t want to think of marriage. Now he has gone abroad. His mother comes to see me — even though they are the only people who like me. I cannot like him. I feel that he is too old. There is a difference of many years. I cannot love him, he writes letters — but how can I marry him? I am unable to decide anything now, I have fears and I am scared. Here they have planned to send me out of this place, this week — I am scared. I am not keen to go. They said that there is a dancing teacher and that I could learn dancing. I will have to help out with the nursery school. I will be given training and I can become a teacher. This looks good. I have fears. All that I know is — wherever I am, they (people in the armed movement) will kill me. In my mind I am always with the feeling that I will be killed. I know I should think of living but there is a feeling that death is hanging over my head. I am alone — I have no one. What can I do? I can’t find any meaning…There’s no life … No feeling towards marriage… I have nobody. Sometimes I feel frustrated. I have no happiness. Whatever I aspire for or need… I won’t get. I like to be like other children. How can I be? I don’t want to think of my future. I don’t want to dream of anything. For anything at all, as I won’t get anything. Yes there was one thing I wanted. I had a feeling of wanting to see my father at least. That will never ever happen. I know the thought of them is not going to bring them back — never… ever will I see them. I cried even yesterday. I have to leave this place... I am used to this place. I am scared because within three days I have to leave this place. How will my future be? I cannot forget all the painful things that have happened to me, now I am beginning to understand things and life seems different and clear. I feel I have done the wrong thing in choosing the wrong path of destruction. What to do? What has happened has happened. I cannot erase everything, I have to do something meaningful and good and that is one way of beginning to start to be happy. That is why I want to start a day care center for children. Nobody wants me; even here they are going to send me away, they say it is to a convent. I am nobody’s child! I don’t trust people. I don’t want to get close to anybody. If I get hurt even a bit I can’t bear that. So better I keep off. When people scold me I bear it up. I don’t talk back or anything. When I think back… Yes after I spoke to you and was thinking and thinking. Why did I get into to all that I did? All those actions were hardhearted actions, now makes me sad. Maybe I could have stayed at home. Everything was wrong from the beginning. Maybe I could have put up with my relatives’ cruelty; after all one of them was good to me. I know he liked me. If my grandmother had lived I would have never left home. She was the only one for me and she died.","Without parents to care for her, Abirami was forced to live at a relative’s house from a young age, where she suffered abuse and was later prevented from attending school so she could perform domestic duties for the family. She ran away to become a child soldier in Sri Lanka at the age of 13. Although Abirami joined the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers) movement voluntarily, rather than being abducted like many other children, her recruitment at such a young age is against international law and now considered a war crime.

I had to do all kinds of work in their home. During the rainy season, I also had to do a lot of cultivation. Mohammed often beat me. He also raped me many times. I had to sleep outside with the cows and the goats. He would come outside at night and have intercourse with me. Whenever I resisted, I got a bad beating. Mohammed and Howeya wanted me to be a Muslim woman, so they forced me to have my genitals cut. A man did it. I don’t know who he was. He tied my hands and legs down very tightly. You can still see the marks. It was so painful. I cried and cried. That was the worst thing they did to me. I am so happy to be here now.

The Communist-oriented New People’s Army, established in 1968, began an intense recruitment of children in the 1990s. By 2000, some 25 percent of new recruits were children, and more than ten percent of its regular combatants are now under 18. Parents volunteer children to serve as combatants and camp guards. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front allows the training of children as young as 12. Parents volunteer their children, seeing it as an observation of Islamic teaching, and Muslim youth organizations recruit students from schools and colleges. The Abu Sayyaf (“Bearer of the Sword”), a Muslim separatist group which appeared in the late 1980s, uses Islamic religion to draw minors into the movement, for use as combatants, human shields, and hostages."
Ajok A.,1999 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"","Ajok A. was ‘redeemed’ (bought out of slavery) by Christian Solidarity International (CSI), a Zurich-based international human rights organization, in 1999. Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Ajok,1999 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was visiting my younger sister’s home near Warawar when I was captured. It happened two years ago during the dry season. The soldiers came early in the morning. Everyone was asleep. My sister and I woke up with the sound of gunfire. We ran out of her tukul as fast as we could. But we did not get very far. We were surrounded. There were a lot of Arab soldiers all around us. Some wore uniforms, others wore jellabeyas. They had come at night on camels and horses. Six soldiers grabbed me. I struggled with them and tried to get away. But they beat me with a big stick. I had to submit. You can see the scar on my back. I got that wound during the beating. They tied my hand together with a rope and led me away to the bush. They raped me in the bush, one after the other, all six of them. After that, I had to walk beyond the River Kiir with the other slaves. My hands were tied to a long rope. My sister was tied to it too. Along the way we were beaten and raped. We walked for four days. Then we reached a place where the soldiers divided us and the cows and goats amongst themselves. I was given to Musa. My sister was given to a man named Ibrahim. Musa was a good friend of the leader of the raiders, Mahmoud Issa from Zeri. Musa had a body guard and was responsible for distributing slaves and cattle amongst the Popular Defense Force This meant that he was away from home a lot. Musa took me to his home in Gos. I had to do housework for his wife. She is an Arab woman named Howah. She is a very bad woman. She always loved to hit me with a big stick, even when I was ill. She made me sleep outside in the courtyard. There was no shelter over my head. Only when it rained did she let me sleep in the covered cattle pen. Sometimes Musa would come to me at night, and take me to the cattle pen for sex. Whenever Howah discovered that her husband was missing at night, she would give me a good beating on the next day because her husband had come to me and not to her. I had Musa’s baby. He is now seven months old. Musa called him Ahmed, but I call him Thiop. Musa called me Howah, so he had two Howahs. The worst part about being with Musa and Howah were their threats to kill me. Whenever they told me to get water from a far place, or do some other hard labor, they would say that they would cut my throat if I didn’t obey. Musa would threaten me like this when he wanted to have sex with me. My sister’s throat was cut by her master. Howah’s children told me they saw her body when they were going to the well. They said she had tried to escape, but was caught. My sister had a very strong will. I remember that she always showed displeasure when the soldiers called her Fatima during the walk to the North. I was so afraid, I thought I have to get away from there. I knew that Musa loved Thiop and would never let him go, so I wanted to escape with him. One day, I was told by a woman who was cultivating in the fields that a trader was looking for slaves to return to their homes. I decided to escape and ran with Thiop to the forest. There I came across a Dinka man who took care of me and helped me find the trader. He brought me back here. I like being back, and hearing my own name again. I also like it because no one calls me ‘slave’ or ‘nigger’ anymore… Now I will go to Warawar to try to find my children and my father.","Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains.

Alana,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Moldova (trafficked from),Russia (slavery location),"I was born in Costesti. I have one older sister. My father died when I was young and we were always very poor. In November 2003 a gypsy man in the village offered for me and my sister to work in Russia. He told us he buys goods from Moldova and we can sell them in a market in Moscow. He paid 6000 lei [$470] for two passports and bought us train tickets. My mother was very sick at that time, so I prayed we could send her money for heating wood and medicine. When we came to Moscow, the man’s wife picked us from the train station. She took us to a small house where there were four other Moldovan girls. She told us we would go to the market in the morning, and she locked us inside. The other girls asked if we knew why we were there. We saw clothes hanging on the wall for nuns. There was the name of a Church written on them, but I could not read it in Russian. The other girls told us we would dress like nuns and beg for money. In the morning when the wife returned, my sister told her we would not do this kind of work. She told us it was better than selling goods and we would make more money. We worked like this for two weeks from eight in the morning until late at night, but we could not keep any money. After two weeks they moved us to another apartment with other girls. There were three gypsy men here who beat us badly and told us we must have sex with clients. I panicked and told them I would not do this work, but they raped me and said: “If you behave well, you can go back to Moldova in one year. If you do not, we will kill you and no one will look for you.” Every day many clients came for sex, and every day these men beat us. They punched our ribs and our back, but not our face. I cried when I watched them rape my sister. I wished they would kill me. The men moved us to many apartments for two years. We could never escape because they always locked us inside. One day they moved us to the street and we tried to escape, but the men caught us and beat us badly. We tried a second time and we made it to the train station. The police asked for our passport, and we explained what happened. They took us to detention for one week and deported us to Moldova. When we came back to Costesti, my mother thought we had been dead. One week later, the same gypsy man who first took us to Moscow came to our home at five in the morning. He had other gypsy men with him, and he said we must return to Moscow and pay off our debt. He tried to take us, but my sister and I ran. My mother could not run, so they raped her. We told the police the next day, but the gypsies were gone, and they never found the man who did this to us.","Alana was born in Moldova and trafficked into sex slavery in Russia, where men and women are also trafficked in from Central Asia and North Korea for forced labor and sexual exploitation. Moldova is a country origin for the trafficking of women and children into European sex slavery. Its economic conditions fuel this trafficking. In 2000, the country’s GDP was 40 percent of its level in 1990. Unemployment remains high, especially among women. People are forced to look outside of the country for work and pimps take advantage: some victims are kidnapped but more often they answer job advertisements promising work and then are forced into sex slavery. Most Moldovan trafficking victims are taken to the Balkan countries, though other destinations include Asia, Turkey, Western Europe and the Middle East."
Alexia,1999 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,The Dominican Republic (slavery location) Trinidad and Tobago (slavery location) Venezuela (trafficked from),Venezuela (slavery location),"When I was a child, I didn’t have a family. I never knew who my father was, and my mother died when I was still a little girl. I had no one to care for me—to raise and love me I started to be used in prostitution when I was still a girl. The first time, a man raped me. When I was 14, I escaped prostitution when a man married me. I had a son with him, and I divorced him two years later. I had no other choices, so I returned to prostitution to get money to support my son. Things happened very quickly. Later, I was living with another man, as my partner. He was unfaithful to me, so I left and ended up in prostitution again. I didn’t become involved in that by myself. I was led there. I don’t believe anyone gets into prostitution by herself. I worked for many years in very unpalatable conditions. Nobody in my family—my kids, no one—knew what I did. I had to do this to survive. I had to sacrifice myself. What I did, I did for my children. I have lived in the same place for 24 years, and no one knows anything about this. No one associated with the prostitution knows my real name. We always use different names. I am the sort of person who is very private. I don’t have many friendships. If anyone said to one of my friends that I was in prostitution, they would say they didn’t believe it. I was trafficked, too. I was trafficked to Trinidad and Tobago. The clients in Trinidad and Tobago were of Indian descent and Chinese. I got into this through a man who used to go to different places where the women were in prostitution, and ask, “Would you like to go to Trinidad and Tobago? Who wants to go?” On one occasion, I said, “I want to go.” The man who arranged all this charged each girl around 6000 Bolivares. After a week’s work we were expected to pay him this amount. Around ten of us from the Dominican Republic, Columbia and Venezuela would gather in Carupano, a port city in Venezuela. We were transported by sea in a little boat to Trinidad under very dangerous conditions. There was always the risk that the boat would capsize. We went without legal documents. We were allowed to take only our handbags. If we were caught by immigration, we would be taken to prison and remain there for five, six months. When we arrived, we were taken to an apartment, which belonged to the man who did the negotiation. We were forced to work everyday whether we were ill or not, whether we had our menstrual periods or not. I was trying to save money to buy an apartment, but when I returned to Venezuela, the customs officials took all the money in foreign currencies—dollars and Caribbean dollars—leaving me with only a few Bolivares. I needed more money to live with my son, so I accepted an invitation from a Venezuelan pimp to go to the Dominican Republic. A friend took care of my son while I was away. He gave me an airline ticket and a passport to go to Puerto Plata for nine months. We were forced to work every day whether we were ill or not. Although prostitution in the Dominican Republic is illegal, many underground situations exist. In Venezuela there is a great problem with how the police treat women in prostitution. The police can come whenever they want to places where we are working, demanding to see our papers. The way they treat us is horrendous. Even when we had ID cards and all our papers in order, we were taken to prison and had to pay a certain amount of money to be let free. If a girl didn’t have papers or her papers were out of date, it was very likely that she’d be raped. I know of case of a campaniera who worked with me. One day, on a Sunday morning, we exchanged greetings and said, “Goodbye, see you later.” On Monday, the headlines in the newspaper said that the body of a girl had been found in the Guerre River. They identified her as a woman who sold imported clothing. We were totally unaware that it was our campaniera who had been killed, and the investigation continued to be carried out. On Tuesday, the police arrived at our place of work, and ordered all of us downstairs. They began to ask questions and showed us pictures. Suddenly, we realized that the murdered woman was our campaniera. The inquiry continued for about two weeks. Each day, for 15 days, they would come and question us. Supposedly, our campaniera was waiting for a taxi at 12 o’clock at night when she left work. The last time that she was seen was when she called on the cops. The next day her belongings had disappeared, and she was naked. And when the police went to her room, where she lived, they found a policeman’s uniform belonging to her boyfriend. We surmised that she was beaten up, and then thrown into the river while she was still alive. She died there. The police were confronted with a very unpalatable situation. The chief of police did not want to admit that one of the police had actually been involved in this case because it was a prostitute woman who had been killed. Journalists bombarded the chief of police, and he had to admit the truth. He didn’t want anybody to know, particularly her family, her sisters, and so on. In the end we still don’t know what happened to her. There are rumors that the police killed her. This is the way it goes when we talk about victims, about women in prostitution. I was in prostitution for about 20 years. Then I came across a Sister from the Good Shepherd community who was also there. And I became involved in training programs that they had—beauty training, sewing, and embroidery, and others that they offer. I followed the whole gamut of programs that they offer, and became a graduate of those programs. I also met a very good man who I married. I’m glad I left prostitution. I left behind all the problems that I had to confront with the police and the beatings by the owners of the different businesses. It was such a horrendous experience—too much, too much. After my own experiences in prostitution, I want to ensure that all women can get out of that situation. My experience of 20 years in prostitution is something that I don’t want for anybody. What was most beneficial to me in getting out of prostitution was to become involved in the programs offered by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd Community. They helped me a great deal and enabled me to get out. The way the sisters used to deal with me, they used say, “Alexia, you’re not cut out for this sort of work. You don’t belong to that work.” And I was saying to myself, “I have two children, there is something that I need to do for them.” Finally, I wanted to leave, and I left. I want to say that even though I was part of this world I never smoked. I hated drugs. I never became involved with alcohol. I was able to bear it because of my children, because of my family. Prostitution should never be legalized. Can you imagine if it becomes legalized? Everything will be chaos. Labor laws in Venezuela allow for minors to work with parental permission. At the moment we have an avenue, LaCuña Avenue, in Venezuela where you can see young girls of 13, 14 years of age, soliciting. It is a disaster.","Born in Venezula, Alexia was trafficked through Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago. She went on to work in Venezuela with an organization that helps women to escape from sex slavery. Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Venezuelan women and girls are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation to Western Europe and Mexico, in addition to Caribbean destinations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, and the Dominican Republic. Men, women, and children from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.) are trafficked to and through Venezuela and may be subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. In addition, Venezuelan women and girls are trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation, recruited from poor regions in the nation’s interior to urban and tourist areas through false job offers."
Alina,2000 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from),United Arab Emirates (slavery location),"I met my boyfriend at my girlfriend’s house. He had been dating me for a month already when he told me he was going to marry me. My boyfriend told me we could earn some money for our wedding if we went to work in Greece at his friend’s company. We would stay for three months there to earn enough money and come back. I was extremely happy. I could not believe all that was happening to me. He took my passport and all necessary papers and said that he would take care of visa and travel arrangements. I was so happy and careless that I did not even ask to see the tickets or documents. The day of departure came. We took the plane and instead of Greece we landed in Dubai. As I had not been abroad before I could not really understand where I was. I could only recognize the Arabic signs and people dressed in Arabic robes. When I asked why we landed in Dubai he said we would have to stay for a couple of days in Dubai, and then later we would go to Greece. He took me to a hotel and said that he was going to see his friend and would be back soon. Two hours later a man came to take me to another hotel saying that I was his property. I could not understand, I kept saying that it was a misunderstanding and that my friend would come soon. I had come to Dubai for another purpose. The man told me that my friend had sold me to him, that from now on he would have my documents and I had to do whatever he told me to. He said that the next day I had to move to another place and serve all the clients he would send to me. I was shocked by what was happening. The next day he came and took me to another hotel. He said that every day I had to give him $500, no matter how many clients I would serve. He was so violent. It was a continuous hell. Each day I served around 30 to 40 clients. I was not able to move or think. It went on for weeks. I was living between clients and tears. That was the rhythm of my life. I could not even realize what they wanted from me. The intensity of the process lasted for a couple of weeks. One day I got terribly sick. He left me alone and sent another Armenian woman to visit me. That day I understood that it was an organized enterprise and that there were many women from many countries who shared the same fate. Meanwhile the pimp refused to give back my passport because of the debts he said he had incurred on account of me. I had to work and earn money if I wanted to go back home. Then he introduced me to another man telling me that he had sold me to him and that I had to take my passport from him. The next day I was beaten like for the first time. He was an extremely cruel man. He came every morning to pick up his money and beat me terribly. I had no right to speak or express my concern, everybody knew him well for his cruelty. I did not receive any money from him. He did not even buy food. It all depended on the client’s will. I was resold four times. One of my clients was trying to kill me. If it were not for the women in the next room I would have been killed. In his frenzy the man was beating me. He squeezed my throat. Luckily enough there was a police raid in the hotel where I was working and I was taken together with other women to a police station and detained. My pimp did not do anything to release me from prison. I spent four months there. Though it was prison and the conditions were terrible, it was incomparable with what I had gone through before that. Nobody was cruel or rude to me there and I had to wait while my temporary documents from Armenia and the ticket for deportation were arranged. I came back without any money. All I had before remained with the pimp, I could not pick up anything. The most shameful thing happened at Yerevan airport. Everybody was treating me as if I were a prostitute, saying bad words. My life has changed since that time. Now you see me here in the street. I have become a real prostitute.","Born in Armenia, Alina was promised work in Greece but instead trafficked to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where an estimated 10,000 women from sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, Iraq, Iran, and Morocco are victims of sex trafficking. Women from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Uganda, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, the Philippines, Iraq, Iran, and Morocco are reportedly trafficked to the UAE. for commercial sexual exploitation. Some foreign women were reportedly recruited to work as secretaries or hotel workers by third country recruiters, but were coerced into prostitution or domestic servitude."
Amasya,2000 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from),Turkey (slavery location),"When the war started I decided to go to Karabakh to help wounded soldiers. I was there during the whole period of military activities. After the cease-fire I came to Armenia, but there was no work and no means to live. My neighbor was going to Turkey to do trade. She said that the Turkish agency could help us in getting a job that would allow us to earn some money to buy products to sell in Armenia. This was a very good way out for me; at least I thought so. We went to the Turkish bus agency and bought tickets. The bus operator said that it was always possible to get a job in Turkey and their agency could help us there. Everything was going very well. In Istanbul the agency recommended us to a man who introduced himself as an owner of a sewing factory. He said that that even if we did not know how to sew clothing he could still arrange a job there. He always needed helping hands. He also advised us to rent a small apartment of somebody he knew well. That day he asked us to give him our passports for registering us as temporary residents. We did not object. The next day he took us to his 'factory.' It was not a factory at all, it was a massage parlor or brothel, we could not understand. He told us that we should clean up there and prepare coffee and drinks to serve to customers. He told us that we should wear short dresses and other pieces of very vulgar clothing. We did not want to do that, but we realized that we had no choice. At the end of the month we asked for the salary, but he said that we had not earned the promised amount of $400, but that he could give us only $100 to cover the rent for the flat. We could earn the rest by providing sexual services to men. If we did not agree we would never receive our passports. As our visas had already expired and we were staying illegally in Turkey they could send us to prison. I could not believe that it was happening to me: that somebody could use my vulnerable situation and threaten me. Next day I went to him and said that I would agree to his proposal if he gave back my money and passport. He agreed to give me money, but he said that he needed my passport to extend the visa. Two weeks later he gave me only $200 instead of $700, and explained that it was due to costs related to food and expenses for visa extension. We worked 12 to 14 hours instead of the agreed ten. He said that he had also bribed the police to leave me unpunished for working illegally in Turkey. I realized that this man was going to create big problems for me if I did not take some steps. The next day we told him that we would go to the police if he did not pay us and give back our passports. He said that the next day he would have the passport and money ready. When we came home that night our landlord said that he could not let us in anymore because we were illegal. He refused to let us in and we could not even take our belongings. We had no other choice than go to the police department. We were unable to make ourselves understood nor did we have any documents, so they kept us one night at the police station. The next day we were taken to the immigration police for deportation. Thanks God our stay was not long: we had to stay there for one night, as the bus to Armenia was leaving in the morning and the drivers agreed to take us to Armenia on the condition that we would pay them in Yerevan. I do not want to remember again the night that we spent in the immigration police. Even though I have seen the horrors of war, that night was unimaginable.","Born in Armenia but unable to find work there, Amasya was trafficked to Turkey, where victims also arrive from Ukraine and Moldova, and manipulated into a situation of prostitution. As well as Turkey and the UAE, Armenian women and girls are trafficked for sexual exploitation to Russia, Greece, and other European countries. It is estimated that 480,000 people are living in slavery in Turkey. The Turkish government significantly increased its law enforcement response in 2007 by convicting and punishing more traffickers. However, there is a lack of secure and consistent government support for trafficking shelters, hindering Turkey’s anti-trafficking efforts."
Anita,1999 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My name is Anita Sharma Bhattarai. I am 28 years old. I am from Nepal. Last year, my husband took another wife. Soon after, he began to beat me, torment me, and disregard my children. I decided it would be best if I and my children moved out of our home. I made money by buying vegetables from farmers and selling them in the village market. On November 22, last year, I boarded the bus in order to go pay for my vegetables. I sat next to a Nepali man and woman. They offered me a banana to eat and I took it. Soon after I ate the banana, while I was still on the bus, I got a very bad headache. I told the man and woman that I had a headache and they offered me a pill and a bottle of mineral water to help me swallow the medicine. Immediately, I felt myself becoming groggy and then I fell unconscious. The next thing that I remember is waking up in the train station in Gorakhpur, India. I am from a mountain village. I did not know what a train was and, of course, I had never been to India. I asked the man where I was. I was confused by the long cars that I was riding and the strange surroundings. The man told me not to cry out. He informed me that there were drugs tied around my waist and that I had just smuggled them across an international border. He told me that if I brought the attention of the police, I would be in trouble for smuggling the drugs. I did not remember the drugs being tied around my waist but I could feel plastic bags under my dress. The man also told me that if I stayed with him, I would receive 20,000 rupees [$400] from the sale of the drugs when we arrived in Bombay. I did not know how to get back to Nepal, I do not speak any of the Indian languages, and I believed that I was already in trouble for carrying drugs. The man told me he was my friend and that I could refer to him as my brother. I decided to stay with him. It was a five-day journey to Bombay by train. When we got to Bombay, he told me to wait at the train station while he went to sell the drugs. When he returned, he told me that the police had confiscated his drugs and that he did not have any money. He said that I would have to go to his friend’s house and wait while he got us some money. He called his friend on the phone from the train station, and she came to meet us there. She was a Nepali woman. She said her name was Renu Lama. I left the train station with Renu Lama. My “brother” told me that he would meet me at her house at 4pm that afternoon. As I walked with Renu Lama, she told me not to look at people because she lived in a very dangerous neighborhood and there were some bad people that I should not make eye contact with. When we arrived at her house, Renu Lama told me that I should take a bath. I told her that I would wait until 4pm when my “brother” came because he was carrying my clothes. She told me my “brother” was not coming. I waited until evening but he never came. Finally, I took a bath and Renu Lama gave me some of her old clothes to wear. Renu Lama then asked if I could write a letter for her. I did. She dictated what she wanted to say to her family, and I wrote the letter. When I had finished writing the letter, Renu Lama took away the ink pen. She went to my room and took away all of the pens, pencils, and paper that I could possibly write with. I realized that the writing of the letter had been a test. Now that they knew I was literate, they were keen to keep me from communicating with anyone outside. I felt very scared that evening and I refused to eat anything. I soon noticed that many men were coming in and out of the house and I realized it was a brothel. I began howling and shouting. I said that I wanted to leave. Renu Lama told me that I was ignorant. She said that I did not just come easily and I could not go easily. She said that I had been bought and I would have to work as a prostitute in order to pay them back. I was never told how much they had paid for me. Renu Lama and two of her associates told me that all the women in the house were “sisters” and that we had to support each other. I cried a lot, but they comforted me and brought me a fine dinner, complete with chutney and a pickle. The next day, though, I insisted that I wanted to leave. The women began to slap me on the face. They cut off my hair. It was shoulder length in the back with short bangs in the front. Now that I had short hair, I knew that I could not leave the brothel without everyone identifying me as a prostitute. In my culture, short hair is the sign of a wild woman. Then, I was told that all of the women in the brothel had to bathe three or four times each day. The women all bathe nude and they bathed together—four or five girls at a time. I had never bathed nude before and I had never bathed with other naked women. When I expressed my shyness, the other women mocked me. They grabbed me and stripped off my clothes. They forced me to bathe with them. For the next couple of days the women beat me often. They slapped me on the face and head with their hands and hit me about the waist and thighs with metal rods. I begged to be let go. I said that I wanted to return to my children in time for the biggest holiday of our culture. The women mocked me. They told me that if I worked with them for a couple of days, they would send me home with three bricks of gold and 30,000-40,000 rupees [$600-850] for the festival. I was also forced to learn Hindi—the language of most of the customers. When I couldn’t speak enough Hindi, I was beaten about the waist and thighs with iron rods. When I was alone with one of the other women, I offered her my gold earring if she would let me go. She said no. Later I learned that three of the women were in the brothel voluntarily and they were in charge. The six other women in the brothel, I learned, had all been tricked and forced like me. Renu Lama and the woman to whom I had offered my earring were in the brothel voluntarily. All of the women in the brothel were from Nepal. The six who were forced had all been brought from Nepal but under different pretenses. One girl married a man who said he was taking her to Bombay to buy gold. He then left her in a brothel. None of the other girls could read or write. I am literate because I am Brahmin and the women in my community are educated. The women tried to reassure me that being a prostitute was not that bad. All of my food, housing, and clothes were provided. All I would have to do, they said, was sell my body. On the fourth day that I was in the brothel, my first client came to me. I refused to have sex with him. He had already paid so he grabbed me and tried to rape me. I fought him off. He had managed to get my clothes off but he was very frustrated because I was resisting him so much. He stormed out and asked for his money back. A couple of the brothel owners came in and beat me. When they were done, the same man came back in. I then said that I would have sex with him only if he wore a condom. I knew about the need for condoms since I had learned that some of the other victims had very bad diseases. At first he refused but after another fight he finally agreed. By the time he left he had used three condoms. I only had one client my first day. But the next day, and everyday after, I had three or four clients each day. I managed to get an ink pen. I would write messages to the police on the inside of cigarette boxes and send them out with my clients. Many clients promised to help but none did. Still, I was not able to go out to buy the condoms myself. In fact, for the entire month-and-a-half that I was in the brothel, I was never allowed to go out into the sun. Some of the other girls got to go to the hospital when they fell ill. But I never got sick, so I could never leave. I lived on the second floor of the brothel. The six of us who had been brought there against our will were kept on the second floor. There were no windows on our floor. The three who ran the brothel lived downstairs. Downstairs there was a door that led outside. Several iron rods used for beating were leaned against the wall beside the door. One of the owners always guarded the door. Outside the door was a metal gate. When customers were not coming in and out, the gate was closed. The gate was held by a heavy chain that was locked by a large padlock. One night I tried to run away with one of my associates. We were caught by the brothel owners before we even made it to the gate. My friend was sold to another brothel in Sarat where the brothels are said to be even more tortuous than the ones in Colaba, Bombay, where I was held. After serving clients for about eight days, an elderly man came to me as a client. When I was alone with him in the room, I told him that he was old enough to be my father. I told him, “I am like your daughter.” I told him my story. He said that he had plenty of money and a Nepali friend. He promised to help me escape. He spent the entire night with me. That was the first time I had been with a client for more than an hour. I cried on him all night long. The next morning, he left with a promise that he would send his Nepali friend to help me. He said that I would know his friend had come when a Nepali man came to the brothel, asking to be with Anita, and carrying a gift of candies. A few days later, a young Nepali man came to see me. He brought a gift of candy. I told him my story. He promised to help me escape. I told him that I did not trust anyone. In order for me to trust him, he would have to go to Nepal, report about me to my father and brother, and bring back some of my personal photographs as a result. The elderly client paid for him to go to Nepal. Before he left, the boy gave me his address in Bombay. Some of my associates overheard the owners saying that they were also planning to sell me to a brothel in Sarat because I was too much trouble. I decided that I could not wait until the boy returned from Nepal. I had to try again to run away. I asked some of the other girls to run with me, but they were too afraid. We had been told that we would be killed if we tried to run away. But I had determined that I would rather die than stay in the brothel. The other girls pooled their money together and came up with 200 rupees [$4]. In exchange for the 200 rupees, I promised that if I made it out alive, I would get help for them. A couple of days later, I had a perfect opportunity. Renu Lama was out of town again. The owner who was watching the gate was drunk. A new maid had just been hired to clean and cook in the brothel. The new maid was doing chores and had left the gate open just a little bit. In the middle of the night, I would guess about 4am, I ran out of the brothel. I was wearing only my nightgown and carrying my slip in my hand. I ran down the street as fast as I could. As I was running I saw two police officers. There were in civilian clothes but I knew they were police officers by the belts they were wearing. I ran to them, told them my story, and handed them the address of the Nepali boy. They took 100 rupees [$2] from me in order to pay for a taxi. They put me in a taxi that took me to the Nepali boy’s house. When I arrived at the house, the Nepali boy was not there. But another Nepali man and his wife were. They were friends of the Nepali boy and they agreed to take me in. The police left me with that family. I did not know it at that time, but that same day, the Nepali boy had met Bob—Robert Mosier, director of investigations at the International Justice Mission. He told Bob my story. Soon after I ran away from the brothel, Bob and the police raided the brothel where I had been. After searching the brothel, they learned that I had run away earlier that night. They came with Bob and met me at the house where I was staying. Bob told me that I could go back to the brothel to get my things. I was too scared to go back because I thought I might be forced to be a prostitute again. But Bob assured me that I was safe. I went back to the brothel with Bob. I showed him hiding places where they found the other girls. All of the girls who were forced were released from the brothel and a way was provided for them to go back home. The two owners who were there that night are now in jail. Bob also arranged for me to return home to my family in Nepal. When I first went home to my family, it was very uncomfortable. The people in the village laughed at me. In my culture, a woman is scorned if she is missing for just one night. I had been missing for two months. It was very hard for my family, especially since we are members of the Brahmin caste. So, today I live in Kathmandu. I work as a domestic servant in the city. I am still without my children since they went to live with their father when I was taken away. I am told that my husband’s new wife is very cruel to my children, but my husband does not want my children to be with me because of where I have been. I know that my story will help other women who are forced into prostitution. I am proud that I was able to help Bob free the other girls in the brothel where I worked. Though I am grateful to be here to share my story, I am sad that I am not with my children—that my children cannot be here with me.","Anita was trafficked from Nepal to India in 1998 at the age of 27. Her narrative emphasizes the uniquely female elements of slavery. She describes her pain as a mother separated from her children, mentions the idea that the women in the brothel are her “sisters,” seeks escape by offering an earring to one woman, and finally escapes when another woman accidentally leaves a gate open. She gains empathy from a client by telling him: “I am like your daughter.” Even Anita’s psychological turning-point from freedom to slavery is female specific. “They cut off my hair,” she remembers. “I could not leave the brothel without everyone identifying me as a prostitute…short hair is the sign of a wild woman.” Thousands of Nepali women and children are trafficked every year across the border into Indian brothels, and Nepal has an unknown number of internal sex trafficking victims as well. In response to a dowry practice, where they must offer gifts that could be worth several years’ income, some parents sell their daughters rather than have them married. Other women are drugged and taken across the border, like Anita. Once enslaved, Nepali girls and women are more likely to be arrested than rescued by the police, and most Nepalese victims never leave India, even after liberation. Those who do are often shunned by their families and remain in Kathmandu at shelters. Anita describes such familial rejection in the wake of her experience."
Anyang,1999 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location) ,"I was captured in April 1998. Several hundred Arab Murahaleen attacked our village in the afternoon. They came on horses and many wore army uniforms. My husband Garang Acuil Atany was at Warawar at the time of the attack. I don’t know whether he is still alive. The attackers took myself, my children Acien Garang and Garang Acuil and a son of my sister who happened to be with us at the time of the attack. I was pregnant at that time. The raiders ordered me to milk the stolen cattle on the way. I also had to lead the cattle with a stick and carried loot on my head at the same time. Some of the stolen children had to lead the goats. We were forced to march fast because the raiders feared that they would be attacked by our people from behind. We walked for five days until we reached Adeela. I thought that I would die on the way because I was totally exhausted. In Adeela we were divided. The two children stayed with me. I was given to an Arab by the name of Hamid. He ordered me to milk his cows… It will be good to die in my own land. I am very happy now.","Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Anywar,2008 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Uganda (trafficked from),Uganda (slavery location),"I’m Anywar Ricky Richard, the founder of Friends of Orphans, based in northern Uganda in Pader District. We work with former child soldiers. I know a lot about former child soldiers because I was one time I was child soldier. I was abducted when I was at the age of fourteen years and forced to fight adult’s wars. We work to rehabilitate former child soldiers, reintegrate them, and empower them so that they gain their life back. Our experience with them, and my personal experience as a former child soldier, is that a child soldier doesn't destroy only the family or the person, but they destroy the whole community. A former child soldier, as I said, doesn't only destroy the life of the child, but they destroy the life of the family and the life of the community, in that to regain back their normal life, to be useful people, useful citizen, is very difficult. Because they go through a lot of trauma in the bush, and the child soldiers, they are made to fight adult’s wars. They are made to do things not of their own will. These destroy first of all their emotional feelings about human being. They feel so bad about human being; they feel human being destroyed their life because they did not gain the normal childhood life any other children can experience. I was abducted with my elder brother, and other three children from this same village where we lived. Then we moved in the bush, and we were tied up with our hands behind us, and one rope was connected to another person, so we were in chain and tied up with our hands behind. We moved for about three days with no food, no water, until the fourth day, that's when they gave us some food and some water we took. From there we kept moving, and I saw horrible things in the bush. First, I'd never seen this kind of beating which these people could do. Whenever they get you, they'd beat you, they'd kill. I'd never seen that before, so it was horrible for me to see people being killed, people being beaten, especially the women and children. It was really so, so bad for me. I didn't like it, and I saw it as something I never wanted to do, and I never wanted to be in there, but unfortunately, we were guarded twenty-four hours by the commanders. We could not escape. There was no way we could escape. So we remained in there. I always tried my best, but if I could get any chance, I would escape. But you couldn't get any chance to escape. In the night, we undressed and tied up together so that you have no chance of escaping because they believe that in the night, maybe somehow somewhere you could get a way of escaping. They could send us scaring messages every day that if you escape they would kill you in the most horrible way. And they used to do that. We used to see that some of our friends would try, some of the children try to escape, and they're brought back when they're caught and they kill them. At one point, I remember they brought some man who had escaped. He escaped like today, then the following day we got him and he was brought. I saw about fifty people beating him in all parts. And … I don't remember what happened next, but somehow, somewhere, someone told them, one of the commanders said, “Please stop, stop,” because he was lying. Then he woke up. He got up. And when he got up, the jaw was broken. One of the finger was also broken and was looking weak. They call us together, then they told us, “Uh huh, today you've seen” – that's after only, I think, two days of – yeah, two days when I was abducted, then that happened. And they brought up this man. They didn't tie him; they made him to sit down. Then they call out us around and they told us, “Okay, you people, you want to escape. I know some of you are planning to escape, and today we are going to show you if you escape what will happen to you.” They brought some boy called Patrick with the panga [large knife] to cut him up. So one of the commander went in front when he was seated down like this, then pointed a gun at him, [and said] that “Look at my eyes straight, and if you dare to run, I will be the one to shoot you. I'm going to kill you.” He mentioned his name, then he hollered at Patrick to cut off his neck. So Patrick was fearing, but there was no way. He didn't show, though, that he was fearing, but from the action I saw that he was fearing because when he cut off once, the panga went off. Then there's another person now, one of the commander came and cut him off, then they told us that, “Uh huh, have you seen what happened? If you escape, we are going to kill you in that way.” What pained me most is that the boy didn't cry. I never heard him crying till he died. And the most horrible thing about it is that the sister was there seeing, and it was so bad; it was so painful. To me, what I saw is when – because when they cut off the neck from behind, he fell down on his back, then they started cutting the neck, the face, and everywhere. So I was close to my brother. Now they told us, all of us, to cut him, so people started cutting, the recruits. You cut him until they see that you now, you are not fearing to kill, then they tell you that, okay, leave, pass the panga to the next person; he cuts like this. So I was behind my brother, my brother came and cut him, and he was completely chopped up. So one of the commanders said “Stop. The rest, go.” Then unfortunately the next person who followed me behind, they told him “No, no, no. Now what you do, you move, you walk on him.” So people walked on him so that they would get the courage of killing, the courage of doing atrocities. And when we all passed, then they stop us again. They said, “Uh huh, do you know what happened? We didn't kill this man; it's you people who have killed him. So the spirit of this man will keep coming around whenever you escape, will keep guiding you back until you come back to us because you killed him. That's you. He escaped…so now you have also escaped, so you have done the mistake, and you should be killed as well.” So that's what they told us about him. We went and slept. [I was abducted] on Friday, the third [of] May, around 3:00 p.m. We heard a gunshot. We were staying at home, in a nearby market, which is about one and a half kilometers away from here. There was some rebel groups who had come to raid the market. I think there were two groups who didn't know themselves that they were around our village. So one group came first and went and shot in the market; they raided the market. So when we heard that, we were curious, we wanted to find out what happened. Did they kill people? What did they do? So we moved from home with my elder brother and sat just about fifty meters away from home along the road side. Then some friends of ours from the village, other children, also came and joined us. We were waiting for any possibility of someone had escaped and could come and tell us the story. Then I think it frustrated another group when they heard a gunshot in the market, so they decided to raid our village and a man came riding a bicycle. He was putting on civilian clothing, and he had a gun boot for the army. So we were contemplating who is this, and he came and stopped and started conversing with us. He was very friendly. He was just trying to buy time so that other people with guns could come in in a bigger group. So the next thing I saw was a man who was dreaded [gestures to indicate hair], bare chest, and putting on army uniform with gun boots. He came – we were sitting down. He came and started kicking us, and I got scared and I knew that, oh, today we are being abducted. So another person came in as well, and they started coming in and all that. So our parents were fifty meters at home. I could see them peeping, looking at what was taking place, what they were doing at us. So as we were abducted, they did not run. I think to them they said, no, since Ricky and the brother has been abducted, there's no way now. We cannot run. So they stayed at home here. They were behind, right at this house. So this one [who] was dreaded came in, and had was beating people hard and doing all these kind of things. Then at one point they call us in, we came, and what I saw is they were putting them, all of them, my mom, my dad, my sisters, my brothers, and some three people from around the village; they got them from the eastern side. They came with them. And they put them in that grass thatch house, and they locked the door, and they set it ablaze. Then we were sit – we sat there to watch, and we heard what was happening. They were crying in the house for help and hollered. It was horrible. It was the toughest moment I think I've ever seen in my life. They made us to sit and wait until the noise were not coming. I think they were all dead now. So that is what happened during my abduction. As I told you before, I was abducted in front of my powerless family who could not defend us from abduction. And as a result, again, they were burned down in the house. So after the house fell down – it was completely burned down – they came and tied us up together with our hands behind, then they pass the rope from our waist to the next person. They did not strip us by then. So we went to the next school where I was going to school by then. We got a bigger group, and before that we followed that main road. As we were following the main road in a single line, one of the rebels came and lied down in front of us and was aiming at us to shoot us. I got very, very scared, and we had nowhere to go. From behind they were beating us, in front this man, you can step on him, he will kill you definitely. Just a few minutes, all the things happened very quick. From here when they killed my parents, that's when we were taken. The harassment started there, and they were harassing us. When we went, we got a more bigger group, there under a tree in the school. Then that group had also captured – they had abducted a lot of people. So they screen us from there. The younger ones, which we were among them, we were only seven who are left. The rest were killed there. Some from the near village here. One of my uncle was killed there as well again. Then they burned down the school. I never seen this kind of thing. I'd never seen a big fire like that. It was a very big -- you know that whole house being on fire. There were very many people, but I couldn't count the number really because the whole thing is scary. But I saw…could be around twenty people who were there, and all of them were killed. We remain only seven, then they took us. They burned down the school, then they cut down all the bicycles. There were about, like, ten bicycles. They used pangas to cut them down. They removed the tubes that went with it. And it was a little bit late now, around six in the evening. They made us to move in one line. We went, and around nine we got another bigger group and they were only waiting for us, this group who had come to raid our village. So when we arrived they all went. But as we were approaching there were some young girls who were questioning us, I think talking to the commanders, and we could hear it. “Captain, why have you brought these children with distend stomachs here? Why didn't you kill them from there?” And I was scared. I was afraid. We went, and somewhere they told us to enter the bush. We entered into the bush, and they told us that this is where you're going to sleep. So they came and removed our shirts; they removed our shorts. We remained naked. And six people came, and surrounded us with the guns and told us that if you dare escape, we will shoot you. Many times what they do is indoctrination. They indoctrinate you to be reintegrated into their system through teaching. And that is done by the commanders, but there are specialized people who can do that. Through talking, one thing they could tell us is that if you dare to escape, then you will find on the way a very big snake. This snake will not bite you, but will keep teasing you, coming to you, and directing you until it takes you back to them, and they will capture you and kill you. Or else if you dare escape, you will meet a very big mountain, and you'll keep moving along the mountain until they will get you. You keep rotating that mountain. Then another thing is that you will get a very big flooded river as you escape. And you will see they are trying to cross the river, and we will get you. So we'll kill you. And they tell us that when you hear gun shots when we attack, sides and the other side, the sides are for the killers. If you move on this side, they will kill you. If you move on the other side, they will kill you. If you remain back, they will still kill you. But if you go in front, nothing will happen. Even the bullets shot cannot get you – you'll not be shot by the bullet. So these are some of the stories they could tell us. Then on the action side, that is the theory of it. The action side is that when they bring people, when they want to punish people, it’s the children to do that. When they're beating people, they want to beat someone, they order you, the children, to beat them up. And when they're killing, it's the children to do that. The commander doesn't kill – it's the children to kill. And when you kill, that's when they tell you, “Uh huh, you've killed, you see, so you have nowhere to go.” And especially when they are abducting you, they make you to kill your brothers or your parents, whatever they see you with, or the relative, or the family of village members. So they said, “Oh Ricky, you see, you are not going to escape because you've killed your own family members, you've killed your village members, and now you have nowhere to go. They will hate you. So you have to remain with us here.” So that's what how they indoctrinate the children in their system. And I think that's why the trauma comes most to the children. Because if the children were to do it, the commanders don't do it, so it's the children. And they get the trauma a lot because of killing, beating, doing their … fighting. They're the one taken to the battlefield, and in many cases, they are used as [a] seal for the bullet not to touch them because they are far away, and they leave the children to fight. [Joseph] Kony himself, when you meet him, you can’t believe that is the one doing all this what he’s doing. He looks polite. He likes telling stories a lot. He tells you how he lives, where he lived, and he lived in – he told us he lived in Lira Palwo [Uganda], and all this kind of stories. He liked children around him all the time. But there comes a time when he's possessed with the spirits. He could tell the commanders, that, “Okay, well, now civilians are doing this to us, and we are not going to spare them. So go and kill any civilian you have seen.” So after thirty minutes he could say, “No, no, no, no, I don't want any killing. Nobody should get killed.” But when the commanders had already left and we had no communication system, so you keep killing until you go back to him. So there was that gap of communication which created a lot of problems and atrocities. We are right now in northern Uganda where the war has been going on for the last twenty-two years. Two million people have been forced to leave their homes and live in refugees camp. An estimated number of 500,000 people have been killed, and 25,000 children have been abducted and to go and work as child soldiers doing a lot of atrocities in the same community they have been home. When a child is abducted from his village to go into the bush, basically the boys are used as fighters, and the girls are turn out to be wives to the commander. But at one point all of them are used as carriers for the loads, for the sick, for the wounded, and as cook for the commanders.That's what they use. And at one point depend, when the longer you stay, the more you are faced with the war directly where they take you to fight on regular basis. But at first when you have just been abducted, you are used to carry loads, carry sick people, carry the wounded people, and cook food, prepare food for the commanders. As they train you, you keep going on through training and all doing all the atrocities and the indoctrination until just a time when they know that you have the courage now, that's when you go directly to fighting. And there was one thing I wanted to mention now is that the war in northern Uganda, which has taken twenty-two years, is the most unique war around the world. This war has never been fought in any part of the world. Why am I saying this? When we look around the world like what happened in Rwanda, it's different community fighting different communities. What happened in Liberia, it’s different communities fighting different communities. But in northern Uganda it's the same community fighting themselves. That makes the war so unique. How do they fight themselves is hard to explain. When assuming they abduct a child from this family, if the child was made to kill the parents, kill the brothers, kill the sisters. So if any of them is killed, assuming you killing your sister, then the rest of the family members will turn against you now. At war this is our enemy, he killed my daughter, he killed my sister, he killed my brother. So it's the same community. You will have problems at personal, family, and community level. So it has made a lot of conflicts among the community. When the boys and girls are abducted, the girls are used as sex slaves by the commanders, and the boys are used to commit atrocities in the community. What I realized, I noticed from the bush, is that when someone begin have the urge of killing all the time – “Oh I need to kill, I need to kill” – he talks about killing all the times, and he's involved, you see, on a daily basis, is killing, is doing a lot of atrocities in the community…I noticed that that person will not last long. Either he's going to die in the next two, three days, or one week. It has happened to a lot of kids and a lot of commanders I saw in the bush. When you are forced to kill someone, when someone tells you, “Oh, if you don't kill him, I will kill you,” what happened first of all you look around and look at your security, that's what happened. Then you decide – they all happen so quick. You decide, should I do this or I don't? Is there a way I can escape it? Can I escape doing this? Then you look around, if you see when you don't have any way to escape, then you have to do it, because if not you will die. And you also value your life. Do I want to die now, or I don't want to die now. So that's what's happening to your head. That's what you think about. What I did when I was in the bush is that I made sure that I couldn't kill any person [that] I could see directly that I'm killing someone. I could not do that; I could dodge it. When we were told – when they give us someone to kill, like “Hey, kill this person,” then I could move as if I'm doing it, but I make the children – I could be like at the back of it, I never wanted to do that myself. And that's what helped me. It's a theory, I think, or a thinking I developed when I was in the bush. When I realized that those who could have the heart of killing all the time, they die soon, then I thought to myself, I prayed to God, I said, “God, I think you shouldn't make me kill anybody when I'm seeing. And with that I will remain, I will leave, I will escape, I will go back home, and I will do all this.” So I made sure that I didn't kill anybody. I didn’t participate on the beating, which is to death, to killing. I participated in beating people as a punishment, which they give me to beat and do that kind of things. But for the killing, no. I made sure that I didn't rape any girl, and I made sure that I didn't raid anything off anybody. That way I thought it would help me out, and that's why I managed to come out without any gunshot, not even a scratch, and I fought a lot of battles. I don't know how I managed to come out of this if I can imagine now. I went through sprayed bullets and through gun ship, which could send dense smoke so it could be seen for many miles away bombing us, and I managed to escape these. I feel it's a miracle, I can believe that. What happened is I come from a Christian background, and I was going to a Christian school, so when I went to the bush, before, I was like any other child. I didn't have that heart of helping the people. It has never crossed my mind. I was just a child and that's all. But my experience in the bush started cultivating any thought for children in my life. I started seeing things different, and whenever I could see people suffering I could say, “Oh God, I think I wish I could help.”  And those I help, and those who I could, I think I helped them. I thought, “No, these people are not doing the right thing.” That's how it started. I felt that, no, we need to do something about this. I need to do something about it. What happened to me in the bush, like carrying a gun, I can't do it now. And what I went through in the bush is difficult. Life there is like carrying an egg. You know when you carry an egg in your thumb [gestures to hand], anytime you just stand like this, and it's off and you lose it and you never gain it. That's how life is in the bush. I went through a lot of fighting. I fought many battles, a thousand battles, I think, in the bush. And I went through sprayed bullets. I went through a lot of fighting. I went through gun ship where it could pass through dense smoke which can be seen from far away. We were shot at with gun ship and all that kind of things. I didn't get hurt. My belief is if I don't do anything on any human being, then nobody could do anything on me as well. That's why I came out without any bullet wound, without a scratch. I used to believe in that a lot. I couldn't think of raping, killing, and whatever they do I could see as if they're not doing the right thing, and I could caution even other failed children. Like one time I sat a child down and I told him, “Please, you know what? These people have been killing, you see.” I gave them example, this one was doing this and this, was doing a lot of killing and is no more, and this and that kind of things. So some…the boy was kind of understanding, but I think at times [shakes his head no]. Then we had some conversation with other children, like when I ask him that as I wanted to escape. I knew that at one point I need to leave if I get the chance, so I could not put on their hat. You know when you keep on putting on a hat for a long time, it makes a mark here [gestures around top of head]. So when you come back home they will know that, oh, this is a soldier. So I never wanted to do that, to make any mark. Then carrying a gun here [gestures over shoulder], if you carry for a long time will make a mark here. I avoided that. Then putting on gun boots. When you keep on putting it every day, it makes a mark around the leg [gestures to leg], so I never used to do that because I knew when I escape, and someone sees that will know that, oh, this has been a soldier, and it would bring problems to me. And that's what I could tell, even these other children, that “Please, avoid doing that because you know, at one point, we know we will get a chance of escaping.” And some could tell me, “Oh, Ricky, no, for me I don't want to escape. That's why I've started putting on the things, you know, because I killed my parents and I'm not going anywhere, I don't have where to go. Oh, they made me to kill one of the village members, so I'm not escaping. I'm staying here now. This is my home.” That's what they could tell me. Some would tell me, “Yes, Ricky, I think I understand, and at one point I know we will do it if God willing.” Then when I was departing with my good friend, he was transferred to the next group. We shook each other's hand. Then he told in parables that whoever will go back to the baby soul first, go and greet them. Which he meant that if you go home first, go and greet them. Or if I go first, I will tell them you are still alive. So that's the kind of experience they know. My brother came back first from the bush. Then when he escaped, I think he was too traumatized. First he couldn't cope up with the experience he got. In that one time he was made to carry a wounded soldier on his back when he was still fresh bleeding, and he died on his back. Then I think seeing our parents being burned down alive and the kind of atrocities he went through, he was forced to kill a lot of people. Then I think he couldn't stay with that, and he committed suicide when he came back. That's the report I got from the village. I didn't see him, though; I saw him last when we were still in the bush. I dedicate my work to my parents who died because of me. They had all the opportunities to run away and leave me with the rebels, then they said no. I think in their mind I was so special to them.... I think what happened is that I started realizing myself and my role when I was abducted, when I saw a lot of atrocities being done. At one point I never accepted it, that that's the right thing to do. And at one point I never accepted it – this is where I'm supposed to be, this is where I belong, and this is the right thing to do. I knew it clearly that all of what they were doing was wrong, but I didn't have the power by then to stop them. But at one point, as I got integrated into the system, I got a lot of problems with my thinking, my different thinking about what they're doing. They felt I was disrespectful, and all the time I was in jail, they removed my shirt, they don't give me the gun. I sleep under the cold without any blanket, without anything to cover me. At one point, my friend tipped me that they wanted to kill me, so when I got a chance of getting a gun, I did not release that gun at all. I saved many people from the bush because I could move in front while I was in abduction, and whenever I see you I could tip you, “Hey, please come here, run away. I have this group, big group, coming. When they see you, they will kill you.” Then my brother also at one point brought a wrong report, and he was supposed to be killed. So they brought him. There were a few – we were a few group with one of the commander, who was insisting that he was supposed to be killed. So I crossed a line [gestures as if to draw a line in the sand], I said, “My brother, come this way. [and then, to commander:] If you want to kill him, cross here.” I opened the ship. And I think they saw from my expression that I was annoyed, and I was ready to kill. Then they left him. Then I told you a story of how I saved this boy whom I was supposed to beat or kill because he threw away the bag. And all that. And what I could see could create a new faculty for children in my life. I keep thinking about these children; I keep thinking about the suffering, how best if I could help. So when I came back, I got the chance that I went out of the war zone completed; I was in Central. And I got the chance of going back to school. When I finished, I got a job, but I wasn't satisfied. In my mind something was telling me, no, go and help these children. They need your help. So I have to move from the Central and came and live in the Internally Displaced Persons camp, and started helping the children. When I finished my college school I was lucky. I got a job, a good job, with the government of Uganda with Minister of Education and Sports in Kampala in Central Uganda where it is very peaceful. And I would get good money, but I left the job. I felt I wasn't satisfied with the job. I felt I need to go back and help my people. And I came back to live in the refugees camp, helping children, former abductees who could come back from the bush, and give them support so that they become rehabilitated; they become another child altogether. Like any other person, most children or most people when they finish school and they get good job, before even getting good job, most people want to move to the city where they feel their soft life. They want to lead that kind of luxurious life. But to me, I'm not satisfied with that. My satisfaction is not about the best – about to be known of the best car I'm driving, or about the riches or physical riches, how many land titles are in my name, no. I feel more satisfied when I serve people. As the saying goes, if someone see a child dying along the road and kneel down to help that child, he stands more taller than someone who stands and watch that child dying. So I go by that principle. What drives me most is seeing former child soldiers getting rehabilitated. I feel very happy; I feel very satisfied. And many times when I see the hopeless children who have come back from the bush, they were about to die, and the abduction – they came back, I rehabilitated them. They are very happy people now. I feel more happy about that. And whenever I see them succeed in life I feel very, very much satisfied. I feel so happy. As I always put it that as a child born out of trouble, the trouble came as a result of a human being doing a lot of atrocities in me when I was young. They abducted me; they forced me to do a lot of things I never wanted to do. They made me pass through sprayed bullets, through bombs from the gun ship, which could produce dense smoke which could be seen from many miles away. They made me to sleep under the cold. They made me to stand guard them while they're raping young girls. They made me to see people being killed, which I never wanted to do that. But that – that does not put me off because it's the same human being that helped me when I came out from abduction. Though I was living in this village as a slave as well, I could dig in return for food. If I don't dig, nobody give me food. But still that inspire me because if they didn't give me food, I would have died anyway, you see. If my second mom didn't help me…they're all human beings. I wouldn't be there. So I felt that, yeah, I think human beings are good people, and I need to help them; I need to be with them. So it gives me more love for human being when I think positively, you see. And I always keep thinking positively about human beings. Despite everything I saw. I said maybe those are the wrong elements, but human being needs to be helped, you see. And that's what I believe in. I still believe in human being. They're very important to me. I love them and I feel… It's that's what I believe in – I'll keep helping human beings. The war in northern Uganda has been going on for the last twenty-two years, and the war is being fought by two parties: the government first, and the Lord's Resistance Army. The Lord's Resistance Army want to overtake the government of Uganda. They have mistrust in the government. The government also doesn't want to leave, so they went into war. And it kept on and on until twenty-two years from now it has been going on. The government of Uganda. . . the Lord's Resistance Army started reinforcing its troop by abducting children from the villages to go and fight the war. And the government, on its part, decided to put people in the IDP camps so that they're protected from abduction. That made the rebel to do a lot of atrocities at home in the villages like they burned them down, and they set land mines in all the strategic places they think people could come back and… like a path, water places, under the trees, the fruits, in the churches, schools, and all that. If people come back, they would get blown up by these land mines. As the two parties fight, the government and the Lord's Resistance Army, it’s the civilian who are caught up in the crossfire, you see, between the two warring parties. So as the saying goes, that if two elephant fights, it is the grass who would suffer the most. So I think it's the civilian who has suffered the most in this war. I think my background has inspired me a lot to do what I'm doing.  And I dedicate all the work I'm doing to my family, who are not there now and cannot see what I'm doing physically. But I believe that somewhere, wherever they are, they are seeing what I'm doing, and they're happy about what I'm doing. That's what I presume. And I believe that this is the only way I can pay them back. I know I owe them a lot. They died because of me, and if I became a wasted human being, in a sense that I couldn't help anybody, then I think there was no meaning for them to die because of me. They died. They thought I was so important to them. And maybe in their mind they thought that I would be very important to the community. That's how I feel that my background has really motivated me and has inspired me to do what I'm doing right now. And I feel happy about what I'm doing. I get a lot of satisfaction in what I'm doing. The sad part is that they miss it physically. They will never see it again. But still I believe that wherever they are they would recommend that I'm doing the right job, and they wouldn't be ashamed of me. I think they would walk with their head up, very happy for what I'm doing. Out of the horrible things which I've gone through, I've created a very beautiful thing for the community. And I will live with that. Many times I tell people that, when I die, I shouldn't be recognized as a hero, but I should be recognized as a servant who has dedicated himself for them.       I know in the process of serving my community I went through a lot of things as well, as I told you. At one point I headed into an ambush, and I was shot at in the waist, but that has not derailed me from what I'm doing. I never thought in my mind that, “Oh, Ricky, your life is at risk because you're working refugees camp, you're in the battlefield, and maybe one time you will die.” I never thought of that, though. Instead, I feel that my personal life is not important in the cause. But what is important is seeing that people, especially the child soldiers come out of what they have gone through, their help. Because human beings have to die anyway, but the cause have to continue, and that's what I believe in. And that's what drives me.  ","Anywar was abducted in 1988 at age 14 to serve as a child soldier in the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Led by Joseph Kony, the LRA was fighting to overthrow Uganda’s secular government. The war in northern Uganda lasted from 1986 until 2006, during which time more than 35,000 boys and girls were enslaved by the LRA. In 1999, Ricky and his friends started Friends of Orphans (FRO), an organization which works to contribute to the empowerment, rehabilitation and reintegration of former child soldiers, abuductees, child mothers, orphans, and to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS."
Arvind,2004 (Narrative date),Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"My name is Arvind. I am ten years old. The middleman came and took me from home to the station. He gave my parents 500 rupees [$11]. He told us that they’re going take us and let us study and we were very happy. But after some time they showed us a knife. When they showed us the knife, we were eating our food and we all starting crying. We were on the train and that’s when Ratnaji came and he took us off the train and took us to the police station. They saved our lives. We were very happy. I like it very much over here. We get to study, we do a few light chores around the place and we get to play. I want to study further but when I get holidays I’ll go back home.I told father that I’ll be good and I won’t fight with anybody, I’ll stay happily over here and study some more. I want to study Hindi and math and I want to become a collector after studying so I can help people who are sick. I’ll sing a few lines of a song. Yama, yama, ya…a, a, a. I feel bad about kids who are sold. It happens only to the people who are poor and need the money. ","Arvind tells the story of a failed attempt at trafficking into the carpet looms of Uttar Pradesh. More than 300,000 children are estimated to be trapped in India’s carpet industry in India, and there are also an estimated 500,000 children in the same industry in Pakistan. Most of India’s carpets are woven in Uttar Pradesh, where the majority of workers are low-caste Hindu boys. Some are lured into bondage by agents’ promises to their parents that they will receive good wages, and others are kidnapped. The boys are forced to work for no pay, for 10-18 hours a day, seven days a week. They are beaten, tortured, branded, kept half fed and half clad, and are usually made to sleep in the loom shed. Cuts and wounds are frequent."
Aulia,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Forced labour,Indonesia (trafficked from) Forced labour,Malaysia (slavery location),"Someone offered me a program to work abroad, in Malaysia. Eventually I was enticed. I will admit frankly that I was enticed by the large sum of money. I left without a passport. I met with an agent in Jakarta. They offered me a passport of a person who resembles me. They said that I didn’t need to undergo medical screening. I didn’t need to do anything, there is already a passport of a person who looks like me. I asked them if this would create problems, and they said no. “You just relax, you will be going overseas.” I was stupid to accept their offer. I am speaking frankly, I am a stupid person. So I went. I departed on the 15th of January at three in the afternoon. There were nine of us who departed. To keep the story short, the other people were already assigned to employers, but I was not, along with two other older workers. Us older workers were then placed at the agent’s house. We were not placed with employers but were sent to a hotel and told to become masseurs. I haven’t even set foot in a hotel before, and now suddenly I was being told to work as a masseur. Who was I going to massage? I was confused. So I said, rather than me becoming a masseur, it would be better if I return to Indonesia. I said that to the agent who was Indonesian. The agent came and told me that I was going to be placed with a friend of his. In fact I again went into the lion’s mouth, the friend turned out to be a pimp. I was placed under the pimp. So—I am embarrassed to tell this story—we were held captive in room guarded by four bodyguards, and we were not allowed to go outside. There were many—excuse me—whores there. At night there was a crowd. Many were smoking, dancing wearing tight clothes, and all of them were Indonesian girls. From what I observed, many came from Cirebon and Indramayu. Because I was the oldest, the pimp entered my room and grabbed my hair while I was praying. He said “You have brought me bad luck.” So I took the initiative to escape at three in the morning. I fled at three o’clock in the morning from the pimp’s house at the Miri district in East Malaysia. I ran to a police station. To cut the story short, I arrived at the station and the police handed me over to immigration. After that I was offered a job. They gave me a choice, be jailed for three months or work. I chose to work, because I did not want to go to jail, I did nothing wrong. So they told me to work. The police escorted me to a bus terminal in east Malaysia, and I was given work selling pastries for four months. Maybe partly because I am old, and was exposed to the sun and rain, I contracted a fever and was ill for three days. I was not given any medication and was not offered anything. Suddenly I was slapped by my employer two times with force. I said, please don’t hit me, I am sick. I am not feigning this. I was then hit again on my body. I got up in my nightgown and pajama pants. I gathered my blanket and he ripped open my bag. He did not open the sipper, but ripped it open. He ripped it open, then pushed me outside. I was really hurt being called a dog. I was very hurt being told that Indonesians are like dogs. I was hurt. I cannot forget it. I was hurt being called a dog. I am a Moslem and I was called a dog, told me that I should eat dirt. This is something that I cannot get out of my ears, I still hear it. I was very insulted. Wherever I am, I am very angry with my agent. I was very hurt, being thrown away with my torn bag, with all my clothes in a mess. ","Aulia is an Indonesian woman who was enslaved in Malaysia. Foreign workers constitute more than 20 percent of the Malaysian workforce and typically migrate voluntarily—often illegally—to Malaysia from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries, often in pursuit of better economic opportunities. However, workers can find themselves imprisoned, exploited, and in debt bondage. The law allows many of the fees of migration, which are first paid by employers, to be deducted from workers’ wages, incentivizing employers to prevent workers from ending their employment before fees are recovered."
Aye,1995 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Thailand (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Japan (slavery location),"After leaving a primary school, I helped my parents do some domestic chores and worked in the paddy field. My friend told me that she was going to work in Japan and persuaded me to go with her. I decided to go with her. But I told my mother I went to work in Bangkok.  When we arrived in Japan, the weather was so cold. An agent chose me and my friend and sent us to Tokyo. Other women were sent to rural areas. The agent told us that each of us owed him 500,000 Thai Baht (US$ 20,000). We were taken to a bar where inside we could see thirty Thai women singing and talking to customers. A man who was in charge of the bar told me to sit with one of the customers who had already paid him 30,000 Yen (US$ 300). After that, he ordered me to go out with that customer.  Many times I saw Yakuza or the Japanese gangsters rush into the bar. One day, three of Yakuza came in and took three Thai women out. The women returned to the bar with tears. One woman had had her throat tickled with a knife and was forced to have oral sex. Another woman was forced to get into the bathtub, and then the man urinated on her face. Sometimes, while I was staying with a customer in a room, I heard my colleague screaming for help in Thai from a room near by. But my customer forbade me to do anything about it or I myself would receive the same awful treatment.  There were some women who ran away. The boss paid Yakuza to trace them and return them for punishment. They locked the woman up in a small room in which she had to sleep with any customers they commanded. If she disobeyed, she would have only one choice-death. Since arriving to work in Japan, I cried a lot although normally I did not cry easily.  One day when we were walking, two policemen came to hold our arms and asked us to show them our passports. We told them that we left them in our room but in fact, our visas had expired a long time ago. We were taken to a police station. There were about 200 women inside and we were investigated. Most of the Thai women had been there for two or three months. They said that they couldn't afford any air tickets so they were waiting for help from the Thai Embassy. One morning, the immigration policeman called our names telling us that we could go back home. I was so delighted but when I saw many of my fellow countrywomen who were not called crying, I felt sympathy for them but couldn't provide any help.  I was deported. After working in these conditions I arrived in Thailand empty handed. All my work, my traumatic experience, was for nothing. At present I stay with my parents and my little nephews in my village. I make my living from a small grocery and do some agriculture. All of this work requires labor, endurance and some capital. But everyone of us who was born in this world has to struggle and work hard in order to live in this world. I also give my time working on the committee for the women's group in my village. Though it is just a small thing, I hope it can be useful for the community. ","Aye grew up in rural Thailand but was trafficked to Japan to work in a Tokyo bar with other Thai women who were forced to entertain and have sex with customers. She was told she owed a large debt to the traffickers and the women were not free to leave. Aye managed to escape only after being arrested by police for violating visa restrictions and deported home to Thailand, where she returned to rural life. Thailand is not only a source of men, women and children who are taken into slavery in other countries, but also functions as a transit and destination for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Four key sectors of the Thai economy (fishing, construction, commercial agriculture, and domestic work) rely heavily on undocumented Burmese migrants, including children, as cheap and exploitable laborers."
Bahar,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Moldova (trafficked from),Turkey (slavery location),"I live with my mother. I never knew my father. We make handiwork for money and live in a small village outside Comrat with other Romas. It is very hard for us because we do not have a man in our home, and every winter we do not have enough food to eat or wood for heating. In 2003, Turk men came to our community and told many girls they can work in a hotel in Istanbul for $500 per month, but we must go next week to get the jobs. They said they will pay for our passport and transportation. I went for this job with five other girls. I thought: “I will make so much money that my mother will never be cold in the winter again.” They took our picture for the passport and gave us a visa. We went by mini-bus and ferry to Turkey. It was no problem to cross the border. In Istanbul we were taken to an apartment. These men left us there and said other men will take us to the hotel. They did not leave us any food for four hours. The other men came late that night when we were asleep. They gave us food and alcohol, and then they raped us. One girl shouted, and they whipped her on the back with leather belts. They said if we want to live we must have sex with any man who comes to this apartment. If we do not, they said they will kill our families in Comrat. They took three girls from the apartment and left me and two others. Many Turkish men came everyday for sex. They didn’t care about having sex with all three of us at once in the same room. After a few weeks, one of the girls bit a client who was hurting her. The client beat her very badly and broke her jaw. The pimps took her from the apartment, and a few days later another girl came. She was very young. She was also from my village in Moldova. There was no electricity or phone in the room, and no windows. I think one man was always in the apartment next to us, and if we made too much noise, he threatened to beat us. Sometimes the police came and had sex with us. Sometimes the men who first brought me to Istanbul came for sex. After one year, the men from the apartment sent me home. I saw my mother and burst into tears. I tried to lie to her that I had done cleaning work in a hotel, but I could not. She asked why I had never written to her, and I told her the truth. She told the police, but they could do nothing. Those men had left long ago from Comrat, but they took 30 girls from our village in one year since I was gone.","Bahar was born in Moldova and trafficked into sex slavery in Turkey. Moldova is a country origin for the trafficking of women and children into European sex slavery. Its economic conditions fuel this trafficking. In 2000, the country’s GDP was 40 percent of its level in 1990. Unemployment remains high, especially among women. People are forced to look outside of the country for work and pimps take advantage: some victims are kidnapped but more often they answer job advertisements promising work and then are forced into sex slavery. Most Moldovan trafficking victims are taken to the Balkan countries, though other destinations include Asia, Turkey, Western Europe and the Middle East."
Battis,2005 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was beaten at my school by the teacher and decided not go school again. I was so happy when I left the school but today I am facing a problem. If I had not left the school I would not be in child labor and separated from my family. I was brought two years back by the broker, name not known to me. Before coming to the loom I was working as a daily wage labor. I was getting 10-20 rupees [$0.20-0.45] per day in the field. The poor condition of the family compelled me to work from early childhood. The broker gave 1000 rupees [$20] to my father and took me with him as a product in his carry bag. He assured my father that I would be getting proper education and small work to earn my daily bread. Being unfamiliar about the coming situation, my father sent me along with him and seeing the miserable economic condition of my family, I also did not refuse to go. When we were on the way the broker did not gave me any thing to eat, rats were jumping inside my stomach but what can be done to prevent them from jumping? From the moment I stepped inside the loom I was made to knit the carpet. I was supposed to knit three square feet of carpet daily with my small fingers and if I failed to do so, I was beaten with sticks and iron rod. I had to work ten to 14 hours daily with a break of one hour in the morning and was not allowed to go outside. I was not even allowed to talk with my parent on a phone line. One day my father made a phone call and my owner told him: “Battis has gone somewhere.” It was very irritating to me. My friends told me that the owner does this with every child. I never got sufficient food to eat. I always felt hungry. The quality of food was also not good—dal full of water and rice, sometimes we used to get puffed rice to eat. While doing work, whenever I felt hunger I use to think of my home where I was free to eat anything anytime. I tried to escape from the trap of the owner and I succeeded but unfortunately I was caught at a place nearly 25 kilometers from the loom. I felt bad about my condition before the rescue operation but am now feeling happy. I will open a tailoring shop and stitch clothes for my villagers. They will give me money and I will definitely not come into bondage again. I will set up an example for my friends and children of the village and prevent them from getting into the trap of bondage.","Battis was enslaved in a carpet loom in Uttar Pradesh. He was liberated by activists from Bal Vikas Ashram (BVA), an organization that liberates and rehabilitates child slaves. He was found weaving carpets, wearing only underwear, and had been forced to weave rugs for 12-15 hours a day, beginning at 6am. From BVA he received medical care, counseling, literacy training, and basic rights education.

Bin,2005 (Narrative date) ,Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I was kept in a gloomy prison cell, about 30 square meters, with over 30 people locked inside. When I was first imprisoned in this cell, I could smell all kinds of foul odors from feces, urine, mold, rotten flesh and materials. After a few months, I could no longer smell anything. The smells permeated everything in the cell all day, and I had gotten accustomed to them. Occasionally, it would be so quiet in the cell that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone took advantage of this brief silence to ponder over his past. Day after day, quite a few people were getting closer and closer to execution day. During the years of 2000 and 2001, following orders given by Jiang Zemin and Luo Gan, the National Security Division of the Beijing Police Department had arrested a large group of high-ranking intellectuals who practiced Falun Gong, including professors, people with Ph.D. and Master’s degrees. They were detained in the Beijing Police Department until they accepted the education of the “Party and people.” This was proclaimed to the outside world as being done gently as “a breeze and rainfall in spring.” I was one of them. The prison cell had two doors, the front and the back. The front door was a thick iron door and an iron fence. The iron door was about one inch thick and the fence was made of iron poles, as wide as an adult’s thumb. The back door was also an iron door, as big as the front door. The front door was an entrance-exit where prisoners were escorted in and out, or dragged out for execution. Ten armed-policemen guarded the door against potential runaways. Every time the front door was opened, it could mean someone was going to die soon. Once, a criminal secretly sharpened the handle of a toothbrush. He poked a policeman’s neck with the sharp toothbrush in an attempt to use him as a hostage to gain his release. However, hostages mean nothing to the communist party and without giving it a second thought, another policeman immediately shot the prisoner to death. The policeman who was held as hostage was terrified to death. Since this incident, the prisoners detained at the No.1 Detention Center of the Beijing Police Department are given only the brush end of the toothbrush, the handle end is cut off. The “Wind Cage” is connected to the back door of the cell. It was square-shaped and about ten square meters (about 108 square feet) in size. All four sides of the wind cage were thick concrete walls. The top was flat and made of big iron pipes, on which policemen could stand in a line. The police standing on the top of the cage could open the back door to let prisoners out for fresh air and sunshine. The wind cage wasn’t even opened once a week. “Open the wind cage!” the loud shout came from a policeman standing on the top. It broke into my thinking and the temporary quiet of the cell. The pale, unkempt prisoners started to show a hint of happiness on their faces. One by one, prisoners walked outside of the back door. They nodded and bowed to show their gratitude to the policeman on the top of the wind cage. Then they quickly occupied a place with more sunlight. The first time I was let out, I was shocked by what I saw. After they secured a place, the first thing the prisoners did was get naked. The scabies, sores and psoriasis on their bodies were fully exposed. I was not too surprised by this. What truly shocked me was that many people quickly flipped their genital organs up into the sunlight. Then, they kept flipping them back and forth. It was such a strange scene. If they were not sentenced to death, the criminals surviving the detention center would be sent to prisons to complete their sentence and do slave labor. At the same time, they brought sexually transmitted diseases with them to the prisons. There, they are an absolutely cheap work force. An amazing number of products made in China are produced in prisons and forced labor camps. In May 2002, I was sent to the Beijing Repatriation Division of Provincial Criminals with several others and Shao Ping. Shao Ping earned his Master’s degree from the Chinese Academy of Science. In the repatriation division, we were waiting to be repatriated to other formal prisons to serve a sentence. From this experience we gained a real understanding of the forced labor in prisons. The strict management system, frequent insults, and degrading treatment were meant to cause fear and mental trauma in the prisoners. The prisoners were expected to labor tirelessly. To labor for 15 or 16 hours a day was routine. If a prisoner had trouble finishing the assigned work, he was punished by having to “sing until the dawn” (that is, he had to work around the clock without sleep). Since the cells were more than full, the prisoners had no time to take care of personal hygiene. They counted the days, with their diseases worsening day by day. I was arrested for my belief. I had committed no crimes. Nor was I a criminal. I simply considered myself a “correspondent” sent there to seriously observe what was happening around me. I hoped that one day my observations would enable the world to have a better understanding of what is going on in Chinese prisons. Various jobs of manual labor involved packing women’s underwear, making copies of audio and video materials, attaching trademarks to various products, processing books, binding books, and making for export fishing floats, colored Christmas bulbs, and accessories. I participated in all of the manual labor and had a good understanding of each working procedure. During one hot summer, the prison authorities ordered us to make packages for Gracewell underwear. It was really hot and the prisoners hadn’t showered for a very long time. They scratched all over their bodies, while being engaged in manual labor. Some of the prisoners scratched their private parts every now and again. When they took out their hands, I saw blood on their fingernails. I was not sure if women would really look graceful in that underwear. Another time, the prisoners processed a kind of packaged food called “Orchid Beans” for self-employed people. This snack was made from broad beans. Self-employed people kept trucking broad beans into the prison. In the prison there were barrels in which the broad beans were soaked in water until they were swollen. To spare themselves some trouble when changing water in the barrels, sometimes the prisoners would dump a whole barrel of beans into a dirty urinal and then pour water into the barrel putting the beans inside. When the beans became swollen in water, the prisoners would start to peel the beans. In front of everyone there was a set of parallel knives. One picked up a bean, rolling it over the knife and removing the bean skin on either side leaving a “golden belt” in the middle. In this way beans look good, though dirty and muddy. Then, the last step was to throw beans back into the basket. At least 10,000 beans had to be peeled in one day to meet the government’s quota. The prisoners bustled around peeling the beans, with their snot and sputum mixed with beans. Then the processed beans were put into a big bag to be taken to the stores of the self-employed people where they would be fried. The fried broad beans looked golden and shiny. The self-employed people packed them in beautiful packages and sold them to customers. The broad beans are in demand in the market and thus of high profit to sellers. Consumers enjoy the beans. In a US supermarket, I saw fried broad beans imported from China. I wondered if our prison had made its contribution to those beans. Annually, a large number of Christmas items and clothing for western countries are made in Chinese prisons. Once the prison in which I had been detained was assigned to make light bulbs. Every day prisoners were supposed to tie copper wires tightly around a plastic tank in a fixed shape and then connect all the light bulbs together. The prisoners’ hands were usually bleeding. Needless to say, their diseased skin and sexually transmitted diseases were left on the light bulbs. Once the prison I was in made strings of beads as accessories. The prisoners used needles and thread to string colored beads and then connected the two ends to make a string of beads. The strings of beads looked beautiful. But, I hope that children will not put them in their mouths and women won’t put them around their necks.","Unknown numbers of people have been held as slave laborers in China’s “Laogai” (labor reform camps). Since 1999, the Chinese Communist party has executed a campaign of persecution against the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, which is seen as a “threat to social and political stability.” Practitioners have reported being detained and mistreated while in detention, including torture and forced labour. Human rights organizations claim that Falon Gong practitioners are often targeted for arrest, along with ethnic minorities, Catholics, Protestants, and Tibetans. Bin, a journalist for a newspaper that reported on Falun Gong, spent two years in the Laogai. It is estimated that 0.25% of the population of China are living in modern slavery. According to the Global Slavery Index, “China still faces an enormous issue with the trafficking of women and children for forced marriage and the sex trade, both internally and on a transnational level as criminal gangs become more sophisticated.”"
Carina,2015 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Haiti (trafficked from),Haiti (slavery location),"My name is Carina Louis. I am eleven years old. I live in Carrefour-Sainte, a small town of Mont Ramier. My mom has a serious psychological problem. Often she loses touch with us, her children, and the community. Sometimes she has a disoriented sense of her surroundings, and an inability to control her actions. You could say she has a mental disorder. I am the third in a family of five children. Magalie is a friend of my family and she knows the economic and social reality of my family. Because she knows everything about me, she decided to ask my family to let me go with her to Port au Prince to help me. However, despite the fact that I was just a little girl that did not stop her from making me responsible for doing difficult work at home such as cleaning the dishes, fetching water, and throwing away rubbish. I slept on the floor on a scrap of cloth. I was given things to eat, but I was malnourished because I was not eating well, and it was the only way for me to survive. I was far away from my family and when I did not want to do something, they threatened they would send me back to my mother. When they threatened this, I had a really bad feeling, because I also knew that there were still problems with my mother. Even though I was the one to fetch water to the house, I did not even have access to this water to take my own bath. Going to school was only a dream, because I had no access to school like all the other children of the house. The lady and her children would hit me whenever they wanted. They often told me I was the daughter of a crazy woman and that hurt me. One day my grandmother came to retrieve me. That day, I was so happy, I even cried with joy. It was like rain during the dry season for me. When I asked my grandmother why she came for me, she replied that she received training on children’s rights through [the child rights module] introduced by FTS frontline partner, Limye Lavi. I thank the people who took the initiative to set up this training on children’s rights to make our parents know and respect our rights. Thank you for the light you have brought into the community. When I'm a big girl I'd love to be a nurse to help bring my health care skills to the community and help my family to live better.","Carina, like many other children in Haiti, became a Restavèk worker. Restavèk is a traditional system in which Haitian children from homes suffering economic and social difficulties are sent by parents to live with other families and work for them as domestic servants. There is a perception that the child will be enrolled in school by the host household and treated like one of the family, but often the reality is completely different. For many children, the day is filled with work. As Carina describes, even the youngest are expected to fetch heavy buckets of water, hand-wash clothes, carry loads to and from the marketplace, and work in the fields—often laboring for 14 hours a day for no pay. Carina’s story suggests that a model of community education and resistance against the Restavèk system has been effective at freeing children and returning them home."
Carissa,2013 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I hold a joint Juris Doctorate and MBA from UCLA, I pursued my degrees based on an interest I had in community economic development. In 2007, I was on a path to working in the financial industry, when I learned that children were being arrested and charged with prostitution and solicitation in Los Angeles County. Having survived trafficking at the age of twelve, I knew, from my own experience, that each time victims were stopped by police or treated like criminals; they were pushed closer to their trafficker. Whether victims were being questioned, booked, or even released on the spot, the failure to protect a child from their trafficker is where the harm was being done -­‐-­‐-­‐ not only to the child, but also to our communities. I felt a sense of urgency to speak out, and search for ways to end this re-­‐victimization of youth, not only in Southern California, but across the country. Between 2007 and present, I have brought the issue of arresting victims to community groups, social services, nonprofit organizations, media outlets, educators, doctors, lawyers, police, elected officials, rotaries, foundations, business leaders, and most recently to bus drivers and janitors on behalf of San Joaquin County Office of Education. In 2011, at the request of the State Department, I traveled overseas to share my message with countries searching for ways to address human trafficking in all of its forms. In 2012, I published a memoir, Runaway Girl: Escaping Life on the Streets One Helping Hand at a Time. In an effort to increase penalties for traffickers, I also became an outspoken supporter for Proposition 35. In 2012, I returned to my interest in finance and community economic development, by founding Runaway Girl, FPC a California Flexible Purpose Corporation that offers survivors a chance to create and sustain their own initiatives. Runaway Girl, FPC offers survivor facilitated trainings in Human Trafficking. Our 1-­‐Day training is an effort to reach out to wide community groups, who wish to build a Community Protocol for Response [CPR] to human trafficking. Our 2-­‐Day Empowerment Model Training [EMT] is an opportunity for those who work more closely with victims and survivors of trafficking to develop empowerment models, within their organizations. In addition to building a sustainable pipeline of survivor leaders, Runaway Girl, FPC also offers career development opportunities to survivors of human trafficking. Runaway Girl, FPC supports survivor led initiatives and businesses by compensating survivors, who give their time and resources to the issues of human trafficking. Runaway Girl also promotes businesses led by survivors, such as Neet's Sweets, a Charlotte, NC based baking business founded by Antonia ""Neet"" Childs, a social entrepreneur and survivor of human trafficking. We must create clear mandates for local governments, near and far, by strengthening and enforcing legislation that protects victims of human trafficking. Slavery in the United States was abolished; however, nearly 150 years later, human trafficking in its many forms persists and is widespread. Under section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress enacted a statute by which it prohibited anyone from “holding, arresting, or returning, or causing or aiding in the arresting or returning, of a person to involuntary servitude.” The business of human trafficking enjoys protections from local governments that criminalize and fail to protect victims of human trafficking. By arresting or not assisting someone who has been victimized, we are in effect ""causing or aiding in the ... returning of a person to involuntary servitude."" The failure to protect and mistreatment of victims of human trafficking continues to be the biggest challenge to ending all forms of modern day slavery. Recommendation #1 When a victim of human trafficking is in contact with any agency that receives federal funding, all actions should be in accord with existing federal legislation. Victims should be offered services and protections. Victims of human trafficking should never be arrested or charged with crimes related to their being trafficked. Arresting victims of sex trafficking violates state and federal law, and has proven to be a highly ineffective approach to ending the demand for sex trafficking. Autumn Burris, a long time leader in the fight against sex trafficking, says ""victims are targeted for arrest, while buyers of exploited individuals oftentimes remain invisible."" Buyers make sex trafficking possible. In order to formulate an effective strategy, buyers need to be held accountable for their role in sex trafficking. In order to deter buyers, penalties must hurt. According to a 2011 study by Dr. Melissa Farley, one hundred percent (100%) of sex buyers said they would be deterred from buying sex if a month jail term were imposed and ninety percent (90%) said they would be deterred if a $1,000-­‐$2,000 penalty were imposed. Recommendation #2 End sex trafficking by arresting and fining buyers, who drive up the demand for commercial sex. As a member of a community of survivors of all forms of human trafficking, my goal in testifying is to offer solutions that are as broad as the picture of modern day slavery. According to the California Department of Justice, “fifty-­‐six percent (56%) of victims who received services through California’s task forces were sex trafficking victims. Labor trafficking is under-­‐reported and under-­‐investigated as compared to sex trafficking. Yet, data from other sources indicate that labor trafficking is 3.5 times as prevalent as sex trafficking worldwide.” Congressman Royce’s proposed legislation H.R. 3344-­‐Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination (FORTE) Act introduced last week proposes protections and remedies for foreign workers in the recruitment process to combat the potential for labor exploitation. I have learned from training alongside Kanthi Salgadu, a member of the CAST [Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking] Survivor Caucus, that there is a great need for education and outreach to potential victims who are recruited by employment agencies to work overseas. Experts like Kanthi, who have survived human trafficking, have earned a seat at the table, and are prepared to lead education and outreach initiatives that will support the FORTE Act. Recommendation #3 Invest in survivors both individually and in groups, and support their global leadership in the fight against human trafficking. Traffickers attempt to keep victims down, and keep them divided. Survivors have shown that they can and will rise above; however, this requires an investment in services and protection. Basic needs must be met, as survivors of trafficking overcome severe emotional, financial, and physical challenges. Creating opportunities for partnership, and uniting survivors in their fight against slavery, also requires planning, action and investment. The result will be survivors leading the way, and a greater understanding of how trafficking happens today. Survivors are the key to developing timely, relevant and appropriate responses to all forms of human trafficking. Empowering survivors to lead in the United States will have a global impact on abolishing human trafficking, as we enjoy the rights, freedom, liberties and protections that allow us to move out of a life of victimization and to a role of leadership.","Carissa Phelps is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the organisation Runaway Girl. She grew up in California and, enduring a troubled home life, dropped out of school when she was 12 and ran away. After meeting a pimp, she was forced into prostitution, and later arrested alongside him. After returning home she was arrested for joyriding and sent to a juvenile detention centre, where she began to receive therapy and an education. She went on to graduate from high school, university and obtain a law degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). A documentary about her story was released in 2008, named Carissa."
Celena,2015 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"I’m going to tell you just a tiny bit about my story. At the age of 19 I was brought to the United States by the man who from there on trafficked me for years. My initiation into this process was being taken to a house, where I was forced to serve initially 30 to 50 men for a long process that lasted weeks. And then I ended up in another state, where they moved me, and this continued. Shortly after this started happening to me, as you can imagine, I was crying constantly. I was not behaving according to how they wanted me to. I was crying. I was sad constantly. I was not performing to how they wanted me to. I felt very ashamed. And I felt this little from what was being forced onto me. So here is my first interaction with the health care industry. They wanted to stop me from crying so that I could perform better so they could make more money. So they took me to a clinic in New York. The doctor walked in, asked me what were my symptoms, and I explained that I felt very anxious and very sad and I felt like I wanted to cry all the time. She asked no more questions and told me that I was depressed and prescribed me medication for depression. The second time I was experiencing a lot of pain from all of the activity that I had to perform every single day. The pain was so excessive that the trafficker finally decided to take me back to the clinic now to remedy this issue. I ended up in the same clinic, with the same nurse, with the same doctor – same people. She walked into the room, asked me what was wrong. I explained that I was experiencing pain. She didn’t examine me, did not ask me any more questions, and gave me painkillers to take the pain away. In 2009 this was the worst episode for me. I began bleeding excessively. And by now I had been bleeding for six months straight nonstop while I was still being trafficked every single day. The trafficker forced me to wear makeup sponges inside my vagina so that this could stop the excessive bleeding that was going on every day so that I could keep working for him. I couldn’t take it anymore, and he finally realized that and took me to the doctor. And he told me to say this. He told me to say that I had no family in the United States, that I didn’t know anyone, and that I had a boyfriend who was very sexually active. And I had been experiencing these bleedings ever since I had started interacting with him. That occasion I was at the hospital from 11:00 in the morning until 4:00 a.m. the next day with several people doing exams and tests on me and looking at my interiors. And no one asked a single question. I was not even prescribed medication. They didn’t provide me any treatment because all I had was excessive bleeding and lacerations. So they said just go home and drink a lot of Gatorade so you can hydrate, and you should not have any sexual activity. I know that I don’t have a lot of time, so I want to thank you. And I’m thanking you mainly because I’m hoping that somehow this will go somewhere else where all of the young girls and the young adults that are going through this could be rescued easier or better or that we find other ways to do this for them. I wish that I could be the person in power to be doing this for the girls. But I also understand that people who are in power, like doctors and police officers and people that may be in this room, are the ones who could possibly make this happen.","Celena is originally from Mexico, but was forced into slavery in the US performing sex work from the age of 19. In the US, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), as amended, prohibits all forms of human trafficking, but there are still an estimated 57,700 people living in slavery within its borders. According to the Global Slavery Index, “The U.S. attracts undocumented workers, migrants, and refugees, who can be at particular risk of vulnerability to human trafficking upon their arrival and during their stay in the U.S. Research undertaken on vulnerable migrant labourer populations in San Diego, California, and in North Carolina suggests that these populations often include undocumented seasonal labourers who experience significant language barriers, cultural non-assimilation, and fear of deportation.” Here Celena discusses how medical services she accessed while in slavery failed to seize opportunities to understand her situation and act appropriately to remove her from those who enslaved her. The US Department of Justice estimates that of the 14,500 and 17,500 foreign-born individuals trafficked into the US annually, some 80 percent are female, and 70 percent of these women end up as sex slaves. Feeder countries include Albania, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico (many from the central region of Tlaxcala, a haven for modern-day slave traders), Nigeria, and Ukraine. Often the women are forced to work to pay off the debts imposed by their smugglers—debts ranging from $40,000 to $60,000 per person. They might perform 4000 acts of sexual intercourse each year to meet their quota, at $10 to $25 per act."
Chantha,2003 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"When I was a little girl I dreamed of going to school, and then finding someone to love, to have a family. That was my dream, when I was a little girl. Then I was forced to become a prostitute, at age 13. My mother died when I was very young. My stepmother was mean, she would beat me and refuse to give me food. So I left my father’s house to find work. When I arrived in the big city, a woman said she can give me a job at her house. I was very happy to have some work and a place to stay. But at this woman’s house, men would come. If I tried to refuse the woman would beat me, or shock me with electricity. And there was always someone watching, so I could not escape. In this house I was one of 15 girls. After two years I convinced the woman to let me go, so I can find my father and stepmother. When I found them, they despised me and told me to leave. For three days and nights I slept in the fields along the road without any food. Hungry and alone I sat near a garden and waited for men to come to me. After several customers I had enough money to get some food and a bus ticket. In the city a man found me and said he had a safe place for me to stay. Then he sold me to another brothel. When I was a prostitute I was required to have 15 men each day. If I did not, I would be beaten and refused food. This is the story of my life. I am now 24 and I am dying from AIDS. One of my greatest fears is that when I die, no one will come to my burial. When I talk to God, I ask him to give me peace. My life has had no significance, no value...I hope that by sharing my story, my life will finally have meaning. And can help prevent others from the deep sadness of my life.","Chantha became a child sex slave in Cambodia at age of 13. Freedom brought no restored sense of self: she observes that her life has “had no significance, no value” (though hopes that it might finally achieve “meaning” through the telling of her story). Instead, freedom brought rejection by her family, prostitution, AIDS, and—six months after she told her story—death from an AIDS-related illness."
Chariya,2003 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"My name is Chariya. I am 12 years and I have seen things that children should never see. When I was seven, my mother died. When she was living she made thatched roofs for people’s houses. She was a wonderful mother. I miss her very much. My father was unable to care for me and my little sister, so my auntie took us. She was not a nice woman. One day she sold me and my little sister to a brothel. I was aged seven. My little sister was aged only four. We were locked in a room where we could not escape. We were forced to watch pornographic movies, to learn what to do. We were forced to watch couples through a hole in the wall. If we refused, they would shock us with an electrical rod. I still have nightmares.","Chariya became a child sex slave in Cambodia at age of seven, trafficked with her four-year-old sister. She was rescued after four years. She notes that the dreams of a “little girl” were over when she entered slavery. Her enslavement continues to cast a long shadow: freedom includes “nightmares.” Despite endemic corruption that contributes to slavery in various sectors in Cambodia, including with vulnerable demographics, the government has done little to investigate, prosecute or convict complicit officials."
Dalyn,2007 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"I was living with my grandfather in Cambodia. As a normal, happy child I did not fear anything. Then, at 12 years old, a woman asked me whether I would like to work at a garment factory. I agreed and went with her. But she sold me to the owner of a brothel in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. I felt betrayed and cheated. I thought I was going to find work. I never thought I was going to be sold like that. There were lots of other boys and girls at the brothel. I overheard two pimps bargaining and heard one of them say my price was $150 (£78). My heart sank and I started asking myself where the hell had I ended up. I saw many couples coming in and out of the rooms. From that moment on, I knew something was seriously wrong. I was frightened and desperately wanted to ask the children what kind of place this was. A group of men came into my room and told me to receive a client. I asked what I was supposed to do. They told me: ""Don't worry, you'll know what to do. And if you don't, you'll do it until you do."" I refused but they told me to shut up and said that ""one way or the other"" I was going to have to do as they say. They dragged me out of the room and I screamed and called out for help. They put a gun to my head. I pleaded for my life, telling them this wasn't the work I had been led to believe I would be doing. But the brothel owner said: ""You didn't follow anyone here. You're here of your own free will. You are a prostitute and you came here looking to work as a prostitute."" I said: ""I'm young and I have my future ahead of me. Please don't make me do something like this."" But then he said I would be shot if I refused. He ordered in a group of men carrying electric cables. I cried and screamed out for help but nobody came. They starved me until I agreed to go with clients. I was locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel for entire days. I was only ever allowed out when a client came. Some clients were considerate and quite kind. Others were not. If I refused to perform particular sex acts, clients would beat me up and report me to the brothel owner. The brothel owner would also beat me and tell the other girls in the brothel to beat me too. The psychological impact was horrendous. It lives with me even to this day. When it finally dawned on me that I was a prostitute, I felt a sense of utter disgust. I had become the very thing I most despised. It is slavery of the worst kind. They have total power over you - they get you to do anything they want. You feel like dirt and there is nothing you can do except follow orders. You could end up dead. I was scared right up until the brothel owner was arrested. Then I realised that we were being rescued. We were rescued by the police and the AFESIP, an organisation whose founder, Somaly Mam, is a former child sex slave and famous figure in Cambodia. I was so relieved and happy. I do not know what the future will bring. I feel it is my obligation to tell everyone that they should do everything they can to prevent themselves and others going through prostitution and all the things I had to go through. By the end of it, you will end up lower then you can ever imagine... in hell.","Dalyn told her story at the age of 17 while living in a shelter. She was enslaved at the age of 12 after a woman made false promises of a job in a garment factory. Instead, she was sold to a brothel and abused physically and psychologically until the brothel owner was arrested and the children rescued by the AFESIP (Agir Pour La Femmes en Situation Précaire, Acting for Women in Precarious Siutations). Like many other survivors, she expresses a desire to tell her story in order to prevent the enslavement of others. Despite endemic corruption that contributes to slavery in various sectors in Cambodia, including with vulnerable demographics, the government has done little to investigate, prosecute or convict complicit officials."
Dara,2007 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Cambodia (trafficked from),Cambodia (slavery location),"I don't know my name exactly. I don't know my birth date. I don't know where I was born. I don't know my parents. I just grew up alone. The people in the village took care of me. They gave me food. Sometime I slept in their house. So I don't have a name. No parents. I don't know nothing about my family. It's too hard for me. I need love and I never have love. When I was sold I was maybe nine, ten, I don't know. I don't know the age exactly. One day an old, old man arrived and he looked at me and he said he's my real father. He said he knows my family. So I think maybe this time I have my family. I agree to come with him. And then they start to treat me very bad. And he start to sell me. When I was around 12, I don't know, he sell me for marriage to another guy, then after he send me to the brothels. I was there in the brothels for more than four years. They hit people and put them in cages. Every day is not easy. I think from my own experience it's not the brothel that make me pain. I think I miss maybe love. I miss my family. I don't know who I am. I'm dead. My life is finished a long time. It's finished. I'm so sad. I'm dead. Okay, I cannot lie, before I have tried to suicide. Right now I'm better for sure because I have children. But it's not easy to survive like this. I don't want to survive like this. I have nothing right now. So I try to make out that everything is beautiful to make me happy. Sometimes my children say to me, ""mommy you look so great and so beautiful."" I am happy. But last month I realize, I'm so tired. I didn't want to even shower. It's made me dead and dead and dead. And I have my friends. They come to me every day. They say to me, ""do you want to die like this? You know, you are so dirty."" You know, in Cambodia you understand that when a woman has no virginity, they have finished their life. And then can you imagine I'm in the brothel. Nobody can love me. I have no future, I have no man who can marry me. And then I feel like my body's very dirty. Everyday I hear the story. Everyday others talk to me about their story. When they talk to me I feel like them. I feel my life too, because of my past. When they say to me, ""the man raped me and I have pain, why they rape me?"" And oh my god, I feel mine because I have survived the same thing. Sometimes I hate men. I think we should educate men and I think that we should ask the woman to educate their children too. We can ask a woman to teach their sons. We should start when they are young, because after it's too late. We all matter. Women matter. Please educate your son. For my organization, I have already the idea when I was in the brothel. They kill my friend in front of my eye. You know, we are all together, I remember that. And then she was very sick. She say to me, I cannot have another client, because I'm so sick. And the pimps just her killed in front of us. ""If one of you refuse a client, I kill you like her."" Everyone cry a lot. Not me. I look at him and, you know, I want to be military, I want to be rich. If I am rich I buy gun and kill him. In my head I just kill. I like my movie, my stupid idea. When you have money you can kill him back. I don't have money. I have my very stupid idea. Later I am a volunteer. They have a teen arrive and she say to me, ""so are you going to help me?"" I said, ""why?"" ""They rape me. So if really you want to help me, please, take me out."" So, that’s my life. My life's finished long time. I just want one thing, if I can help. We take care of others. We have focus and training, then after micro-business when they go back to their family or into society. We can help them to finish school. I had some idea like if volunteers can take one week with the children and play with them, bring them in the seaside. It's great because I want them to get love. Love. I want them to get everything. In the shelter we have nearly two hundred girls. We start at five years old but if they had been forced, even they are 40, we take them. I don't have limit on age.  One girl had been raped by her father when she was nine years old. And then she had been raped by her brother. When her mommy knew, she sent her to her sister’s house. She arrived there and she was raped by the husband of the sister. And when the sister knew she had been raped, she bring her to the brothel. She give the money to the brothel owner to make a punishment. So she had been in a cage for two years. When we help her, she so afraid of everyone. She didn't like red color, anything red, I don't know why. She say like, he's raped me, he hit me, he raped me, he hit me. One time my staff, he was like clothes, red clothes....she said, this one is raped me. All red, you know the red color. She has HIV, AIDS. She's going to die. It's her fault? No.","“Dara” was enslaved for sexual exploitation as a child in Cambodia. Here she discusses her enslavement and the psychological impact that this has had on her, explaining the difficulty of reintegrating into society after her enslavement, and that she feels “finished” and “dead.” She also talks about her work as a volunteer helping other survivors of slavery to train and take control over their lives. Despite significant attempts to curb the commercial sexual exploitation that Cambodia became famous for in the 1990s, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels."
Denise,2002 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"We were very poor, so I would also try to help out by working. My stepfather is in a very pitiful state. He doesn’t have a job. I was sent to live with relatives to help earn money and provide for my own survival. The people I lived with had work. I guess they tried to help, but it’s really different from having your real parents around. They had to take care of two other children. They had other nieces and nephews, aside from me. They had arrived first, so they were prioritized and had to be taken care of first. I was so lonely I really wanted to go home. I was hesitant to run away because I didn’t have any money. I have to wash the dishes before going to school in the morning and also after school. I would have to cook again, then I would have to do more housework. Sometimes I would ask myself, why is mother like this? And she wouldn’t shut up unless you answered back. But I didn’t want to answer back. So I would have to keep on sitting and just listening to her. And I would think, when is she going to stop her talking, it’s so noisy and I wish I could just keep quiet. But sometimes I would lose my temper and then I would answer back. So, sometimes, to avoid answering back to her, I would just leave the house. So I would go to my aunt’s house, since I pitied my mother and wanted to avoid talking back to her. I would seldom answer back, but I would realize how painful it must have been for her. I shouldn’t answer back because I am just a child. But sometimes, she kept going on and on, I would say something very hurtful, so that’s why I would just leave to avoid saying something painful. So I told my aunt I would rather leave than say something distressing to my mother. With regards to my half-brother, I feel that I don’t feel any affection towards him, even though we are related. This is probably because when I was still small, I still needed my mother’s attention, but suddenly my mother got married again and then I had a younger sibling, and my mother couldn’t pay attention to me anymore because all her attention was focused on the younger ones. I still have elder siblings and I want their attention focused on me and not grabbed by the smaller ones. But sometimes the smaller ones still get all the attention. Sometimes we squabble among ourselves, probably because I’m also hardheaded. After being captured and when first allowed to see my mother, I really wanted to go home. My mother was crying, so I told her it’s only now that you are crying for me, when I was still at home, you wouldn’t pay any attention to me. And when I would stay with you because I had missed you, you would ask what I was doing there in your house. You would even ask me what my business/errand was to visit you. You treated me in this way. When you told me that you would send me to school, this did not happen. It was then that my sister told me that they wouldn’t allow me to go to school or to go work. So I looked for a way to look for a job that would allow me to be a working student. I was also getting fed up, I had run out of money and my family even borrowed money from me. I borrowed money so that I could look for a job, but I couldn’t find a job as a working student. I found one but they were looking for a high-school graduate, so it was very difficult. I had a friend who invited me to join a training and I asked her what kind of training, I thought it might be something like karate only. My friend said, not just karate, don’t you want to learn everything? So I said yes, so let’s go to the training together. She said she wanted to go to the mountains. So I asked her will we become part of the armed group? She said yes. So I said, I don’t want to go, we might die there. She assured me, they still have to train us. Our situation here isn’t getting better, we can’t go to school and we can’t find a job. When we want to go somewhere, we can’t because we don’t have any money. And when we do get to go somewhere, when we get home we get scolded so much. So that’s why I was convinced by her explanation. So I said, Why don’t we go right away today? So that afternoon we went. So I made up a story for my mother, just a make believe story so I could go. I told her that I found a job in Binay-binay. I even made a sketch of where I was supposed to work. It was just a fake sketch. I just did that so I could get away, even if it was wrong. I felt sorry to leave my mother, but my mother was so poor. I couldn’t bear it anymore, just suffering there. For me, I was looking for a way to let off steam and have a chance to be happy. But I enjoyed it so much in the mountains, because the comrades were very good to us. So I was able to endure it there because almost all of my concerns were addressed. When you make a mistake, they would patiently explain it to you in a soft voice. That’s why we got along well with each other. Even when it was difficult, we enjoyed ourselves a lot. That’s why I decided to become a full-time member. But I told my comrades that I should visit my mother. They allowed me to see her, but my letter to my mother wasn’t delivered to her. We would be up by 4 a.m. and then we would get ready. That’s our Standard Operating Procedure. Either we would walk but we all had to be up by then because they said that’s usually the time that the enemy would attack. At 4:30 we would start walking. After walking for some time, then we would check around, visit the houses of the contacts, because sometimes they would be living in different sitios. Then we would gather the people together for a community meeting. Quite a large number would attend. Then in the afternoon, around 5 p.m., we would start walking, to transfer to another place. When we reached the place, since it was already evening, we would stop, and that’s where we would sleep. We would eat the food that we brought along with us, sometimes we had some rice, a pot, and we would cook our dinner. We would stay in the houses of the people. But whenever we stayed in the houses, we would be afraid that we might be raided by the enemy. That’s why I can’t sleep right away when we are in the houses of the masses. I was with a small group. There were just seven of us. There are propaganda units and also propaganda teams. Sometimes the masses would give some support to the party. I don’t really know where the funds come from. It would just arrive, and the team leader receives the money for the team. That’s what we would use to buy the needed supplies. The team leader would ask what we needed to buy. We didn’t have an allowance. We just specify what we need. Before I joined, according to the comrade who told my friend who brought me here, that there was an allowance of P300/month ($6), aside from supplying the things we need, that there was additional P300/month. So I thought that if they would supply our needs, then I could send the P300 to my mother. Then she would believe that I was really working. I thought that I could help my mother, but it turned out that it wasn’t true that I would receive this money. I really like the times we come together but there were times, when I felt so tired, because it was so tiring to keep on walking. So sometimes, I would request the comrades to rest for a while because I was so tired. Especially when there are messages that the enemy is around the area. Then they would say, what if we just left you behind because you are so slow. But I knew that they wouldn’t really leave me behind, I knew that. It was just a story. But sometimes I could convince them to rest, because I would really insist. Whenever it was time for our groups to separate, then we would cry. When we have meetings, then we are together for two to three days, then we have to separate again, it would be so lonely, we would cry, hug each other when we have to leave. So sometimes, we would tell each other not to cry, because tears could lead us to our defeat. So we just cheer each other up. It’s hard, but we would tell each other that we would see each other again. After three weeks, they let me hold a gun, but I was so afraid that it might fire accidentally, then I might get hit and die. So they asked me, what’s more important, that I die or I kill. So I told them. I won’t die if I just hold the gun. So sometimes, I had to bring the gun. Once, XX asked me to bring the gun, but it was so heavy. Especially at night, when we have to walk and we have to carry our pack, then you have to hold your slippers and it’s very dark. So I told him, “You be the one to bring the gun,” and he said “OK, I’ll carry the gun but you carry the bullets, just stay behind me so if there’s any emergency, you will be close by.” Sometimes, when we keep on walking you feel very tired and then when there’s news that the enemy is close by, I wonder, will I still have the strength to run when the emergency happens? Sometimes when they say that you are one the bringing some trouble and that I’m delaying them because I’m a girl and I’m moving very slowly. And then, most of them are men, while I’m the only girl in the group. But the truth is that, when we are going to move out, I get ready very quickly. Sometimes I would get so upset that I would cry, then, I just keep quiet. Sometimes I would cry and tell them to stop because I can’t bear it anymore. But sometimes they don’t want to stop fooling around, so I cry. The comrade who died was the one I would approach whenever I had a problem. He was very good and he knew how to get along with the comrades. He was the one who helped us to understand, I noticed that, but we were just friends, we were together a lot. My feelings developed but I didn’t speak about it because I was embarrassed. When we were raided, I was asleep and he couldn’t wake me up. Perhaps if he just left me behind, he wouldn’t have died. I didn’t hear the gunshots, so I didn’t get up, he tried to wake me up, so he lifted me up and then he jumped and I jumped with him. I heard someone moan, but I had to go. I thought of running back but I couldn’t do anything more because he was dead. So I thought if I go back, then I would probably die, too, and he  wouldn’t come back to life anyway. I didn’t see whom they had killed. But I think that the soldiers who raided us knew we were there from the start. When they saw me then they got hold of me. I was so mad, I really would have killed, if only I had a gun, I might have killed them. But by the time we reached the detachment, there wasn’t anything that I could do… I decided to surrender because I saw that none of my comrades had a gun and I didn’t have a gun either. I didn’t have a gun, so I decided to surrender. They asked me to crawl to their position, then, they caught me. Then they withdrew slowly towards their detachment. They were able to run. The only gun we had had been left behind. So that’s why they couldn’t defend, because they had no arms to use in attacking. So the soldiers asked me if I was in the armed group and I said no, because I was afraid that they would hurt me. So I said that I was just one of the masses. They asked me why I was in that area, so I said that I went there because they had called for a meeting. So it was only when we arrived in the detachment that I admitted that I was in the armed group. I would really want to finish school. It would really help me. I have cousins who talk about going back to the movement, but for me, the future is very dark if you go back. Even if there’s so much hardship, you shouldn’t mind it too much, just keep on persevering, then I can go back to school. I have many cousins who are in school. I would have stayed in the city to go to school and then to work, I would work and then study, but if you get fed up with work, then there’s no alternative but to get married. It is necessary to work hard, in spite of the hardship we are going through now, for example now we are having all these problems, we need to buy rice. Through all these hardships, I am determined to strive, to persevere. My mother keeps on arguing with my stepfather, they keep on fighting. So I tell them, we need to stop bickering, because the rice will not just appear on the table, can you send us to school if you only use your mouth, if you just keep on fighting? We need to work, if doesn’t matter if we don’t own anything, as long as we understand each other. We really have to stand for ourselves. Even if I am still young, I am training myself to be strong, even when the going is difficult. We never know what might happen, what’s important is that we stand for ourselves. Amongst my friends when I was still in school, I had a teacher who used to tell us of the difficulties she had gone through. Then I thought that she has been through a worse situation, even worse than our own situation, but she was able to graduate in spite of all the problems she faced. So I tell myself, we can look at the difficulties, but I will persevere, I won’t allow myself to be weakened. Because if I let all these problems overwhelm me, then I stop going to school. Maybe I should just get married. So it’s important to strive. For example, in going to school, if someone could help me to go school. In our poverty, nobody has enough. There is no one who can help, because the people have no drive, but at least they can give encouragement. I would be happy to accept some help…So I tell myself, just pray, just keep on striving, and somehow this can help in my studies. I want to graduate so that I can help them. My mother would like to see my younger brothers in school, to enroll them, if only my stepfather could provide the things they need for school, but he doesn’t have a job. So it’s already very difficult to buy food. So I’m thinking of going to the city to become a working student, but that’s very difficult, and it would even be worse, because my elder brother is here and I would be there and the transportation costs to go back and forth would cost a lot, that I could just use for my studies. If I have any money, then I need to explain to them, that I have to hold on the money, because my elder brother would tell me not to give the money directly to my mother. My brother would tell me, Denise, here’s some money but hide it and if you have money don’t give it directly to mother, because our stepfather would just rely on that. It’s not my obligation to provide for rice, soap. Those are not my children, those are their children. But when there’s nothing left to eat, I would pity them, so I would spend my money. But for now, I will just study a two-year secretarial course. I want to get involved in actions that can be of help. They can help in fighting corruption, or to help those in difficulties. Even when I was in the mountains, I was thinking very hard, even when I was very active, is it really necessary to kill? Then I would think at the time of the raid, can we shout and say let’s just talk about this? If only the enemy would listen, it would have been wonderful to shout, and the firing would stop and we would listen to each other. We would just talk and try not to use guns. I wish we could end all this violence and we can develop our country. Livelihood, that’s what’s really needed at the baranggay level, because many young people are jobless. They are just hanging around, that’s why they get involved in many kinds of vices. Giving them attention, being concerned for them, to give them guidance.","Denise became a child soldier in the Philippines at the age of 16. In the Philippines, where three major insurgent groups have fought the Philippine military since the 1960s, there are an estimated 2000 child soldiers. The Communist-oriented New People’s Army, established in 1968, began an intense recruitment of children in the 1990s. By 2000, some 25 percent of new recruits were children, and more than ten percent of its regular combatants are now under 18. Parents volunteer children to serve as combatants and camp guards. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front allows the training of children as young as 12. Parents volunteer their children, seeing it as an observation of Islamic teaching, and Muslim youth organizations recruit students from schools and colleges. The Abu Sayyaf (“Bearer of the Sword”), a Muslim separatist group which appeared in the late 1980s, uses Islamic religion to draw minors into the movement, for use as combatants, human shields, and hostages."
Dia,2011 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Columbia (trafficked from),Columbia (slavery location),"I used to work. I chopped firewood, and sold it, and I used to work in the fields, weeding, sowing, with my other brothers and sisters. We had to work hard. I had to go down to the village up to three times a day to sell firewood to get enough money together for food. I started when I was seven years old. My older brother used to beat us and swear at us. All of us have a different dad. As far as I know, when my mother was pregnant, my dad left. When I was a bit older my mother took me to his house, and my dad said that I was his daughter and that he would pay for my studies and he asked me to live there with him. He tried to abuse me when I was younger, and because I didn’t let him he got angry. In the end I was with my mother at home. She said that I had to behave myself, that I had to study, to get on with things, not to go and fall in love or anything like that, and I didn’t really pay attention to her because she was kind of crazy. That was all, she talked nonsense. “Well, you must be stupid to go and fall in love because the same thing will happen to you as happened to me,” that’s what she told us; that we shouldn’t fall in love, look at how much she had suffered, now not even her children loved her. She said she hasn’t even got children, she hasn’t got anyone to love her. At school there were some good teachers and some bad ones. Some taught you things. The teachers used to fight with the pupils, they used to expel people from the school, and they taught some people more than others. I had to be careful and do my homework so that we wouldn’t be punished, because if you failed the grade you were given a thrashing and you couldn’t study anymore. I didn’t want to study anymore. A family member was already ill by this stage and there was no one there to stay with her at home and so I said that I wasn’t going to study any more so that I could be with her and do the housework. Once I had a problem at home. I was scared, and so I went to the guerrillas secretly, so that no one would know, one day when I went down to the village to sell a bundle of firewood. I left at six in the evening. When I went down to the village the guerrillas called me over and told me that I had to go with them for about three days. And so after being with them for three days I asked to leave but they said I couldn’t…only those people that had been with them for three years could leave. Sometimes they say that it’s just for three days and then when you’ve been there for three days they don’t let you leave, they say: “no, now you have to face up to the situation and carry on in the organization.” I said I didn’t want to, I wanted to be with my family, that I wasn’t going to join and they said no—I had to join them. And so I had to join. I was there for six months. I didn’t get any training. When you arrive there with the other companions, you’re given a different name. They told me they were the ones who were going to help the country to recover. To help make changes, to help the people. I was given a pistol. In case of a battle I had to look for my comrades so that they would protect me and to go on ahead with the commander. I was also taught how to keep watch and how to talk to the people. The commander gave the orders and you had to obey them and if you didn’t obey them then you were punished. I was told: “you have to be at that house over there at ten o’clock and you have to give them a talk about the organization.” And sometimes I said: “oh, I don’t want to go and give talks,” because I used to be embarrassed by it. Then I was told I had to go and give that talk. If not, I’d be punished with 30 hours of guard duty. In the case of a firefight we had to leave all our things and just get the radio out of there. We were always a bit scared because if we lost that radio then maybe they’d kill us, because the commander used to say if that radio gets lost then you’ll pay for it. Pay with your life or with a punishment, for example, doing 30 trips to fetch firewood, 30 hours of guard duty and 30 days of cooking duty. You had to watch over the camps, because if you weren’t careful and the army attacked the camp and you managed to survive, you were blamed for everything that had happened. If something like that happened, if you cause a comrade to be killed, you were killed. The most difficult part was when there were battles with the army or when they said that they were going to attack a village. They came and called everyone together. “When you get there,” they said, “we’re going to attack this village and you all have to be on the look out.” You feel nervous and you think that maybe you’d be killed there and with family so far away. At that moment I missed my boyfriend and my whole family. I used to think that maybe I’d be left there, and my family wouldn’t realize. They leave you where you fall and then the army collects you and brings you in. When someone else was killed, that made me sad, that a comrade should fall, and maybe you’d die as well, or get injured. If the wounds were serious that you’d got, then you could die from that, and you’re in pain until you die out there. All of us went out, the ones that were killed were left there, and then you went back to the camp again. Sometimes you could call your family or write to them, but you couldn’t escape. You asked the commander for permission to call or write to your family. You wrote a letter and you showed it to him so that he could read it and see what you had written, and if he said “you can’t write this word,” then you had to cross it out. Everyone in the group was equal. For example, the equipment that we had to carry was about ten or 11 pounds, and everyone had to carry the same 11 pounds. For example, when a girl was ill, or at that time of the month, you said, she shouldn’t have to carry so much, but then they said: “no, everyone is equal.” You had to do what they said. I didn’t like walking because that made me tired and they all walk fast, and if you didn’t move fast then the commander said: “the person who doesn’t step on it tonight will do six hours of guard duty as punishment.” So you learn to walk quickly. If you had a good behavioral record and they could see that you were an enterprising person, then they trained you to be a commander. The commander decided everything. If you didn’t like the person that was going to be made commander, you just had to put up with it because it was an order and you had to. I didn’t want to have any kind of rank. Once I was left in charge of three girls and I was nervous, in case one of the girls should escape, and I’d have to pay for that. I would have to run after them, I couldn’t lose one of the girls. And there were a few who wanted to give themselves up to the army—they weren’t happy in the group. If you wanted to have a relationship with someone then you went to the commander and you asked him. If the commander said no, then you had to abide by that, if the commander caught you, if you carried on in secret, talking to the boy, he got angry and he punished you. The commander, if he had another three girlfriends, then you couldn’t say anything to him because he was the commander. A lad once told him, “you’ve got your girlfriend and then others,” and he said, “but that’s me and no one can say anything to me. If I have ten girlfriends then I have to be with all ten of them.” The women with the commander were next to him all day so that he wouldn’t give them guard duty. You had to respect them more than the other girls. He chose which one he wanted to be with. All the women there, even if you didn’t have a boyfriend, had to use contraception, because the commander used to say that no one could get pregnant there. If you got pregnant there, then that was your salvation because you were sent back home, but then when the child was born and grew up a bit, you had to go back again. Those were the rules of the organization. If you were already pregnant some people and didn’t want to tell the commander, then some had abortions. But if you told him then he sent you home when you were about five months pregnant, he sent you home, and people used to come and visit you, and were keeping an eye on you. You always get punished for getting pregnant, but the baby’s looked after. Though if you were pregnant without a partner you had to manage by yourself, and at home you weren’t really welcomed. If you were in an established relationship the guerillas acknowledged the child, but if not then they didn’t. An established relationship is having talked to the commander, and if he had given you permission to be in that relationship. That’s why there were a lot of abortions because no one acknowledged the child, and at home the dad would get angry, or the mother. Here, where I am, they tell me that I have to respect myself so that others respect me, and to learn to respect and be with other people, and to learn to get ahead with what I want, that despite all those upsets that I had, I have to get up again and carry on. I wanted to be a computer scientist. When I joined the guerrillas all my dreams went up in smoke. But now I want to get back to that, I want to get further ahead in what I can...not to regress. I have a special dream that I was going to be a computer scientist and have a good husband, and I was going to be rich and have lots of money and many things, I wasn’t going to be lacking anything. I thought that maybe the boyfriend I had was going to be my future husband. The person that I loved the most and who helped me with everything isn’t here anymore, but I have to carry on and one day someone else will arrive who I’ll love as much. At the moment I think I’m ok. I think I have to go further to be able to get along, to begin to express myself more, to talk to other people, and to be successful in everything that I can.","Dia was forced to join a guerilla group in Columbia for nine months at the age of 15, one of hundreds of thousands of children who participate in armies and armed groups in more than 30 countries around the world. The problem is most critical in Africa, where up to 100,000 children are estimated to be involved in armed conflict. Child soldiers also exist in Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, though international law sets 18 as the minimum age for all participation in hostilities. Both sides engaged in Columbia’s 40-year-old conflict have used children: the government-backed paramilitary Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, and the left-wing guerrilla groups Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) and Ejército de Liberación Nacional. Total estimates of the numbers of children fighting in paramilitaries and urban militias range from between 11,000 and 14,000. FARC has the largest number of minors, including several thousand under the age of 15. Women and girls constitute up to half of all recruits to the armed opposition groups and face pressure to enter relationships with male commanders. Children take part in combat, act as messengers, and lay explosives. Most are denied contact with their families."
Elira,2005 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Italy (slavery location),"I am from Elbasan. When I was 15, my parents married me, against my will, to a man aged 35, whom I did not love. So started my miseries. Not too long afterwards, I abandoned him and returned to my family. But my parents did not accept me back because I had dishonored them by leaving my husband. I had no support and nowhere to go. I got acquainted with a boy who was 20 who said he loved me and promised to marry me. He convinced me to go to Italy for “a better life.” I thought my sufferings now were at an end, but I did not know the real hell that was expecting me. I was compelled to work on the street. I did so for nearly three years. My exploiter savagely battered me frequently, mainly when I did not bring home the required sum or when he faced drug trafficking problems. During that time I gave birth to a son. Once he beat me so hard that I cannot remember, and I fell on the floor. A friend of mine passing by to meet me found me on the floor, covered in blood. She saved my life by taking me to the hospital. I gave evidence in Italy and returned to Albania with my son. Again, they did not accept me. They took in my son only, and I could not take care of him. Being destitute on the street again, I was forced to prostitute in Tirana, in the hotels and motels. I slept wherever I could—on the street, in the park. I decided my condition would be better in Italy. When I returned there, I worked on the street again and was caught by the police and taken back to Albania a second time. I find calmness and support in the shelter, and I now contemplate my future. I do not want anything else except to go home, to see and take care of my son, to be the mother he missed for so long.  ","Born in Albania, Elira was trafficked into Italy, where trafficking victims also arrive from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, China, and South America. One NGO estimates that 48 percent of the prostitutes in Italy are from Eastern Europe.
Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply. "
Farida,2000 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour Domestic slavery,Armenia (trafficked from) Forced labour Domestic slavery,Turkey (slavery location),"When my husband died I was left alone with my four children. I did not have money and the children’s needs were increasing, they needed education, clothing and so on. I could not find a job in Armenia. My neighbor who was also looking for a job told me that many of her friends had found work in Turkey through bus operators. We went there together and were very happy when the agency told us that upon arrival in Turkey people would be meeting us at the office of the travel agency. When we arrived in Turkey we went directly to the office and found a man waiting for us. He proposed us a job at the canteen of a factory he owned. We agreed that he would pay us $200 a week for ten hours of work per day. We also rented a room in a three-room apartment that we shared with two other groups: one group of three young men, the other three women from Russia. A week passed and when we asked for the salaries the man said that we had to work more and that he had to reconsider our salaries. We worked for a month and got no salary. We found another job in order to cover our accommodation. Every night we worked for four additional hours to get some more dollars to cover accommodation, food expenses and the delay in our salaries. At the end of the second month he told us that he didn’t need both of us anymore and that he was going to keep only me. At the beginning of the third month he gave me $100, but only when I asked him. I needed to send money to my son. He was serving in the army at the border of Armenia. My neighbors informed me that he was sick and that my children did not have money to buy medicines. I sent the money through a Turkish bus agency to Yerevan. Later when I asked for my pay he threatened me to report to immigration police about my expired visa. I was scared. Everybody knew what ‘Yabanja Shube,’ the immigration detention centre, meant. One of my friends was there. Later in Yerevan she told me what had happened to her. A group of policemen raped, beat and humiliated her for four days in a row. She said that there were three more women at the immigration prison who shared the same fate. She was deported in an almost unconscious state. We agreed to everything, every kind of humiliation, but not to go to this place. Every day when I came to work asking for the money the man requested additional favors from me: to serve in his family, to clean his house. I was doing all the work hoping that at last he would pay me. Once he told me that he would be very favorable to me if I agreed to have sexual relations with him. The next day he was more persistent. When I asked again about the money he said that he would immediately call the immigration police and imprison me for violation of the visa regime. I did not know what to do: I could not go back home because I had no documents and was afraid of the immigration police. So I had to accept his rules in order to get my passport. As soon as I received it I immediately bought a bus ticket to Yerevan. I heard from my roommates many similar stories. None of the migrant workers who lived in the apartment with me were satisfied with the working conditions, payment and attitude. None of them had a contract and none of the bosses wanted to legalize their work and stay. I do not know what to do now. When I heard about jobs in Turkey it seemed to me the best solution. Now I am back. I have the same debts, the same problems and four children to take care of.","Born in Armenia, Farida was trafficked to Turkey, where victims also arrive from Ukraine and Moldova. As well as Turkey and the UAE, Armenian women and girls are trafficked for sexual exploitation to Russia, Greece, and other European countries. In this narrative, Farida discusses the pressures that led to her seeking out work in another country, and also reveals that fear of the immigration police in Turkey made it harder for her to leave her situation. Like many others who return to their home country after being trafficked abroad, Farida notes that her circumstances are still as precarious as before she left."
Emee,2005 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Domestic slavery,Philippines (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Emee. I lived in a small agricultural community in and my father worked in the rice fields. When I was 16-years-old our neighbor and friend had their uncle, Mario, visit from Manila. He approached my parents and told them that, if they would like, he already had jobs for me and my 14-year-old brother in Manila. He said that we would be working for a family and that I would work in their home while my brother would work in one of their factories. He also said that we would be making enough money to be able to send money home and that my parents could expect money after only three months. It sounded like a good opportunity, five other teenage boys in the area had already agreed to go and he was the uncle of our neighbors, so we decided it would be okay. On the day of our departure, we took a bus to the city and went to the port. Mario left us in the afternoon in a small eatery next to the port and told us to wait until he came for us. Shortly before the ship was to leave in the evening he arrived and told us to follow him inside a truck that would drive into the ship’s hold and that we would wait there until some cargo had been unloaded. Once inside the ship we all got out and were shown, by another man, to an area where we could wait until the ship left. An hour after the ship had left the port we finally were able to go up to the passenger area. Mario had given us some food for the boat ride, so we decided to eat. When we arrived in Manila the next day Mario introduced us to a woman and told us to go with her. The woman took us by bus to Nueva Ecija. I was taken to the house of our employer while my brother, along with the five other boys were taken to one of the factories. Our employer owned a rice mill, warehouses and other stores where we would all work. When I arrived at the house I asked about my brother and they assured me he was okay, but I could not find out any clear information about where he was or when I could see him. I started work immediately and had no days off. Since I was not familiar with the area there was no way for me to try to sneak out and find him. I met another young girl at the house from Batangas, Maria, and together we did all the housework for the family of seven. Our employers expected us to work in the house and kitchen, do the laundry, clean the small piggery behind the house and sweep the yard among other details. We would work from 5am until well past sunset. After one month, I expected to receive my first salary but nothing came. When I asked, they told me that I would first have to pay off the travel expenses of the boat and bus fare in addition to other expenses. After three months, I had lost weight from not eating enough and working so hard. I waited until the end of the third month hoping to finally get a salary but still got nothing. Maria told me that in the six months she had been there, she had only received P800 or P900. I decided I must escape and convinced Maria to lend me some money to go to Manila. I left the house at dawn one day and rushed to the bus terminal. I was so afraid of getting caught and being forced to return that I did not even ask around about my brother. Maria had given me the address of some relatives of hers in Manila and so I went there and stayed with them while I waited for the reply to a letter I had sent to my parents. One day the cousin of my mother who lived in another part of Manila came and picked me up. I decided to stay with her while I searched for other work.","Emee and her brother were taken from her rural community with false promises of work for good money but then enslaved in Manilla. Emee was enslaved within the Philippines but an estimated 10 million Filipinos migrate abroad for work, and many are subjected to human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour throughout Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East."
Fatimata,2016 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Mauritania (trafficked from),Mauritania (slavery location),"I was the property of four masters from the same family. They shared me, so each one had a period of the year where I was at his service. I herded their goats from a very young age. But I was never allowed to milk the goats to feed myself or my children. I was only ever allowed to eat the leftovers from the masters’ meals, which I cooked. Sometimes my masters would see me getting ready to eat and they would suddenly confiscate my food. So sometimes my children and I would go for several days without eating. I never received any money or anything else for the work I did. When I went out with the animals for long periods, my children would remain with the larger family of masters. My 10-year old son became the slave of one of the masters, and was under his control all the time. This meant I never knew that my boy was eating enough, or if he was eating at all. Now I can hope for a better future. I want to do training that will enable me to set up a profitable business to support my family. All I want is to live a dignified life, and be able to feed and educate my children.","Mauritania is one of the last countries in the world where people are still born into hereditary slavery, which means they are literally owned by other people, and forced to work for masters their entire lives. People in slavery come from the Haratine ethnic group, historically enslaved by White Moors. They can be bought and sold, or given as gifts, and face a lifetime of exploitation and abuse. Rape of female slaves is common and their children also become slaves. They are Muslims, and many believe that it is Allah’s wish for them to be enslaved because they are told that their paradise is bound to their Master. In reality, Islam dictates that a Muslim cannot enslave a fellow Muslim. Since 2007 slavery has been criminalised in Mauritania but the law is not enforced and the government is reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the problem. With support from Anti-Slavery International, Fatimata’s master was convicted for slavery in a landmark case in May 2016."
Flor (Narrative 2),2009 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Mexico (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"The recruiters contacted me in my hometown. It was a good opportunity to go to the US. Everything was paid for. They told me that I’d have a job, food, and housing. But I had to leave in three days. But it was good. My daughter had been sick and passed away. When she was sick, I didn't have money to take her to a hospital. I felt I was failing as a mother, and I became depressed. I wanted to leave. I thought this was a good opportunity. I didn't want what happened to my baby to happen to the rest of my children. I asked my mother to take care of my children. Then, I left. Everything looked legal. They asked me for my documents. Until then, I thought everything was fine. I arrived in Mexico City; then I flew to Tijuana. In Tijuana, I met my trafficker. The only contact I had was my sewing teacher. I had never met the trafficker, but I thought it was okay because the sewing teacher was coming with me, and we were going to work in the sewing industry. Then, we talked to the coyote. It was me, the trafficker, her niece, and the sewing teacher. The coyote told us that the first person to cross would be my sewing teacher. Then the trafficker and her niece would go. Then I would cross. Before we crossed, they left me alone in the hotel. Then, the coyote took me to so many places. It was 7pm when they said I would finally cross the border. They changed my clothes and took me to a salon. If they asked at the checkpoint, I was supposed to say I was going to San Diego for a dinner. They gave me a cell phone with a number. Everything looked like I was going to a party. I remember the checkpoint guy was a tall blue-eyed handsome man. He let me cross. I met my sewing teacher and trafficker on the other side and they took us to… I never learned the name of the city they took us to. First, we went to the trafficker's son's home. We had to wake up at 4am to clean the yard and wash the cars (there were four or five). Then, she took us to the shop. I was tired. I had emotional scars. I was exhausted. She showed me what I had to do but never discussed hours, pay, or how much work. There were no other workers when we arrived. We worked until eight. Those three first days, and we had to sleep in the shop. The shop wasn't huge, but it held fifty or so [people]. There was no place to shower. We had to sleep there, and my sewing teacher and I had to share a bed. There were five or six women who worked with me. At night, the trafficker left her niece to watch us and closed the bars. There were only little glass doors. I wasn't able to escape. I could only wash in the sink. She said that she wasn't able to install a shower because it was so expensive. I wasn’t able to do anything about it. She said she would contact the authorities and that I would go to jail. She threatened my family. She was angry all the time. She would say, ""Good morning,"" and then call me a brat in English, but I didn't understand. I asked the other workers what it meant. She was physically and verbally abusive. She'd push and pinch me all the time. One day I had pain in my chest and fever. I told her I needed to see a doctor. One of the workers also told the trafficker that I needed to see a doctor.  We were having lunch at a big table when the trafficker asked me if I was sick. I stood up because all my co-workers were there, and I felt embarrassed. I was leaving lunch. I stood up to go. She said, ""I'm talking to you. You never leave unless I tell you to leave."" She pulled my hair and made me sit, and the whole time she was laughing. I was so embarrassed, and I wanted to cry. I was angry and ashamed. All mixed feelings. I couldn't move. I didn't know who to tell. The co-workers said I should say I'm sorry. Me—sorry for what? Sorry because I feel sick? They said if I didn't say I was sorry that things would get worse. They were right. The trafficker came to me and told me that everything was going to change…that it would be different. It was worse. My body was like a zombie. Everything was worse. Abuse was escalating. She called me all kinds of things. She made me feel so scared. I feel bad to repeat those things. She told me she could kill me…that she could do what she wanted. I had no ID. No one knew I was here. She knew the law. She had friends. She knew a lawyer. She knew English. She had connections in Mexico. She said that if I killed you, you would have no rights. She said, “Dogs have more rights in this country than you.” I felt so bad because I knew it was true. I had nothing. I had no friends, no money. Everybody was against me. I was afraid. I kept thinking they will put me in jail. I'm illegal. Especially coming from Mexico where the authorities are so corrupt, how could I trust the authorities here? I had to work long hours. At 4 or 5am, I started sewing only with a little needle with no lights until 8am. The other workers came at 8am and turned on the lights, and I had to act like everything was normal. A truck was parked in front of the door. There was no room to escape. I sewed, then ironed, then sewed. When the workers left, I had to sweep the huge shop, and then take out the garbage. Then sew again until 1am. She said I wasn't allowed to go to bed until she finished working. I tried to convince her to let me leave with a co-worker. She said no. I was desperate. I felt like I was living a nightmare. My back hurt so much. I ate only when she told me I could eat. I only had ten minutes. I was losing hope. My mother had always told me don't forget to pray. Even when I was so exhausted, I prayed. Mom told me not to forget to pray. I remember one day I asked her to allow me to go to church. I said I really wanted to go, but instead she gave me more sewing. I said “I don't care if I have to sew day and night… but I want to go to church.” I was so stubborn that I couldn't give up. She told me that I was stubborn. Finally, she said I could go, but only after I had finished sewing. I was so happy. My tiredness went away. I worked all night. She said so and so church was on so and so street. I had no idea where it was. I had never been out. She asked if I knew where I was. I said of course, but I had no idea. That day, I woke up early, finished working. I was nervous and excited. It was the first time I had been outside in forty days. The sewing teacher, who was also a victim, had tried to leave, but she had been punished. So I was scared. That day, I finished working, and I walked out. I didn’t know where to go. I was scared and kept thinking, what would happen if the trafficker showed up? A co-worker came by, and she asked if I was alone. I didn't answer. I gestured to a person [my sewing teacher] hiding in the grass. She gave me paper with a phone number on it and left. I found a payphone and picked it up, but the operator was in English. I didn't know English. I didn't even know how to put in a coin! It was a Sunday. There was no one on the street. No cars passed by. I wasn't planning to escape…I just wanted to go to mass and come back. Finally, I saw a Spanish speaking person. He helped me with the pay phone, and then asked, ""Have you just arrived?"" ""No."" I said. ""How long have you been here?"" he asked me ""Forty days."" I replied. He didn't know what I had been doing. He dialed the number. My co-worker answered the phone and asked, “Where are you?” She said she could come and get me. I was so scared to upset my trafficker. The co-worker picked us up and took us to a restaurant, and the food was so good. But I was so nervous. When we got to the restaurant, it was the first time I'd ever talked to the co-worker. I'd been so silent. She said she knew something was wrong because I would never speak. I told her I didn't speak because the trafficker was threatening my family. We spent the night at her house. Then, she went to work. The trafficker was so mad. She hit my co-worker. While we were at her house we cleaned the whole home and didn't go anywhere. Finally my co-worker came home and told us we had to look for a place because the trafficker threatened her. She called a friend in San Diego to pick us up. We stayed there until Valentine's Day. At the house in San Diego we were with a young pregnant girl. The trafficker found the phone number and kept calling and asking for us. Finally the husband came home, and the trafficker asked to speak with him. She asked if he had seen me and my sewing teacher. Then a crew of people came to the house. One of them was a co-worker. I was scared. How had they found us? They took the husband outside and put handcuffs on him. His wife was scared. I was scared she'd be so stressed she'd lose her baby. I'm like, “Oh my God, she might lose the baby to protect us.” I felt so helpless. I said, “call the police,” but the police just passed by. In Mexico, people who have money have justice. It seemed the same. I was scared they would kill me. I felt desperate. I thought to escape through the backdoor. But then I thought maybe they have guns, and they'll just shoot me. So I just waited, and I thought this is my way to die. I was crying and crying. I felt like it was the last minute of my life. I saw another co-worker, who knew everything. She saw me crying and asked why. I said I thought this was the last day of my life. She told me not to worry about the trafficker. Someone had called CHIRLA [Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles], and CHIRLA had called INS, and they were already investigating the case. But I escaped a few days after they came to rescue me. They said all the co-workers were in jail, but the boss was free. She said I was the only one who could set the co-workers free. The co-worker that had helped me had been blamed by the trafficker as the instigator. But another co-worker had started for one day, and she was an FBI agent. She had a camera in her lunch bag and had taped everything. So when the trafficker denied everything, they brought in the FBI agent. They said if I can cooperate, I can help, but I have to go with them. They said I could stay legally, and they would protect me. I wanted to free my co-workers, so I said ok. They took me to INS. It was top security. CHIRLA had told INS, but they wanted the rights of workers to be respected. They took my fingerprints and interrogated me. I thought whatever is happening here, it's just as bad as with my trafficker. But I wanted to free my co-workers. We couldn't communicate, but he was really nice. Then I went to the CHIRLA office, and I stayed with Angelica, the Director. I stayed there until July, when I came to Alexandria House [shelter]. CHIRLA then brought me to CAST. The trafficker only got six months of house arrest. She never stopped chasing me. She went to visit my mother and tried to pay my mother twenty dollars for information about me.But from CAST I learned how to change the situation. This is a monster without a face or hair. It has so many different faces. Faces like forced labor. It is slavery; we're not free. Sex trafficking is another face. We need to be working hard to fight all faces of human trafficking. We need to work hard and educate people, and our politicians. We need to bring opportunities to origin countries so women and children wouldn't have to migrate. We can implement better trade so they can have life with dignity. They work really hard, but it's not enough to help children. After witnessing your child passing away it changes your life forever. Right now it's a huge darkness. Let's spread the light. Living in trafficking, they take the light out of you – they not only take away your freedom, but your right to dream. They did it to us, and now we are doing everything possible to stop them. We have the power to take back that power and spread the light. We can do it. We are just starting but we cannot do it alone. As I said and I always say… just do something. If you yourself cannot help, then call the police. You don't need a coin to dial 911. Sometimes I feel like crying because this should not happen to anyone else. No one should go through what I went through…. I am proud of the Caucus. We are growing and are learning… I didn't understand it when it started. I thought I was the only one. Now I’m a leader. I am proud to take be a Caucus member. To be a leader. I am a stakeholder in the caucus. Ima, you make me feel like that. You make me feel special. I don't have sisters, but in the Caucus group I can laugh, cry; I can tell how I feel. I'm not judged when we are a group. At the Caucus you can speak freely. I can't do that outside the group. I have friends, but for safety reasons, I can't tell them what happened to me. I keep my shades down all the time… The FBI asked if I wanted her to pay for my work. I said “No. I just want to be free.” I'm proud of the Caucus. We went to Sacramento to see how we can make a change… I want my children to be proud of mom and to be part of the movement. They were not with me because of my trafficker. I want them to join this movement because people have heard enough from me. But people should also hear my children's experience growing up without a mother. Also, if I have the opportunity, I want to be a police officer. I want to inform the police and help others. First, I would tell [trafficking victims] not to lose hope. Second, that there's a lot of people who are working hard to end this issue. Say something to someone. You can tell a police officer, and they know about trafficking now. See how far we have come? Monsters use the silence. That's why we have to raise our voices and say something. This is not fair to someone – a child, a stranger, etc. We all have a feeling…If you suspect something, ask questions. We can start questioning. Without the Caucus, I would feel lost, like there is no one who cares. No motivation. Because we enrich each other and empower each other each time we see each other. We encourage ourselves to help each other. And we have food at our meetings! We eat together first, and then we discuss issues and check in…. Now that I'm with CAST, I feel like I'm allowed to dream…. That's what was taken away and now I'm dreaming. Dreams can come true.  ","Flor was trafficked into the US from Mexico and enslaved in forced factory labour.

Flutura,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Albania (trafficked from),Italy (slavery location),"I am 20 years old. I was born in a northern city of Albania. I have three sisters and two brothers as well as my father and my mother. We have always been living under a patriarchal mentality where the man of the family has the right to judge and decide for everything and everybody. We had good living conditions, though, so I managed to finish high school with an average of marks 8.7. My desire was to proceed to the university, and I was interested in pursuing law. During the summer after I finished high school I started to work in a fast food restaurant in order to help my family, as we moved to the capital city for a better life. In the meantime I met a boy whom I used to like a lot, but my father did not allow me to see him, so I respected his wishes, and I broke with the guy. After one month or so a neighbor next to my house told my father that a cousin of hers was interested in marrying me. She told my parents he was rich and had serious intentions towards me. I could not stand this woman; indeed, she seemed to me a very cheating person. So I told my father I was not going to say yes to her and her cousin. I had other plans for my life than getting married. We quarreled for some days, then it seemed everything was settled down. One day as I was coming back home as usual, a car stopped at my feet and two men kidnapped me by force. They used violence; it was late afternoon and for my bad luck nobody was walking by. They kept my eyes closed and I found myself in a city of near the seaside. We stayed there for one week. When I opened my eyes I could easily tell who the persons were. One of them was the guy that was supposed to marry me. I could not believe my eyes at first, and then I understood their real intentions. In the meantime they abused me physically, sexually and psychologically as well. Then we moved to the city of Vlora. Once there we stayed one night only, and we left for Italy by speedboat. As soon as we arrived there we met some other girls that were there for the same reasons. We all had to work as prostitutes in the streets. For sure I refused to work, but you would never believe what kind of persons they are and what methods they use to keep you feeling as a prisoner, as a victim. One time when I could hardly withstand the torture, they threatened to kill my family and to kidnap my little sisters who were only children at that time, so I accepted the work. They took all the money I used to earn. I used to work every night in the streets and used to earn enough money for them, or this is what I believed. But they were never satisfied and no deal to make with them was ever possible. So I started looking for ways to escape by myself. Once I tried to get hidden in the house of a priest, as he offered to help me. There were some other girls there as well. He called the police in order to help us. We stayed at the police station one night and they deported us to Albania. But very soon the pimp found out were I was and for a second time we went illegally to Italy in the where I worked for about nine months. During this time I met with a guy, who used to be my regular client. He used to behave well to me; he respected me and showed compassion for my story and experience. So by passing the time we became good friends, and then we fell in love with other. He proposed that I leave with him, and I reflected quite well and escaped with him. I did not denounce anybody because I was still very afraid and unsafe. I lived with him for one year and a half. I met his parents and his sister. We did not tell them anything about my story. I was afraid they would prejudge me even it was never my fault. I tried to contact my family in order to say to them I was living a normal life, but only my mother and one of my sisters would accept to talk to me. I had not spoken to my father and brothers for two years. We decided with the guy I met about the possibility of getting married one day, sooner or later, but I was still an illegal immigrant, without regular papers. So I decided to come back to my country, I went to the police and told them about my situation. They deported me to Albania. I went to live with the nuns for some time and then in a safe place in Albania. There they helped me to contact my family, to set up the relationships with them. This was a hard process at the beginning, but after time, things settled down. Now after some months I get along well with them although it’s still not so easy. In the meantime I contacted the guy to tell him I was fine. He promised to come and marry me here in my country in order to have the possibility of preparing the documents to go back with him to Italy. Now I am trying to start a new life with him as well as with my family.","Born in Albania, Flutura was trafficked into Italy, where trafficking victims also arrive from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, China, and South America. One NGO estimates that 48 percent of the prostitutes in Italy are from Eastern Europe. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply."
Ganggang,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Japan (slavery location) Philippines (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Ganggang. I have two older brothers and one younger sister. When I was younger, I graduated high school. My father was a hardinero at a local college, so I would have gotten a reduced tuition if I had decided to go to school there. I could have gone to college, but the course I wanted to take was not offered so I decided not to go. Instead, I wanted to just hang with my “barkada.” This did not make my mother happy, especially when I stayed out late at night. We fought about this several times. When I was 18-years-old a gay friend of mine told me about a woman who was looking for girls to work in Japan. He went with me to see the woman. She told me that she was looking for singers and dancers to work in Japan. I was very excited; I enjoy singing and I have always wanted to work overseas. I ran home to tell my mother about the great opportunity, but all she did was get mad. She did not want me to leave with the woman. I convinced my mother to let me go. The women told me it would cost P30,000 to get to Japan. I told her that we did not have the money, but she was very kind and said she would loan us the money. Within a week I was on a boat going to Manila. As soon as we landed in Manila I was taken to a house. I was not allowed to leave the house. Food was brought in and I was trained how to dance and serve drinks to customers. After one month of training I was told I was going to Japan. I was handed travel papers that looked legal to me and had all my correct data on them. I went to the airport. I did not talk to anyone at the airport about my travels; my caretakers did it all. I got on the plane with about 15 other girls. We were all very excited. As soon as we got off the plane in Japan our passports were taken away from us. We were taken by van, with tinted windows, to a dormitory. We were not allowed to leave. That night we were taken to the club we were to work at. We were told to only observe and sit with customers. After one week we were instructed to dance and sing. If the girls were good singers they let them continue to sing, but if they were not they were immediately asked to ""go out"" with customers. They allowed me keep singing which made me very happy. After a couple of weeks a customer had come in and asked to “go out” with a particular girl, but the girl was not there. She was sick. The club owner offered the customer to “go out” with me instead. That night the customers forced himself on me. He was nice though and I made good money that night. After that I figured, ""Nabasa na man ko, maligo na lang!""(I’m already wet, so I will just take a bath!). Besides, we were being watched all the time. I could not have escaped. Soon I had many customers. Some would hit me and abuse me. One time I thought I was going to die. I was forced to do things I didn’t like to do. If I refused to ""go out"" with a customer one of the owners would beat me. In time I met two nice customers who were the only two men to ""take me out"". They would take me out and show me Japan. I was in Japan for one year, before I was allowed to return to the Philippines. In that year the owner kept all my earnings and my passport. It was not until I arrived at the airport to return to the Philippines that I was given any money and my passport back. When I returned home all the money I had made was spent within two-three months. My family continued to pressure me to return to Japan to make more money. I don’t know if my family knows what I do in Japan, but sometimes my brothers tease me about what my job is there. The whole family still wants me to return to Japan. Eventually I gave in and returned to Japan. I still continue to go back to Japan and return with a little money for my family.","Ganggang was enslaved in the Philippines at the age of 18 and then trafficked to Japan, where she was imprisoned and expected to entertain and have sex with bar customers. In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism."
Gau,2007 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was captured when I was about 11 years-old. The Arabs killed many people. They shot my father. I saw him die. I don’t know what happened to my mother. My sister Achol and my brother Ngong were captured with me. But we were soon separated from each other. I never saw them again. On the way to the North, we reached Grinty, and I couldn’t keep up with the others. One of the Arabs pulled out a knife and was going to cut my throat. But another Arab saw what was happening and jumped on the one with the knife. He saved my life. The knife cut my face instead of my throat. The Arab who saved me was Ali Majoub. He became my master. I looked after his camels. He was kind to me. He gave me the name Majoub Ali Majoub, as if I were his son.","Gau was ‘redeemed’ (bought out of slavery) by Christian Solidarity International (CSI), a Zurich-based international human rights organization, in January 2007. Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Giselle,2002 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Philippines (trafficked from),Philippines (slavery location),"My father had a problem, because he had another woman. I heard that he had another wife. He moved from place to place. Sometimes he would go home only once a month. I heard that my father had other children. So my father sometimes could not provide the tuition fees for my other siblings. When he gets home, he would shout and he was drunk. He would say lots of different things. So my sister was not able to finish school and got married early. My father seemed to be always mad at me and at all of us. My elder brother told me that our father doesn’t love us. He had a big stick that he would use to beat us up; this was a branch of the guava tree. That’s why we had to follow him. Just one mistake and he would hit us directly. My sister didn’t even have a boyfriend, but she just left because she couldn’t stand it anymore. Even when we were bigger, he would still beat us. We didn’t even understand what we did wrong. I can’t understand why he treated us that way when we did nothing wrong. We follow all his orders. Just one mistake and he would hit us. When he would start beating us, my mother would tell us, just go to my sister’s house and we would reply, No, we will just be an added problem there. When we were still small, my father wasn’t like that. He only changed when he started having another woman. All of us were badly affected. Children really need their parents. Sometimes, my elder brother would cry. Even my brother who was 18 then, decided that he would just take care of himself because our father didn’t take care of us. Our mama was also being battered. But we would rather stay with her. We didn’t want to be away from her. My father would threaten us that when those two children come, I will kill them! From grade three onwards, I stayed in my aunt’s house. Then one day, I saw my aunt crying. Then I found out that my mother had died. I didn’t have a chance to see her before she died. When she died, that’s when everything seemed to fall apart. We didn’t know what to do. My father sold our family house, so we had nowhere else to go home too. He started living in the house of the other woman. My father had become crazy for the other woman. We did not receive a single centavo from the proceeds of the sale of the house. My elder brother paid for all the funeral expenses of my mother. When my father came to the wake, my brothers and sister and I were all very mad at my father. My brother and my father had a brawl in front of the coffin of my mother, because we found out that my mother didn’t have any medical check-ups with the doctor because all the money had been given to the other woman. We didn’t speak to him. We were all grief-stricken and mad with him. After I finished grade five, I couldn’t stand it any more. I wasn’t very comfortable in my aunt’s house. I was wondering, “Who is my family?”… Around that time, the situation at home was getting worse. I had problems with my sister-in-law. I couldn’t bear it anymore. My sister-in-law would say 10 things for each statement that I said. I didn’t like that. She accused me of being lazy and unhelpful. But I disagree with her… I told her that I was doing my best to be helpful to them. However, she remarked that it would be better if I left the house so that they would have fewer problems. It was very difficult to get along with her. They just wanted me to be there to take care of their small child. Poor families have many children and they come one after another just like do-re-me. But in the movement, there is allowance for each child of the adult comrades. They entered the movement because they were hoping that the movement could help in their family problems. Never mind if the movement’s objectives are very difficult to achieve, like defeating the government. Never mind if the movement’s chances of winning are unsure. Inside the movement it’s like I have a mother, a father and elder siblings but we get along well with each other even if we don’t even know where each of us comes from. I don’t know the details of their life. Inside the movement I found the family life that I was searching for. I really do not know who they really are but they are very good people and they are like my family. They’re very different from my real family. The things that I have been looking for in a family, it seems that I found it with my comrades. The only difference is that it’s not done through the correct means. I said, Comrade, what if we get shot? I would ask them the most difficult questions. She replied, Well, if that happens, it’s plain misfortune. I was really sad when I heard that my sister was getting married because I really wanted to witness it. So I asked the comrade, may I go home to visit? I had heard of the wedding through a neighbor of one of our contacts. The comrade said, How would you explain to them where you came from? It’s possible for you to go home as long as you think you can explain without giving them the real information. So I thought, How am I going to be able to explain why I do not have any money and why I have become so dark complexioned. Therefore, I told the comrade that I would not go. I was so mad at myself. I saw the pictures of the wedding later, when I got injured in the encounter. After my injury I was in the hospital. I took off my IV; I felt that I did not want to live anymore. I was thinking that I will be rejected by my family and my peers in my community, because when we were still together they said that the armed group was bad. I wasn’t ready to explain to them then. But all they said was that they had missed me. I couldn’t face my father. I didn’t want to live. I didn’t take my medicine. I flushed my tablets down the toilet. What I wanted was to go out of the hospital, already dead. The hospital staff wanted to me to see a priest, but I said what’s the use of seeing a priest, can he fix my injury? I also didn’t want to see my comrades because I felt so ashamed. If I meet my old comrades I will talk to them. But if they don’t want to talk, then I won’t. I cannot snub them. But I will try to persuade them to go down from the mountains. I will try to discourage them. I will ask them if they want to be injured like me. Just stay here. I want to be able to study, to stand on my own and be able to help my father. When I am in front of my father, I cannot talk to him. I am still mad at him. But sometimes, I feel that I would like to go home with him. After a while, I will eventually be able to stand on my own, and then I can help my father. Whatever my dreams are, I have to act on them, otherwise nothing good will happen to me. What I need now is patience, perseverance. I ask the Lord, Don’t allow me to become weak! I am being compared to a spring of water. I am also strong and I can climb well. Once, when I was climbing, there was this person who pointed to another person who was climbing. The other person was panting and looking pale, while I was taking it easy. Once someone pointed out that the clothes that I wash are cleaner than the clothes washed by someone who used two good hands! In volleyball, even if I’m injured I can hit the ball stronger than the others. My performance is similar to the abled persons there. But sometimes there are obstacles in my life and I just pray to the Lord. Sometimes when I need help and I worry that there might be no one around to help. But the mind can be strong. Sometimes I worry that I can’t manage, but in the end you realize you can do it. I entertain the idea of going home if there are people there who I can rely on. But I will not go back with such an intention. Well, maybe I can go back to my brother, if my family is still there. But then I don’t think so. I’m in a difficult situation… I still don’t know how I will go back home. I think it is better for girls still in the movement to decide to come down on their own. But it is difficult if you go to the revolutionary area, to talk to them and try to convince them to go down from the mountains. I felt that if I go home, nothing good would happen to me… I was so happy that they came to visit me. I can’t take it anymore when they visit me then leave again. I hope when they come here I can come with them as they leave. Or maybe I can go to them as a surprise. How I wish that when they come to visit me I could come home with them already. I don’t know how life is outside anymore. I don’t have big dreams. My only dream is for me to have a simple job and to be able to come home and be with my family again.","Giselle became a child soldier in the Philippines at the age of 15. In the Philippines, where three major insurgent groups have fought the Philippine military since the 1960s, there are an estimated 2000 child soldiers. The Communist-oriented New People’s Army, established in 1968, began an intense recruitment of children in the 1990s. By 2000, some 25 percent of new recruits were children, and more than ten percent of its regular combatants are now under 18. Parents volunteer children to serve as combatants and camp guards. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front allows the training of children as young as 12. Parents volunteer their children, seeing it as an observation of Islamic teaching, and Muslim youth organizations recruit students from schools and colleges. The Abu Sayyaf (“Bearer of the Sword”), a Muslim separatist group which appeared in the late 1980s, uses Islamic religion to draw minors into the movement, for use as combatants, human shields, and hostages."
Given (Narrative 1),2008 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Zambia (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Given Kachepa and I am honored to be here with you to tell you about my experience with human trafficking. As reported by Kevin Bales in Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy, slavery is not a horror safely consigned to the past; it continues to exist throughout the world, even in developed countries. Modern slavery hides behind different masks, using clever lawyers and legal smoke screens, but when we strip away the lies, we find someone controlled by violence and denied all of their personal freedom to make money for someone else. There are more slaves alive today than all the people stolen from Africa in the time of the transatlantic slave trade. The modern version of slavery is called Human Trafficking. It uses false passports and airline tickets. It packs slaves into trucks and bribes border guards. It covers its tracks with false work contracts and fraudulent visas. The new slavery is like a disease for which no vaccine exists. Until we really understand it, and until we really know what makes it work, we have little chance of stopping it. And the disease is spreading. The sale of human beings is now tied with illegal drug sales as the highest money making scheme in the world. I’m here today speaking to you as one of the 27 million victims of human trafficking. I’m excited to share my story with you and hope that you will learn something new about Human Trafficking. I am twenty one years old and come from Zambia which is located in south central Africa. I grew up in Kalingalinga, as you would expect, very poor. I have three brothers and two sisters and I’m an orphan. My journey to America began after losing both my parents and a long suffering from poverty. I now understand my parents’ deaths could have been prevented with the right medical care. In Kalingalinga, people die daily from easily preventable diseases. Approximately 70 percent of the people survive on less than a dollar and one meal per day. The house I lived in was made from muddy bricks and had no electricity or running water. When I joined the Zambian Acapella Boys Choir in 1997, I was looking for a new direction. At church, I made new friends and found spiritual joy that overshadowed my physical suffering and devastating loss of my parents and older sister. In 1998, my dream came true, when a nonprofit American Christian organization (TTT Partners in Education) based in Sherman, Texas promised to build schools in Zambia in return for my work in the United States with the Zambian Choir. Also promised was a monthly income for my poor un-educated family and education for me while in America. In Zambia, it is easy to convince people with hopes of a better life and future. Who would not want to come to America? When you live on less than a dollar per day, America is heaven. Sometimes even when people know their sacrifices ahead; they are enticed to go because of the promises. To parents the hopes of a better life far outweigh the risks and so they let their children go when the promises sound so good. In addition, traffickers prey on the lack of education, language and communication barriers. Contractual agreements are confusing and futile. Like many Zambian recruits I fell for the dream to help my community, my ailing Zambian Family and looked ahead for a brighter future for myself. Unfortunately, my dreams were shattered as I became a slave, singing 4-7 concerts a day, asking for love offerings, selling CDs and having no control over my life. My passport was withheld from me. I was made to believe; if I escaped I would be caught and deported because no one would have interest in helping me. I was told and asked to sing and smile at all times even in times of sickness or exhaustion. If I inquired about money or school, Bible scriptures on obedience and respect were embellished to shame me. If we did not sing the choir manager cut off the gas in our trailer so we could not cook. Sometimes I felt like a puppet on string being moved around. Many days we got up at 4:30 a.m. to travel to sing. At the home base, we cooked and did laundry regardless of how excruciating our schedule was. Our suffering was both psychological and physical. Just three months after we arrived, we were forced to hand dig a swimming pool in Texas. This was miserable and extremely strenuous for my young 11-year-old body. We were not allowed to contact our families and host families were told not to allow us to use the phone or give us any money, calling cards or their own personal contact information. We were searched each time we left a host home to see if we had violated the TTT rules. Fearing deportation and embarrassing our families, we sang in sadness for 9 more months until the ministry decided to carry out their plan and deport four choir boys considered untrustworthy and disobedient. They were considered disrespectful because they continued to ask about the education and funds promised to us and our families. But without conclusive evidence of disobedience, to protect our friends, as we’d done many times (to protect our group), the whole choir demanded to be deported. Through this quarrelsome process, the Sherman police department was alerted, but the nature of case was unusual for them, so they contacted the U.S Citizenship and Naturalization Services (INS) to handle the case. Then an INS agent was dispatched to Sherman to enforce the deportation of the four members. The first day, two boys were picked up in handcuffs and the next day two more boys were removed. Besides losing my parents, seeing my friends in handcuffs being harassed was one of the most uncertain and scariest moments of my life. I was scared because I didn’t know if my fate would be the same. Only a few days after the four boys had been picked up, the remaining seven of us decided to stay in the United States. It was better to keep hope than face the scrutiny and shame of returning to Zambia without anything. The United States Department of Labor got involved and demanded the ministry pay us. TTT partners in Education then furnished a monthly income, but retained most of our money for our expenses, such as house rent, school, electricity, food, and my airline ticket home. I had about forty dollars per month left. After about 12 more months of continued singing, we were tired and confused as we learned our choir mates had not been deported but were living in host homes and going to school. We felt deceived knowing that our friends had new found freedom. We demanded the money that had been promised to us. TTT refused to pay us and even though we were scared, we contacted the INS agent that had picked up our friends 9 months previously. He came to pick us up. The INS agent took us to First Baptist Church in Colleyville, TX and members from the church provided lots of help. My mom (Sandy Shepherd) helped us find homes and file legal paper work mandatory to stay in the United States. You see, I look just like you. You cannot tell I was a slave in a boy s choir. The sad thing is, many people had been contacted about Zambian Acapella choirs. Governors, Department of Labor, Janet Reno, Senators and Congressman at the State and Federal levels, the FBI, and even Oprah Winfrey, but they all declined to listen. They did not understand the problem. My T Visa was granted in August. This allows me to stay in the United States after proving I was a human trafficking victim. I am grateful to INS, First Baptist Church Colleyville and my mom. I’ve applied for my permanent residence. However, I find myself in disarray again. In 2000 the American government formulated the T visa. T visa recipients are still waiting for the regulations to be issued from Homeland Security that will guarantee our freedom with a green card for permanent residence. At this moment, I have not seen my family in Zambia for 10 years and I do not know when that will happen.  While everything I endured was bad, I learned how to forgive. My faith in God is my guiding rod. Losing my mom at age 7 and dad at age 9 caused me to doubt God s love for me. Why were my parents taken when I was just a kid? Why was I used and exploited? Through this process I’ve learned so much. I m a better person because I decided to become a survivor and make the best of my bad experience. My perspective on life is that it’s important to value each and every human being because we are all special in one way or another. I am blessed to be a senior at The University of North Texas and hope to go to dental school. Another way we consumers can help fight modern day slavery is to buy slave free produced goods. The symbol that says Free Trade is a logo that ensures that that item has been made by people who have been paid for their work. For example, you can find this trademark on some brands of tea, chocolate, rice, spices, sports balls and coffee. You can look at the National Green Pages website to obtain more information. You know I believe we all have a calling, we were all born for a reason, and that God did not put us on earth for our own pleasures. My encouragement to you is that find your calling and help do something positive for this world. Remember, look beneath the surface and call one of the hot line number if you think there is a problem. It’s better to make the call and perhaps save someone’s life than to ignore them and not become involved. If you don t fight human trafficking, who will? Narrative as delivered as a speech to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.","Given was brought to the United States from Zambia at 11 to work as part of a boys’ choir. He was promised an education and pay for his work, but instead was exploited and enslaved. Rescued by the U.S Citizenship and Naturalization Services (INS) in 2000, Given speaks out about his experience in an effort to help other victims to bring an end human trafficking. He has testified at a Texas legislative committee, which passed a state Anti-Trafficking Bill that provides justice for trafficking victims and prosecutes alleged traffickers. His story has been used as part of the Federal Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign and also helped create “Slavery Still Exists,” a national guide that has been distributed in numerous communities. Another narrative by Given can be found within the archive."
Given (Narrative 2),2012 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Zambia (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My parents’ death  Earliest memories My earliest memories of life begin in the early 1990’s. I remember feeling loved by both my mother and father. Even though my parents had separated, and were living in separate houses, dad used to come to our house where my six siblings and I lived with our mother.  I remember mom being a very reserved person. She had a few trusted friends in the neighborhood, but other than that she was not one to go out and try to be a social person. She was a strict disciplinarian. Every time I did something stupid and my mom found out, I was sure to get an African spanking. I was the youngest boy of my 2 older brothers and I also had two older sisters and one younger sister. So I was just about the right age for doing a lot of dumb things. Even though my mom was a strong disciplinarian and gave me a lot of spankings I still loved her and have a lot of fond memories of our short time together. My mom used to give what I call “scissors” haircuts. She would sit me between her two legs and give me a haircut. Even though I hated it at the time, it’s one of my fondest memories of me with my mother.  She used to sew everything by hand. If my pants had a hole in them my mom would patch it up. If I needed a sweater for school my mom bought cotton at the local market and sewed one for me instead of spending money to buy a new one. Today because of what I learned from my mother, if I buy new pants and they need hemming I just get a needle and thread from home and try to fix it myself. If my pants have holes in them, I patch them up by adding a new extra fabric from the inside of the pants. These are the things I learned from my mother that will stay with me during my life time on this earth. And now that I’m older and realize just how similar my reserved personality is to my moms, there is no doubt from whom I got my personality traits. My dad, unlike my mother, was more outgoing. He was a very social person and liked to hang out with his friends at the local market playing “so-olo”, a traditional African game that women hated because men lost lots of money on this additive game. My father was very caring to me and my siblings. Because we didn’t live in the same house after my parents’ divorce, sometimes a few days or even a whole week would go by without seeing him; in this case my father would hand money to my friends so they could give it to me when they saw me. Twice he came out to watch me play soccer with my friends at the local soccer field. One of the times I busted my big toe trying to impress to him with my soccer skills. In Africa, at least from what I remember, it is very unusual for parents to go watch their kids play soccer the number one sport in Zambia.  My father was passionate about school. He wanted to make sure all his kids got an education. One of the fondest memories with him was him walking me to school for my first day of the first grade and him telling me to stand up for myself if any one picks on me. When it was time for the show grounds my father always made sure we all had the money to go. He was known for his charisma and his nickname was “big vuduu” (someone who likes to stir things up). Even though we did not live in a fancy house, I still enjoyed my life at home. I enjoyed mom’s company at night. I enjoyed story telling times we had as a family. I remember one night not being able to go to sleep after my brother Cephas told the story that one day it will get dark and sun will never come out again. As a 4 or 5 year old I was terrified and couldn’t go to sleep that night. I enjoyed having brothers and sisters that I loved with my whole heart, and love at its core has never felt so good for me. My parent’s deaths Sometime in the early 1990’s when I was in the second grade at Kalingalinga primary school my mom became sick. She was taken to UTH (University Teaching Hospital of Zambia) hospital by several family members including my aunt Margret and others. When they returned from the hospital I just remember people crying and not knowing what was going on. My father came home that night and I remember him giving me a hug, telling me everything would be fine, and telling me to go to Aunt Margret’s house across the street to spend the night. Then in 1994, approximately 2 years after my mother had died, my father became sick while living with him Kalingalinga. Since we did not have enough money to take him to a modernized hospital, my father found a local witch doctor that prescribed him cultural herbs to drink every night as part of his treatment plan.  None of the treatment he was receiving from the witch doctors in Kalingalinga healed his hiccups or whatever other illness he was facing, so my grandmother suggested he come to the village where she was staying so she could care for him. My father was transported to Chongwe were he later died. I helped build his coffin behind grand moms’ African hut house.  He was buried in an open field village with a few other local villagers buried in that same location. We put a glass cup and metal plate on the ground to mark his grave site. Lessons learned The most difficult thing to deal with after my parents died was adjusting to life without them. How was I supposed to live in this world without people that I loved, idolized, admired, and trusted? Who was going to be there to defend me if I needed someone to stand up for me, who was going to make me feel as safe as I felt in my mother’s arms or dad’s conversations? Who was going to prepare my meals, wash my clothes, take me to the hospital, comb my hair, or go to school with me to pick up my school report? Having a little sister at home made me want to do something to help her because I did not want to see her suffer. When my parents were around I never thought or even dreamed about trying to find money to help her or any of my other siblings. After their deaths, I made a conscious decision to do whatever it took to make sure I could help her if she needed anything. Today I continue to work because I care for my brothers and sisters and the community which I left 13 years ago. How I adjusted Realizing the future was never going to be like the past, I vowed to myself to remain in school and try to do something to change my future. After school at night I sold paraffin in my compound of Kalingalinga going on foot from house to house shouting, “Paraffin” to earn some money.  During the day I crushed stones with a hammer laboring for weeks but only to sell that rock for 2 dollars after about 2 weeks’ worth of work. Other times I stood at the bus station waiting to carry produce for women coming from downtown who could not manage to carry their own stuff into compounds from the station. This was a tough job because I was competing with other kids who were a lot bigger than me and thus were more likely to charge in front of the line to get the job. In addition if goods weighed too much, the women picked someone that they knew could manage to carry it to their house without breaking down on the way. Who I lived with after parent’s deaths After my parents died my six siblings and I moved in with my aunt Margret in two her two room house with no electricity or running water. My aunt Margret was married and had six children including 3 boys and 3 girls. The living conditions were packed as we had 14 people trying to share a two room house. We slept right next to each other on the floor. Food was also scarce because no one had a financially stable job to support us. As a result each family member was expected to work and contribute whatever money he or she raked up doing piece work (part time jobs). One of the darkest moments of my life was after my sister Grace died and there was no money to help buy her coffin. So each family member was asked to go out before the funeral to find work so we could buy her a coffin. These early moments were defining moments for my life because they taught me how to be self sufficient. I learned that if I was going to make anything out of myself I had to work hard. Life is hard for any of us, but when you are an orphan you don’t know how to deal with it other than to live your life and try to survive in the circumstance that you found yourself.  Joining the choir and my Christian faith My Christian faith has carried me in both good and bad times. The day I accepted Jesus in Zambia I can remember going home from church wishing my life would end so I could go to heaven. My Christian faith has been the foundation upon which everything that has happened in my life has been built.  My Christian faith led me to joining the Zambian Acapella Boy’s Choir. Joining the choir was a life changing experience because it gave the peace and friendships I needed after being orphaned losing my parents and older sister. In addition it gave me the opportunity to come to the United States of America. And because of this I have been educated and have had the opportunity to help my Zambian family financially. I joined the choir at a time when I was spiritually lost. In Kalingalinga, I was hanging out with the wrong crowd and everything was falling down. Then in 1996 my cousins Richard and Mophat encouraged me to join the Zambian Acapella Boys’ Choir, ZABC 2.  I joined the choir after three weeks of preliminary church and choir rehearsal attendance. The normal waiting time was three months, but my persistence, hard-work, and commitment paid off. Joining the choir diverted my attention from hanging out with friends that were un-ambitious and had no goals in life.  Joining the choir brought back some of the inner peace I had lost after my parents died. On Sundays I enjoyed going to church Bible studies in the mornings and evenings. I enjoyed being picked to read the Bible verse in Sunday School.  Every Wednesday we also had evening Bible studies at various church members’ homes in the community which gave me the opportunity to get to know a lot of people.  When I was going through a hard time my friends from church prayed for me, this helped me recover from whatever struggle quickly because I knew I had people who cared.  When my oldest sister died in 1998 the choir came to my house and sang at the funeral. I was humbled to know that I mattered enough for them to come to my sister’s funeral to sing. With the Zambian Acapella Boy’s Choir, we sang at funerals in the community, went to various choir competitions, sang in church on Sundays; this gave me something to look forward to every single day of my life. At night I went to choir rehearsals after school. The church became such a part of my life I started sleeping there to save room at Aunt Margret’s house for someone else because of the crowded living conditions there. In a way, sleeping at the church meant we acted as guards protecting the church building from being broken into at night. At church we slept on wooden chairs as we organized 8 or 10 chairs side by side to form a bed shape sleeping area with no mattress. In addition because I started going to church, my family later became active members of Highland Baptist Church after I left Zambia. My aunts and cousins and many friends also began singing in the local church at Highland Baptist Church. The church has been in existence since the early 1990’s and has made many contributions to the community. While singing with the Zambian Acapella Boy’s Choir in Kalingalinga, I learned about other Zambian Acapella groups in the United States that were singing to raise funds for schools in Zambia. However, the extent of my knowledge of exactly what they were doing was limited. It was limited because I was not close friends with any choir members in the United States. However, the thought that I might get the same opportunity of going to America to sing to raise funds for disadvantaged children in my compound was an incredibly appealing thought to me. In Zambia many children dropped out of school because of the many economic challenges that they are faced with at home. Many of these children have to drop out of school to go fetch for money so they can feed themselves or help their siblings. At my elementary school in Kalingalinga I witnessed many friends with so much potential all the sudden stop coming to school because of the lack of support. Then in 1998 TTT, Partners in Education came to Zambia looking for a different choir to replace an older group after their 18 months tour in the United States was completed. I, of course, was ecstatic as the selection process began to pick 12 boys from a 64 member mass choir.  The selection process was based on the quality of voice, behavior, work ethic, none under the age of 12, and no related siblings. I made the cut although 2 other cousins competed for the same spot. After the selection process we practiced even harder to get ready for the upcoming tour. In addition we started gathering paper work to get ready for our trip. (I didn’t know at the time that it was unusual for visas etc to process so quickly. I now know the pockets of people were being padded to make things happen fast.) Every group member above the age of 16 was issued the Zambian Registration Card, equivalent to the American Social Security Card. After those were issued we then went to the Zambian Embassy to get our passports. Our families signed papers to release us to come to the United States. (All documents were written in English so none of us or our families really knew what the papers said). My passport said I was 11; they changed ages of choir members to make us appear to be younger). To parents the hopes of a better life far outweigh the risks of traveling far away and so they let their children go when the promises sound so good. Traffickers prey on the lack of education, language and communication barriers. Contractual agreements are confusing and futile. In Zambia, it is easy to convince people with hopes of a better life and future. Who would not want to come to America? When you live on less than a dollar per day, America is heaven. TTT, Partners in Education told us we were volunteers. They said our work would help build schools in Zambia, pay our families a monthly income, and give us a stipend and an American education while in the U.S. Our choir was specifically promised a school in Livingstone, Zambia. The school would be the place we would continue our education after finishing the tour in the United States. I now better understand why my choir never really knew what happened to ZABC 1 while they were on tour. (1996-1998) The ministry told us not to talk to any of those returned choir members “because they had been disobedient and disrespectful”.  They told the members of ZABC 1 in the US at the time that “the good choir was coming to replace them.” There was a ""line in the sand” drawn so we never talked to each other in the compound. The promises were deceptive and false. The school in Livingstone was never built. Our families received only 20 dollars a month for eighteen months. The only school we attended in the United States was after 9 months being on tour and the American government forced the ministry to provide the education. We did not receive the promised salary. We did not know where all of the money was going that we saw in love offerings and selling CD’s. If I inquired about money or school, Bible scriptures on obedience and respect were embellished to shame me. In  the United States,  we  were not  allowed  to visit  with  any of  the other choirs from our community even though we were friends and some members had brothers in another choir. Our bags and clothes were searched after each tour. We were not allowed to have any person’s (especially host families where we stayed while on tour) contact information. We had no contact with our families.  We were not allowed to keep our own passports. We could not complain to anyone about anything except to the ministry. Such complaining brought threats of deportation, being sent home disgracing our families.  We were the promise of hope when we were selected to be in the choir and people expected a lot from us when our tour was over. We were not allowed to have pocket money. We sang 4 -7 concerts a day. After each concert we asked for a love offering and sold CDs. If a choir member could not sing because of sickness he was seen as disobedient and was threatened with deportation (sent home in disgrace meaning bringing shame to your family). We had been warned against escaping because we would be caught and deported. Many days we woke around 4:30 a.m. to travel to sing.  I remember one time feeling so exhausted that I just sat down to rest.   The trafficker came over to me and stood me up holding my shirt collar saying, “Sing boy, I told you to sing.” His voice was full of anger and I was scared. At the home base,  we  cooked and did  laundry regardless of how excruciating our  schedule was. Our suffering was both psychological and physical. TTT asked if we would like to have a swimming pool at home base.  When we replied favorably, we were forced to help hand dig a swimming pool with picks and shovels in July Texas heat. Sometimes I felt like a puppet on string being moved around. We sang in churches, schools and malls. We sang an estimate of 20 concerts a week. My passport said I was 11 and this was exhausting work. In April of 1999, the main TTT person died and his daughter and son-in-law carried on the “ministry”. After a few weeks, TTT contacted the police and then immigration to have 4 choir members removed in April 1999.  Besides losing my parents, seeing my friends in handcuffs being harassed was one of the most uncertain and scariest moments of my life. I was scared because I didn’t know if my fate would be the same. Only a few days after the four boys had been picked up, the remaining seven of us decided to stay in the United States. It was better to keep hope than face the scrutiny and shame of returning to Zambia without anything. The United States Department of Labor got involved and demanded the ministry pay us. A lawsuit was filed on behalf of 67 choir members for $500,000. TTT, Partners in Education then began to furnish a monthly income, but retained most of our money for our expenses, such as house rent, school, electricity, food, and my airline ticket home. I had about forty dollars per month left. In January 2000 we demanded the money that TTT owed us. We were tired of the threats, the grueling schedule, and the lack of meals (the gas stove was turned off so we could not cook if we refused to sing). We made a group decision to go home rather than being deported. It seemed better for our reputation. The same INS agent that picked up our 4 friends came to pick us up and I was rescued and taken to First Baptist Church in Colleyville, Texas. I was then given the opportunity to stay in the United States of America on deferred action status to testify against my traffickers if necessary. I’m thankful to the INS for giving me the opportunity of the life I have today. Although this experience did not turn out to be what I thought, it taught a good lesson in life, to always be optimistic about life and persevere. Life is a challenge for all of us, but it is how we chose to deal with it that matters. Although  it did not turn out to be what I wanted, I thank God it happened because it gave me the opportunity to witness to people in the United States about Jesus Christ and in the process, many people learned about Zambia. As a result many missionaries from the United States and elsewhere in the world have gone to Zambia on mission trips because of the work of Zambian Acapella Choirs. Coming to USA In the year 2000 after we parted ways with TTT Partners in Education, we had nowhere to go. When the INS agent, Sal Orrantia, who was investigating the ministry, came to pick us up from the ministry, he was going to put us in jail if he could not find a place for us to stay. Mr. Orrantia had somehow heard about the people at First Baptist Colleyville Church and their involvement with the Zambian Acapella Choirs. Mr. Orrantia contacted the church to see if they would be interested in hosting 7 boys for an unspecified amount of time. Mr. Orrantia spoke to Neal Choate, and Neal Choate called my now mom Sandy Shepherd. That same night, the seven of us boys ended up to the Shepherd’s house in Colleyville. My father was out of town on a business trip and Shelly was a senior in high school. At the Shepherd’s house we were scared because we did not know who to trust and had no idea what the ministry could try to do. Sandy had volunteered with TTT for 2 years but had not seen my choir perform.  She had tried but had not been able to convince authorities, even the FBI, that the ministry was not treating us right. Sandy called a few of her friends to come over to her house our first night there to help make us feel more comfortable and protect herself  from seven boys  whom she didn’t know much about. Every night she set the house alarm fearing the TTT employees might come and retaliate with our moving from their ministry. Out of concern for our safety, my mom began calling people from the church to see if they could host the guys temporarily. Within a few weeks she found temporary homes for all 7 boys. Later she found permanent houses for all the boys which was a grueling process to get people to commit to keeping a boy on a permanent basis of whom they did know much about. In a few cases some of the boys flew out to these families house for a week to see if things would work out before the final move. In addition it took lots of time and energy for my mother on the phone calling these families and convincing them to agree.    During our time in Colleyville, Sandy took us to the mall and found part times jobs for us around the community. She would drive us to these part time jobs and later come to pick us up. She bought all of our food, paid for gas, and all of the other expenses we had. She drove us to down town Dallas to file for adjustment of status from P3 visa to deferred action status, helped get paper work processed and stood by us as we all got required immunizations. She helped us write our required depositions which was an emotionally draining process for most of the boys. Eventually I went to live in Childress, Texas with my cousin Richard but later returned to visit the Shepherd house after my cousin Richard left Childress. While on this visit to the Shepherd’s house, Donna Korthals, the lady I was living with in Childress wrote me a letter saying she could not  keep  me  anymore  because  of  her  health  reasons. It  was  during  this  time  that  the Shepherd’s offered me the opportunity to stay and enroll in school since I was young and needed a place to be. My understanding was that this was not a permanent offer. It depended on how everything would work out.  Never the less, I was humbled by the offer and decided to work my tail off in school so I could succeed. Joining the Zambian Acapella Boy’s Choir was a life changing experience because it gave me the opportunity to come to the United States of America.   In the United States I have been educated and have been blessed with a new American family. And in return, I have been able to help my Zambian family financially. Coming to the United States has given me an American family which has embraced me and given me the love and support I have always been looking for. My American mom, Sandy Shepherd, helped me with my school home work after I arrived in her home in the 8th  grade.   Together we have shared speaking about human trafficking to countless media outlets. She has been a source of emotional support when countless other challenges have risen. My American father, Deetz Shepherd, has been also a source of encouragement over the years. He has had a listening ear and has been non-judgmental through my ups and downs. Together we have enjoyed talking sports for years. And now he has been encouraging me by walking me through several Bible studies. My American sisters Kyla, Christi, and Shelly have all been wonderful. They have all embraced me as their young brother. At every family gathering they have been incredibly engaged and are always asking me questions about school and how I’m doing. In addition, Kyla has been great about sharing her 4 boys with me, many times inviting me to her house to play with the kids. She has on several occasions brought the boys to visit my dorm room when I was in college. In times of difficulty she has called me to check and see how things we going. I began school in the 8th grade at Colleyville Middle School in 2000. My English was limited and emotionally I was home in Zambia wanting to see my family.  Before school started my mom arranged a meeting with the school principal. In the meeting she explained to the principal my background and everything that had happened to me. The principal prayed for me at the end of the meeting and vowed to help me in any way I needed. Before school started my mom took me shopping for new school clothes, a back pack, books, shoes, socks, lunch box, pencils, pens, and more. She then left town to help my sister Shelly, her youngest daughter, move into her dorm room at Baylor. So her friend Roxanne took me to school for my first day of class.  From that moment on she took me to school every morning and came  to  pick  me  up  afterwards.  In  the  morning  she  fixed  me  lunch  and  made  sure  my homework was done on time.  She went to all the parent meetings at school and encouraged me to participate in student activities such as joining the school choir at Colleyville Middle School. In the evening my mom helped me with my reading and writing homework. My father helped me with my math homework. English classes were extremely tough for me given my Zambian educational background. So reading a novel and trying to extrapolate what it was saying was tough and it took me many hours doing it on my own. Writing stories on these novels was also a challenge.   So my teachers told me to start writing about my experience in Zambia, or what it was like coming on the plane from Zambia. Or what the villages looked like in Zambia. That was helpful. Eventually, however, I resented them giving me lesser work or different work just to pass my classes. I wanted to be the doing the same thing every kid was doing. I told mom not to tell my teachers about my Zambian background because I wanted them not to know me for being from Africa, but for being a student just trying to do his best to pass his classes like everyone else. My parent’s patience in me paid off. In 2001 I graduated from Colleyville Middle School and enrolled at Grapevine High School. My biological parents never went past the 7th  grade, so I was happy knowing my studies would have made them proud. In high school my mom did they same thing she did in middle school, giving me a package to take to each of my teachers so they could understand my background. Again I resented doing this because I didn’t want them treating me any differently from everyone else because of my background. All I wanted was not to be treated different because of my background. As a freshman I joined the school soccer team and played for 3 seasons. Most games were played in winter season and my parents came to support me regardless of the weather. My junior and senior year I joined the cross country team because my best friend Josh from middle school was also running. In addition I was trying to increase my speed for soccer so I could get more playing time. Academically, I guess like most high school students, I did as little as I could do to get by. There was no Zambian role model for me to model my life after or try to emulate in my educational endeavors. In 2005 I graduated from high school and decided to become a predental student after reading a classroom brochure in high school. I decided to start taking school seriously again because I realized I was slowly becoming an adult and if I didn’t work hard then I wouldn’t have a future to rely on. In August of 2003 during my sophomore year in high school I received my T Visa, a victim of human trafficking, now with permission to remain in the United States. That paper work meant that I was secure in my status as long as I followed the rules of the INS and was not committing any crimes.  I was no longer in limbo and could actually begin to see my future ahead of me. An angel named Dolly Warden sat on my shoulder as I struggled waiting for this valuable visa. She encouraged me through each step of the application process and rejoiced with me when I received my T Visa. My American family’s support has been unyielding and straightforward.  They have included me in every family holiday planning. In addition I have been included in every family picture portrait as if I was I no different. My family in Zambia has received financial support including building a house for my brother Cephas to share with his family.  My young sister, nephews, and nieces have some education because of the support my American family gives me. My brother rents part of the house they helped build for him so he could have some monthly income to support his family. My family supported my younger sister Doreen through her pregnancy by sending her to a better trained doctor in Lusaka although the baby still died. It takes money, commitment, and lots of caring to raise a child to be a champion in life. I consider myself  a champion not in an elegant way but in  a thankful way to  what I have accomplished given my background. Today I’m in dental school because of the support I have received from my American mom and dad. In my journey to get to dental school my family bought me my first computer in college which helped me do my homework. They moved me to my first dorm at Stephen F. Austin which was 4 hours away from Colleyville.  They bought my dorm room carpet to make my room comfortable and took me shopping for all the things I could have ever needed to have a successful start to my college career. During Home Coming they drove to Nacogdoches and gave me spending money if needed to get something to eat. When I decided to transfer from Stephen F. Austin to Tarrant County Community College after my freshman year at Stephen F. Austin they welcomed me back into their home with open arms. I graduated from UNT in 2008 with a Biology degree and began applying for dental school. I was the first college graduate in my extended Zambian family and I know my biological mom and dad would have been so proud of me. After graduating from UNT mom helped me with my application for dental school. Applying to dental school was an incredible task that required lots of  time and money gathering  all the information dental  schools  look  for  in  the  admission process. My American family paid for me to take the dental admission exam twice because I did poorly the first time I took it. They paid for my monthly auto insurance bills, phone bills, and gas money for my automobile which they gave to me during my sophomore year in high school. They helped me find my first apartment in Dallas. They helped set up my new apartment and bought my bed, pillows, blankets, couch, TV, washing machine, silver wear, etc. They bought a new laptop computer which was required for school. The support I have received is immeasurable and the only way to ever repay back is by doing the same to someone else in need. Someone whom you know, if you don’t do anything to help them, they may never reach their full potential in life because of the lack of resources. Finishing dental school will enable me to help my country and many other people as I have always wanted. Thanks to my entire American family (especially my mom) for their support, my dream is only 4 years away from being fully realized. Finishing college The reason I triumph in my achievement to finish college is because it’s something I never dreamed would be mine. Growing up in Zambia my goal in life was to finish twelfth grade education and find a job, get married and be happy. That all changed when I met a loving family that was willing to support me through my education years. College taught to plan to sleep and wake up on time in order to be a successful student. It taught me to study extra hours on Friday nights in the library in order to successfully pass my classes. In addition, college taught me to push extra hard to get out of my bed when sleeping in felt like a better choice than going to that early morning class. Furthermore I learned it was okay to miss out on my favorite sporting events in order to accomplish my school related tasks. I also learned to act and behave in a professional way in my dealings with college professors and student colleagues. Finishing college gave me the opportunity to apply to dental school and be accepted at Baylor College of Dentistry. When I finish dental school I will be able to serve the community and give back just as much has been given to me. The decision I made from a pamphlet could lead to a lifetime of happiness by being able to give back to the community and the poor populations. I’ve been told that many of us will have outstanding loans finishing dental school. In order for those loans to be “forgiven”, you can go to work for the American government and work in what is considered less desirable places. I would love to be a prison dentist. I have done prison ministry and I think that would be a good fit for me to repay my loans. Finishing college gave me a different perspective on life. It’s made me realize life does not evolve around what I have been raised to know. It’s made me realize there are many different cultures and each one is unique and each one and has good and bad. Interacting with my Asian friends in college made me see into their culture. The same with my Indian friends, white friends, gay friends or what have you. Growing up in Zambia as a child, I remember it being common amongst my friends to make fun of other cultures or ethnicity not realizing the same could be done to us by other cultures. Finishing college gave me hope about my future.  Although my SAT scores were poor, knowing that I could still graduate from college on time and pursue another dream was incredibly uplifting for my dreams. In addition, although I didn’t have the finances to go to college I knew if I studied hard enough everything would fall in place. Although I knew it was going to be hard to stay away from my Zambian family for another 4 years, I knew everything would be fine in the end. My faith in God carried me through those hard times. College taught me about perseverance. In my first biology class in college I earned a failing grade. But instead of giving up I decided to purge forward by working harder so the same thing would not happen again. My first semester grades at Stephen F Austin were, D in Zoology, A in English, B in math, B in history, and B in communications. The next semester I signed up for a chemistry course, along with English II, Algebra I, and Music Appreciation. The chemistry class was going to be my deciding factor for pursing forward in my dental pursuit. If I received the same letter grade in this course as I did in zoology then I would have to change my major and find something that was more suited to my skills. Not wanting to divert from my dream, I promised myself to study for as long as I could and study whatever and whenever I could to make sure I passed that class. So I went to every study group session offered by the university. I attended every class, did every homework assignment, and came out of the class with an impressive C. After the semester was over, I drove home from Stephen F. Austin for 4 hrs singing praise to God for my accomplishment.  Receiving a C in chemistry meant I could remain with my pursuit to dental school. Receiving a C in that chemistry class gave me a little of bit of hope, and that little bit of hope was all I needed to remain motivated.  On my way home from Stephen F. Austin after the semester was over, I drove home to Colleyville singing praise to my Lord. I was so excited I even got a speeding ticket. In my other classes I received a B in English 2, B in Algebra, and A in Music Appreciation. As you can see my grades were never stellar but it was my hard work that got me the grades I got and I’m glad I worked hard to achieve my goals.  After spending a year at Stephen F. Austin I transferred to Tarrant County Community College closer to home. Driving back and forth between Nacogdoches and Colleyville was becoming more and more daunting, and the weight of being alone on a college campus forced me to make the decision to return home to get additional support from my parents. I spent a year at Tarrant County Community College and took General Chemistry II, Organic Chemistry I, Biology I, and other science classes and managed an impressive 3.0 GPA. My journey to get to where I’m today has been a slow and progressive journey, but it has taught me a lot about hard work and perseverance. In 2007 I transferred to the University of North Texas in Denton where I found my perfect college campus. The diversity of  the college enabled me to learn about a lot of  different ethnicities and cultures. In addition the University of North Texas in Denton was only a 45 minute drive away from home, which meant I could go home on the weekends and spend time with my family and friends in Colleyville. Academically I improved a lot as I learned new techniques to study. My best semester was fall 2007 when I had a 3.99 GPA while taking Microbiology,  Organic Chemistry,  Calculus,  and Principles  of  Nutrition.  It  was  my greatest achievement academically because it took a lot of energy and focus for me to manage such a schedule. I graduated from the University of North Texas in 2009 with a degree in a BA in Biology and 3.2 overall GPA, not bad for a kid who didn’t even know he would ever get a chance to even be in college as a child.  In June 2009, I finally received the promised permanent residence card after waiting for years. With this new status, I knew I could finally return to Zambia to see my family and come back to the US to continue my education. My American family purchased a ticket for me to go home to visit my Zambian family for the first time in 11 years for Christmas of 2009. It was one of the best moments of my life because I got to share my favorite holiday with my Zambian family. In addition I found the entire family in good health and living a relatively better life than they would be if I never came to the United States. Speaking about human trafficking Human trafficking is an atrocity that affects 27 million people around the world with an estimated 14,000-15,000 brought to the United States each year. If the general public does understand this vicious occurrence, then the problem will get much bigger and became even more of a challenge to eliminate. My journey to testifying about human trafficking began when I was in high school. In 2003, I was invited to speak to the Committee on Jurisprudence regarding a Texas state law to punish human traffickers. I agreed to testify and my mom, dad and I drove to Austin Texas to make our contribution. While there mom and I met Kevin Bales, founder of Free the Slaves, a pioneering organization in the fight against modern day slavery. Kelvin Bales encouraged me to use my story to educate the public so we could help to eliminate modern day slavery. At the time I didn’t really understand his reasoning but today I appreciate Kevin for all the work he has done to help eliminate modern day slavery from the world and for helping me understand how my story could help change the public awareness. When I stood in front of the jurisprudence committee to tell my story, I was nervous because it was the first time I’d stood in front of an American audience without performing in choir format with which I was comfortable.  I remember after I finished speaking one of the chair ladies on the committee thanking me for sharing my story and telling me how courageous I was for doing what I did. She asked me where I went to school and just acted very nicely to make me feel welcomed.  After  the  speech  a  camera  man  approached  me  and  was  asking  me  further questions about my story for the local news. All I could do was explain my experience and nothing more. Speaking to that committee opened doors that I never were possible nor sought. Since that day I have shared my story with many with conventions, churches, schools, TV programs, newspapers, magazines and various other media outlets. In part because of the work we have done, many other states in the country have adapted anti-trafficking laws. In return I have been blessed with scholarships which have helped me go to school and further my education. My mom would do the research to find these scholarships and together we would write the community service based scholarship essays. Some of the scholarships I have been awarded  include  Prudential  Spirit  of  Community  National  Award-  awarded  by  Prudential Financial and National Association of Secondary Principals, National Award  – awarded by Yoshiyama  Hitachi  Foundation,  Ronald  McDonald  Future  Achievers  for  Black  Students  – awarded by Ronald McDonald House Charities, “20 Teens Who Will Change the World” – Teen People Magazine, Field Scovell Award – awarded by the Field Scovell Foundation and more.  Of all the speaking we have done we have never asked to be compensated for our work except for transportation or accommodation expenses. We feel led that such stories should not be told for a profit but rather free to help the public understand this atrocity. It requires many voices to help  get  rid  of  such  an  atrocity  as  human  trafficking.  In  cases  where  we  have  been compensated we asked that that money be donated to an organization such as Free the Slaves or J.O. Chifundo, a school my mom helped open in Kalingalinga, my home community. Furthermore, I think our work has been beneficial in helping people in Zambia understand what modern day slavery is. Few choirs have left Zambia to come to the United States under false pretenses since we started speaking because the American Embassy in Zambia has been more careful in insuring visas to choirs coming to the United States to perform. Unfortunately, this has created resentment towards me from other choirs wanting to come to the United States and former choir members who did not get to remain in the US.  However, I firmly believe I have been doing the right thing. I support other culture choirs coming to sing in the US, but not under the pretense of a good cause with trafficked persons behind the scenes. I believe if I can prevent even one person from being trafficked into the United States, that person will have been prevented from having to face the many challenges that victims of human trafficking face. I am a very blessed young man and know my journey has not been nearly as painful as hundreds of thousands of victims of this horrible crime. My family has not been threatened; I was not physically beaten, maimed or burned. I am still alive. So many victims will never realize survivorship because of the nature of their destroyed and stolen lives. They will be forever broken and scarred and this is why we must put an end to this global crisis.  No one should be able to earn money for the work of another and people should be paid fairly for their work. As David Batstone says, “I am not for sale, you are not for sale, no one should be for sale.”","Given was brought to the United States from Zambia at 11 to work as part of a boys’ choir. He was promised an education and pay for his work, but instead was exploited and enslaved. Rescued by the U.S Citizenship and Naturalization Services (INS) in 2000, Given speaks out about his experience in an effort to help other victims to bring an end human trafficking. He has testified at a Texas legislative committee, which passed a state Anti-Trafficking Bill that provides justice for trafficking victims and prosecutes alleged traffickers. His story has been used as part of the Federal Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign and also helped create “Slavery Still Exists,” a national guide that has been distributed in numerous communities. Another narrative by Given can be found in the archive."
Goma,2002 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Forced labour Forced marriage,Nepal (trafficked from) Forced labour Forced marriage,Nepal (slavery location),"I don’t know exactly how many years I’ve been in Kathmandu, maybe 13… I ran away with my village friends. At that time I was not yet 15. My friends said it would be good. We could weave carpets, roam around, and enjoy ourselves in Kathmandu city. We would not have to work hard, like in the village, where we did household chores, farming, collection of fodder and firewood, and cleaning the cow shed. How could Kathmandu really be as they described? The factory owners did not pay us for three years. Nor did they give us any clothes. Many of those who were working with me returned home. They did not let me go. In the carpet factory they first take you to the proprietor. They keep you to train you. For three months they do not pay any money. Only food is given in the morning and evening, that’s all. Even after I had learnt to weave carpets, the instructor took my salary. When I demanded it, he beat me. For three years I didn’t go home. I didn’t even have 25 paisa. How to go from there? There was no one to ask on my behalf for the money I had earned. As they found I couldn’t speak out they dominated me, and I used to fall ill at times… “You’re always falling ill,” they scolded. And if they spent 300 rupees on medicine then they inflated that to 1,000 rupees and billed me accordingly. They used to say, “Your debt is more than what you get from working,” and they didn’t pay me anything. I left once but that woman brought me back and beat me. After getting a lot of beating I really bit her hand and she stopped. “I have taught you and you cannot go to another place,” she said. Finally I managed to run away from that place with great difficulty. I went to Kalanki carpet factory and out of nowhere my elder sister’s father-in-law arrived. My relatives talked here and there, and married me off to a boy from Kavre district. It is in the hills. I had never seen that boy before… I knew him one week before the marriage. My husband used to weave carpet on the same loom. At that time I thought that boy might be good. He was young and I was also young. At times I wonder why I came and started to learn weaving carpets. I used to get excited hearing about Kathmandu. As it was our capital, we really imagined it to be a beautiful place…When we first arrived, wherever you looked, lights were glittering. Wherever you looked, big, big buildings…gleaming motorcars. It was enjoyable… In the beginning, the idea was to earn some money in a year or two and go home… Now life is gone, it’s gone for nothing. Just problem after problem. I cannot sleep the whole night, thinking about it.","Goma was enslaved in her home country of Nepal as a teenager, after running away with friends to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. She was made to weave carpet without pay and beaten when she asked for the money she earned. According to the Global Slavery Index, within Nepal, forced labour and debt bondage persist, particularly within the agriculture, forestry, construction, and manufacturing sectors. Many Nepalese are trapped into exploitative situations by borrowing money from lenders, who then force borrowers to work to repay their debt. As in Goma’s case, those in debt bondage do not have the freedom to work for another employer without the landlord’s permission, and are subjected to working long hours for wages below the minimum wage. Individuals who eventually pay off their debt are at risk of falling back into modern slavery, due to limited alternative job opportunities. Studies also indicate that forced marriage and the marriage of those under 15 years old continues."
Helia,2007 (Narrative date) ,Domestic slavery,Haiti (trafficked from),Haiti (slavery location),"My name is Helia Lajeunesse. I was someone whose mother died when I was seven months old and left me as a tiny baby. My grandmother took me in because my father, when he impregnated my mother, he left. And my grandmother took care me from that time until I was about five years old. Then my grandmother died. And then a neighbor took me in. I was five years old when the neighbors took me in. But then I had to do all the work in their house. I had to go and get water even though I was so little I couldn’t do anything really, but they decided that I should be the one to doing that work. I had to sweep the whole house, and I had to do all the dishes. They showed me how to cook food, but it was my own food that I cooked because when they made food for themselves, they didn’t give me any of that. I was the one that went to bed the latest, and I was the one who got up first. As soon as it was four o’clock, I had to be on my feet to go and sweep the kitchen and to light the fire and wash all the dishes and put the water on for coffee. When they would make their coffee they said I couldn’t do it because they said I wasn’t clean enough to do it. And they would make coffee, but they wouldn’t give me any – they would just drink it with their own children. Then they would tell me that I had to go behind the breadfruit tree to make my own food. Sometimes the children of the house would hit me on my head even when I didn’t do anything. And sometimes the children would set it up so that one would take the money of the other, and they would say that I was the one that took it. All the children in this neighborhood were in school. There were four of them. But she said she wasn’t going to put me in school because I was just an animal without any family. I stayed there because I didn’t have anywhere else to go. I didn’t know anybody in my mother’s family till I was about eight or nine years old. There is a marketplace that was very far away, so then I had to put a basket on my head and go very far and sell in that village, so that I would bring back all the provisions for them. But the road for me to leave that marketplace to go back was very far. And after I had finished selling, they said I can only get ten cents out of the profit. But there was a type of bread that would sell four for fifteen cents, and they would just give me three for ten cents. And then to eat just that so that I would to go all the way back home - it wasn’t very close. And then she would have me do a lot of different errands, but the money she made off of the sales wasn’t enough. She would say that I had eaten the profits instead of doing what she had asked me to do. They would have horses that they had saddles for. She wouldn’t saddle a horse for me. She said I had to carry it on my own head. There was water very far away, and I had to go down and get the water. It was very far down below a mountain. And I had to walk very far, very steep. And the clothes I had, if they got torn, she wouldn’t buy anything new for me. But I had other neighbors that looked, and they would say to the woman, “Adeline, you should take care of her just like she was your own child.” She would say, “Oh! I should take care of her like any of my other child of my own? No she’s just an animal without any family.” But they say, “No, even though she’s not your own child, you should take care of her like she’s any other child because maybe tomorrow when she could do something for you she will say thank you to you too.” But she’d say, “What’s that going to be useful for me? What could she learn for herself that she could take care of herself?” I just stayed there, and I was in a lot of misery. And I was just barefoot too. And then when I was eleven years old, no ten, there was a school that they closed in with some coconut leaves. The man who was making that school were close to the house. The children of this woman went to the good Catholic school. [The man would say,] “Adeline, this child, we don’t need any money for her to go to school because you say she’s just an animal of the family. So all you have to do is buy a little milk. We’ll help her as family.” And so she said, “I should buy a notebook? What she’s supposed to do with the notebook? When you have people like this that have no family, they’re just like animals. We should just treat them like animals.” The teacher would say, “That’s not something that you should say because you have children.” But she didn’t agree. And so one day she went away into the city, and her children were old enough they were going to be baptized. One day when she was going to be gone for three days, one day when I was washing the dishes in the kitchen, and the man called me “Helia!” and [I] responded, “Yes, Mister.” And he said when you’re done doing the dishes, come to me under the little shade house. The teacher said “Come out, and while Adeline isn’t here, you can come and learn a little bit like zeros and things.” And for those three days when Adeline was gone, I sat there under the shade house with this teacher. And when Adeline came back from the city, I didn’t see that she was coming, and so when she got there and I saw her, I got up and ran away.  I went inside. She asked me what I was doing. “You think you need school?”  “No it wasn’t me. It was the teacher who called me.” And so she beat me all up, and she said, “So when you learn to read what’s that going to be useful for you?” And she whipped me with a whip, and she opened my skin, so then I never learned again. I stayed there, and I went through a lot of misery.  And then there was a neighbor that said, “I’m going to get you out of this. I’m going to put you in another neighbor’s house.” But I said, “No, I don’t know where that is. Leave me where I am. Let me go through this with my courage.” And then one day she started to have an argument about me, and she said, “Oh! You’re treating this child like an animal. You’re the one that’s an animal!” And she said, “You don’t even give her your clothes, or the food you cook for your own children you don’t give to her.” And so she told the school. The little school had a catechism class, and it was for everyone. And so when the lady invited me to go to catechism class, I said, “No, I can’t because Adeline is going to beat me.” And so the ladies of the neighborhood put a lot of pressure on Adeline. They told her if she would beat this little girl, they were going to call the police or burn her house. And then when she saw that, they let me go to the catechism class.  And then when they had tests, I went to the test for my catechism, and I passed it for the first communion. And she said “Oh! I’m going to have to give you a communion? And because they pressured me, intimidated me, said they’re going to burn my house, I guess I’m going to have to give you a first communion.” Then I was eleven years old. But the day of the communion, she took a dress that had three different kinds of fabric in it, and I wore that to the communion service. All the children had parents. They were so pretty. But I went to church with this dress and barefoot. And all the other children had nice shoes, and I was the only one barefoot. And when I left church and went home – as soon as I got home she told me to take that dress off and put that old rag on. And then I did that, and she told me to get the board, which is a calabash, to go and get water in it. And the sun was so hot. And then when I was coming back with the water, there was another child that was in the same communion service. And the mother of that child saw me; she cried. “Oh what a pity!” That day I remember very well because she said, “Oh! How hard it is for a child that doesn’t have a mother!” And then she called me; she gave me a little food of the party food of the other child. And there was some lady that saw that, and she told Adeline that I went and that I was eating at somebody else’s, and then Adeline beat me up. She said that I had gone and gossiped, so they gave me food. I told her, “No. It wasn’t me. It was because the lady saw me, and she offered me the food.” And I told Adeline that “You know, today I am just little, but I know that there is a God, and one day I know that he’ll say something for me.”  And so I stayed there. Then all these people that came from Port-au-Prince, they said they’re going to take with them, and I said, “No, I don’t know where that is. I can‘t go there because this is what I know. Even if I stay here and she kills me, I’m going to stay here.” All the things that she did to me, I just stayed there. When she would beat me, I would say, “No. You have children. Even though my grandmother left me here with you, it wasn’t to beat me like this.” And she said, “Oh! So now you’re starting to talk back to me? Oh, and you want to take my husband away from me?” I said, “No, I would never do that. Even though I just get a little food here, but you give me a place to sleep. Even when you don’t give me the food that you to give to your other children, at least I have a place to sleep here.” And then one day I saw that I just couldn’t stand it any longer. There was a woman from town, and I said, “I’m going to go with you because I can’t stand it any longer.” And so when I came to understand that she was offering me her husband, I couldn’t stay there any longer. And I got up and left. So one day when she went out I took the clothes that she gave me – not the clothes from the communion – but I got the clothes that she had given me, and I ran away. And so the lady told me where she was going to be waiting for me, and I found her there. I thought it was a good thing that I was doing, but I should have stayed at Adeline’s house. So I got to the second person, then I was twelve years old. So I had to get up early because she was doing a lot of commerce, this woman. She had a restaurant; she needed food. So then I had to get up really early because I was the one who cleaned all the pots and the pans for the restaurant, and then I had to get to the marketplace. She used to hire people to work for her, but then since I was there in her house, she didn’t have to hire anybody any more. Then I had to light the fire. Had to do all these things. She was the one that would put oil in the pot, but then I had to do everything else. But to know if there was enough salt, I had to bring her a spoonful so she would taste it to know if it was correct, enough salt. And after she sold all the food, she would tell me that I can scrape the pot to eat. I left because I was so bad, and now I’ve gotten worse off. But there was a woman who said, “Now you’re old enough. You could probably work for yourself.” There was another woman that was living across from this woman I was working for, and she saw the misery I was going through. And she told me that when I was old enough I can make a living myself, and I said yes, because when I need some clothes, I need to be able to buy them myself. I always had the hope that somebody would deliver me. I always had that hope. Because I believe that not everybody can be the same way. So I spent two years at this woman’s house with the restaurant. And so the woman said, now I was fourteen, I can work for myself. And so I asked her to go look for some work for me. This is the other woman has said I can work. And so she found some work for me. And so then I was working for nine Haitian dollars, at forty-five gourdes a month [$1]. And I would make food, and I would wash clothes, and I’d iron, and I’d carry water, and I did the marketing. The woman I was working for had two children, and I was taking them to school. And then at noon, I had to go back and get them. And so I thought it wasn’t too bad.  Even though I would feel tired, when I was able to get forty-five gourdes, I could buy some sandals or a dress with it. So I stayed there, and I stayed there, and I spent six years there. And so they treated me well because they saw that I liked children, and they really took care me. Even though they gave me forty-five gourdes, sometimes if they saw a brand new pair of panties, they would buy it for me. And so I spent six years there, until I was twenty. And why did I leave? One day when I went and got one of the kids from school – at that time the child was four – so I was walking the street, holding her hand, and I just passed the priest’s house. The child fell down while I was holding her, and so her leg got scraped up. And the woman that I was working for called the police. She said that I scarred her child. “It wasn’t my fault, Madame Danielle, because while I was holding her hand and she tripped and she fell. To be spending six years of this, it is not now that I would do something to hurt them.” And all the people around said, “How is it, after six years, that you would do this? You would make the police come and beat her too?” And she said, “Oh! I am working so hard for my own children. If my children have a scar, they’re not going to be able to do what they want to do. If they want to leave, they can’t leave.” And so one day I saw that there was someone that was going back out to the countryside, I decided that I wasn’t going to stay there any longer, and I would go with them.  So I went to a place called the town [unintell]... a place very, very far from the town of Jérémie, that’s on the southern peninsula. So then this person took me to this place very far. They weren’t my family. So I went there, and so then I bought a machete, and I started making a garden just like a man. When they had coffee and needed to harvest, I’d go out and get coffee. And those places, they would pay you for a day’s work in the garden and they would buy coffee from you. Sometimes they’d pay you for a day’s work but they’d just give you a can of coffee for payment.  I stayed there, and I worked for people and I just stayed, and then I found a man who loved me. And he wanted to know my family, and I said, “Well, God put me on this earth; I don’t have any family.” But his parents liked me a lot, and so I stayed with them. And I had a child, and so the parents of the man got mad at me because I had this child. And then I didn’t know where I was going to go, and then I was really having lots of misery then. I was just perishing. And this man had a brother here. When his brother came to visit, I was the one that washed and cleaned for him. And his brother sent word to a brother-in-law of his in Port-au-Prince. At that time, to get a boat from Jérémie, it cost fifty gourdes, and they sent seventy-five gourdes to me. And they said that they would pay for the boat trip, and then the rest would be for food…. I was passing so much misery because I was living with my husband’s mother. And it was so bad that his brother saw that and sent for me to come into Port-au-Prince. And he lived in the area called Cite Soleil, and then he went to the area of Matisse, and I stayed with them. And I still live with my brother-in-law, his wife, and his child. And then I had another two children at his house. And then my husband came. They rented a house together like a family, and we had one room in their house. 1994, 95, 96 time. One night while I was sleeping with my husband and my three children, I heard a knock on my door, but I didn’t open it. That should be my husband knocking on the door, but he’s with me, so I don’t have anybody else. And I saw that they knocked the door in. So these people had black masks over their faces, so you couldn’t see their faces. They asked “Oh! You didn’t open the door?” And I said, “No, Why should I open the door? I don’t know anybody outside. My husband is here with me.” There were several that came. There were three that raped me. When they were finished, they took my husband, and to this day I don’t know where he went. And then my brother-in-law left that area, and I left too and went to another place and stayed with people. And then I had a lot of troubles because I had nobody to give me anything to help me. And so then I found a man who was already married, but he said he would take me, but I wouldn’t have chosen that, but for my children I did. And then I had a child for him. And we had no problems, really; he helped me when I needed something. And I left with my children. And then there was a woman that went and told the wife of this man, and she brought him to my house. And so that wife…every day she would come to my house, and she would swear and persecute me, and so she would come every day and scream and holler and give me problems every day. And so I decided I’ve already gone through two stages of life. If God’s going to give me something, I’ll take it. But I can just at least do little job, wash somebody’s clothes, maybe give me a little food, and I can share with my children. And rather I’d not have anything but have peace with my children. And so the man left. And so I told him that, “Now that I have two children for you, if you remember them, send something for them through another person. I don’t need to have anything to do with you anymore.” So then I went, and I rented a little room, and I went to Fodasyon [Fondasyon Limyè Lavi, an organization dedicated to ending restavec slavery in Haiti] and I was able to get a little loan, so I can do a little commerce. But it’s not really anything you would call money. It’s only a thousand gourdes [$25], and every fifteen days you have to pay back part of it. And so sometimes I would go and I would sell a few candles or some juice powder. And so whatever I would sell, I would buy some whatever it was… tomatoes or potatoes… and give to my children to eat. So there was a school close by, a rural school, that I was able to put my children into. But I wasn’t able to buy books, and every day they sent them back because I didn’t have any books. And so then in 2005, my second daughter was twelve years old. In 2005, when things got heated up politically, so that Aristide was going to be having a coup d’etat, she sent her daughter to a friend of hers in Village de Dieux. And while she was at this friend’s house in Village de Dieux, there were bandits that came in and raped her, and now she has a child at twelve years old. And now she’s taking care of a rape child, and I don’t have anything. I don’t have any commerce. I don’t have anything.And then now I’ve found an organization, it was like a delivery when I found them. And so sometimes when I’m not able to go to the meetings, they pool their money together, so I can give something so I can feed my children. So the two children that are in school can’t do their final exams, even though it’s not their national exams. I don’t have the money to pay for it.","Helia Lajeunesse is part of a women’s group, Limye Lavi, which works to end the institution of restavec in Haiti. Restavèk is a traditional system in which Haitian children from homes suffering economic and social difficulties are sent by parents to live with other families and work for them as domestic servants. There is a perception that the child will be enrolled in school by the host household and treated like one of the family, but often the reality is completely different. For many children, the day is filled with work. Lajeunesse’s own children were put into restavec fosterage when they were young, but with the help of Limye Lavi, her children are now free as well."
Henriette,2016 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Togo (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"I arrived in France when I was 14 from Togo, with a woman called Simone. My parents had entrusted me to this woman, who had promised them that I would come to France to work for her at her home, to help her and to have a better future and continue my studies. But that’s not what happened. After a couple of months, I realized that I would never go to school, that I wouldn’t have papers because I wasn’t declared. I ended up spending almost five years working in that house, eating the children’s leftovers, sleeping on the floor, denied the right to rest, to have time off, to get an education, to see a doctor, to leave her house. I had the right to go downstairs to pick up the children and do all the household work, that was all. Then I arrived at the home of another woman, Yasmina, who had paid Simone so that I would work for her. I got nothing, neither money nor training. I did everything she told me to at home. I was insulted, treated as though I was worthless. One day I tried to escape, but an uncle brought me back and told me that the woman had promised to get me papers, because she knew the right people.  After that, I took what came to me and I more or less gave up. I did everything she told me to, to the letter, like a robot. The years were passing and my strength and eyesight started to fail. I learned later at the hospital that I was anaemic and on the point of fainting, because I hadn’t been fed properly. That woman, Yasmina, told me that I wasn’t loved and that no one wanted me. She said she was the only one who was willing to look after me because she had a big heart. So I should be grateful to her and do everything she asked me to.  One day I spoke to the caretaker of the building, who told me, “You’re so young, why is it we only see you coming down to fetch the children and going back up again?” I couldn’t take anymore, I felt I had reached the end of my tether. I had to do something, or die, I’d either throw myself out of the window, or just wither away. The caretaker told me, “I can’t do anything for you, your story is incredible. No one will believe you. Go back to them and come and eat with me when she’s not there.” That’s what I did. That woman went and told the police what I had told her. One day, the police came to the door and I was able to get away from them. I was held on remand, then placed in a foster family.  That day I was taken to the Comité contre l’esclavage moderne (Committee against Modern Slavery). There were about 60 people there and they all had horrendous stories to tell. These young girls, they had been beaten and raped. They had undergone abortions in difficult conditions and had scars on their hands, because they’d been tied up in basements after having rebelled. Others had been burned on hotplates, for having disobeyed their employers. That day, I realized that I was not alone, and that I could not remain silent. When I left the meeting – it was a Sunday – I filed a complaint against those who had mistreated me, because they didn’t have the right to do that and because it had to stop. I received, and continue to receive, support from the Comité contre l’esclavage moderne. The police looked for Simone, who had brought me to France, but they couldn’t find her. I went back to see my parents and I realized that they, like me, had been duped twice. When they asked Simone where I was and what I was doing, she told them that I’d run away and that she didn’t know where I was. As for the second family, the woman and her husband were sentenced at first instance to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 euros. When I appeared before the district court, my case came up very quickly. I had the impression that I was a monster and that I was being accused of being unfair. But that didn’t scare me, because I was telling the truth, whereas they were unable to say what had happened or acknowledge how they had treated me. That’s what gave me strength. The roles were reversed. I told myself, “I’m speaking for myself. I’m speaking for all those young women, those who haven’t been heard, but who exist and who deserve respect and the right to live, no matter what their situation.","The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that there are approximately 129,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in France. Women and children from African nations being held in domestic servitude, like Henriette, often by relatives, is a recognised problem in France.Henriette, originally from Togo, became an enslaved domestic worker after her arrival in France at the age of 14. She was eventually helped by the Comité contre l’esclavage moderne (CCEM) (Committee against Modern Slavery), which works with victims of domestic slavery and forced labour in France. She was able to face some of her enslavers in court, and see their conviction. "
Holly (Narrative 2),2014 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Holly Smith, and I am a survivor of child sex trafficking within the United States. In 1992, at age 14, I was a shy, insecure, and angry teenager. I had just graduated eighth grade middle school, and I was afraid of starting high school. I was afraid of getting beat up, I was afraid of never being pretty or cool enough to get a boyfriend, and I was afraid of losing my friends. I was also very depressed and in need of real help and guidance. I grew up in rural South Jersey, and my friends and I often hung out at the local mall. It was at this mall that I met a man who picked me out of the crowd and asked for my phone number. I felt special that he picked me. And he told me that I was special when we talked on the phone. He said I was too mature for high school, that I was pretty enough to be a model. He said he could introduce me to famous bands and that I could become a songwriter. As a kid who grew up on MTV, this was my dream. After we talked on the phone for about two weeks, this man convinced me to run away from home with him. Within hours of running away, though, I was forced into prostitution on the streets and in the casino hotels and motels of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Thirty-six hours later, I was arrested by police and treated like a criminal. Without appropriate aftercare services, I struggled for many years to overcome my victimization. I struggled with depression, drug abuse, and domestic violence. As a young adult, I managed to put the past behind me, and I graduated college with a 3.6 GPA in Biology and a Minor in Writing. I had been working as a microbiology analyst for nearly ten years when I happened to watch a documentary on sex trafficking in India. It wasn’t until then that I realized that what had happened to me as a child happens to women and children across the globe. Today, I advocate against all forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) and all forms of human trafficking against any person. I recently wrote an academic book on child sex trafficking in the United States called Walking Prey (Palgrave Macmillan); and through my research, I discovered many inconsistencies in much of what I was seeing and hearing in the media. I believe the biggest lesson to learn from past Super Bowl preparations is the importance of credibility and longevity in prevention and aftercare efforts. In a blog post last week, Rachel Lloyd, Founder and CEO of Girls Educational & Mentoring Services (GEMS), explained that “shaky” and “overblown” statements and statistics can and has caused damage to the credibility of the anti-trafficking movement. “We want people to get engaged in this work and the movement for the long haul,” explained Lloyd. However, people are often “so put-off by the hyperbole” and sensationalized statistics that, soon after the sporting event has passed, they are left in a state of “disillusionment and cynicism” toward the movement. This kind of awareness and prevention is counteractive. Statistics and claims must be studied and verified; and prevention efforts cannot begin and end with sporting events. In January 1992, the year I was trafficked, the Washington Redskins and the Buffalo Bills competed at the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Had there been an anti-trafficking awareness campaign in Minneapolis, could the explosion of media attention reached me on the east coast? Could I have been warned? Maybe. I guess we’ll never know. But what I do know is this: there were significant awareness campaigns around the Super Bowl events in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Yet, after I had presented my story in 2013 to the very middle school from which I graduated in 1992, a girl raised her hand and asked me: “Why am I just now hearing about this?” I pose this question to the Committee: why had a 14-year-old girl in a group of at-risk youth never heard of child sex trafficking? It’s because our nationwide efforts on child sex trafficking prevention are misplaced and lacking. The Department of Education needs to create and include programs for the education and prevention of child exploitation. Such programs should address media literacy, healthy relationships, healthy role models, mental health awareness, coping skills, volunteer projects, education about social issues in the community and abroad (including human trafficking), and education about community resources. CSEC and sex trafficking of any person can happen at many types of sporting events, from “bike week” in Myrtle Beach, North Carolina to hunting season in South Dakota. However, there are many other risk factors in many communities in the United States that can raise the demand for commercial sex, thereby increasing the risk of CSEC and sex trafficking. These include but are not limited to: the presence of a commercial sex industry, legal or illegal; tourist and business attractions; proximity to military bases or other locations with transient populations of men; a high transit area; a subculture of homeless youth; a presence of gangs; and a proximity to national borders.Education and awareness campaigns about CSEC and sex trafficking of any person must be developed and maintained in all such communities in order to help prevent this type of exploitation. In addition, there must be outreach efforts to connect with potential victims and offer long-term aftercare services. Furthermore, programs must be created and maintained to address those factors that might predispose adults and children to being vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking. In my book, Walking Prey, I list many predisposing factors to keep in mind for prevention programs specific to CSEC, including school bullying and poverty. The same applies to other forms of child exploitation and human trafficking; awareness, prevention, and aftercare programs must address all risk factors and root issues. If we are to continue the campaign against sex trafficking at sporting events, then we must use the opportunity to bring to every city both accurate information and resources for long-term awareness, education, and aftercare. This is because, as Rachel Lloyd points out, “commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking will undoubtedly happen in the New York/New Jersey area during the first week of February [with Super Bowl XLVIII], and the second and third and fourth week of February and in March and April and every single day and every night throughout the year.” This applies to any community in the world that may be vulnerable to any form of exploitation. Thank you for providing me this opportunity to be here today.","Holly Austin Gibbs (formerly Smith) is a survivor of child sex trafficking and an advocate for survivors of all forms of human trafficking.

Iliona,2000 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Armenia (trafficked from),United Arab Emirates (slavery location),"My friend told me that we could earn money by doing trade in Dubai. I sold my house to get money for the trip and to buy some stuff from Dubai to sell in Armenia. I had done the same before, in Turkey. This time I was cheated. We traveled with my friend. Her friend from Dubai sent us an invitation. When we came to Dubai we were immediately taken to a hotel. Our friend who was married to a local Arab man told us that they had sent us the invitation not for shopping but for doing sex work. She also said that we had to serve as many men as they would propose and pay her a daily rate. I had been involved in sex work for many years; nevertheless I could not stand the pressure. They were forcing us to have sex with at least 40 men a day, sometimes even more. You had no right to reject the customer, even when he did not want to use condoms. Of course I understood that I was at risk to contract a disease, but I had no right to turn the client down. They were beating us awfully and we could not refuse a client even if we were feeling terribly sick. If someone spent more on food than we were supposed to (food is expensive in Dubai and in many cases we were hungry and thirsty), the Arab partner of our pimp would beat us with a belt. It was so painful. There were many cases when the clients were also violent. You were between two extremes: the violent client and the more violent pimp, who would terribly beat you or refuse to pay out if you disobeyed. The younger ones were crying all the time; they could not get used to all they were forced to do. They were like senseless objects after almost 24 hours of work. There are many Armenian women in Dubai, including my friends from Echmiadzin and Hrazdan. They are still coming. I am sorry for the young girls; they cannot stand this. They get sick quickly and are sent back home. It depends on the pimp, there are ones that never pay even one dollar to children, but I have heard of those also who gave $1000 when a child was returning home. As I did not have any documents and knew very well how corrupt the police was all over the world and their attitude to prostitutes, I did not even think of running away. I had no money, and was collecting the few dollars she gave to me to bring home for my son. He needs money to go to college. I want him to be an educated person and hold a high position in society. I got sick in Dubai and she had to send me back. Now I am here and do not even have a cent to buy bread. We live here from hand to mouth. I’ll try to get some money to do trade in Turkey.","Born in Armenia, Iliona was trafficked to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where an estimated 10,000 women from sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, Iraq, Iran, and Morocco are victims of sex trafficking. In addition, victims of child camel jockey trafficking still remain in the UAE: thousands of young boys have been trafficked from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Mauritania to work as camel jockeys, and though the UAE enacted a law banning the practice in July 2005, questions persist as to the effectiveness of the ban."
Ima (Narrative 2),2012 (Narrative date) ,Forced marriage Domestic slavery,Indonesia (slavery location) Indonesia (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,United States (slavery location),"My name is Ima Matul, and I’m originally from Indonesia. I’m a survivor of minor domestic servitude for three years. I was physically abused. I did not get paid, and I finally escaped with the help of the neighbors. I wrote a letter to the neighbors, and it took me awhile to give that letter. I don’t have the courage to do it, and I was so scared. I was what happens if my trafficker find out and all that, so it took me a long time. I finally have the courage to do it, and they helped me escape and took me to CAST. Since then CAST has been helping me with everything. They helped me with life to get my life back together and to get on my own feet and to be independent on my own. Learning about skills in life that I need. They send me to school to learn English, because I don’t speak much English when my trafficker brought me here. Anyway the reason I want to become an advocate, because number one I want to give back and because like all of you here are willing to help a survivor of trafficking. That’s why I want to give back, because all of you organizations like CAST and the other organizations, it’s helping the survivors. You don’t even know us, and you are willing to help us. Number two because I want to help the other survivor giving them hope, because when I was in that situation I don’t have hope. We don’t know anywhere. We came to this country. We know nothing about this country, so if I escape I don’t know where to go, if people are going to help me or not. I couldn’t believe that all of you are here to help us. I want to give them hope not to give up. There are people out there that care so much about the issue. One other thing is that survivors have very powerful voices, and we’re here not to tell our story, and it’s been since 2000 I believe that this legislation passed the law about human trafficking. I believe it’s enough to tell what happened to us, and we need to go beyond more than telling our story. We have a very powerful voice. Our story can impact other people, to legislators. For example, when we go to Sacramento for a bill that have to be passed some senator or legislator don’t want to support the law, because they don’t think it’s important. After they hear our story, we tell them that it’s very important to us to have this law passed. Then they change their mind. That is great. Also a survivor can give the courage to other survivors. For example, the Survivor Caucus at CAST, we have a shelter like once a month that we do at the end of the month to get together with the survivors and also the survivors that are in the recovery times. They’re still in the process of prosecuting the trafficker. One person told me it’s great to have a survivor who’s already independent to come to talk with others. We’re giving them courage to see us like oh wow. They were like me, and now that they have family they have a car. They know how to drive, and they have a fulltime job. It’s giving the courage to do. Not to give up, because some survivors after what happened to them, they decided to go home. They think they’re not worth it, but they’re wrong. The Survivor Caucus, in the beginning of 2011, we launch our first national network. We have our Facebook page, and it’s private. It’s for survivors only, and we meet once a month conference call. That was like this is a group of national network is very unique. It’s like from all types of survivors that comes together. It doesn’t matter the survivor of domestic servitude or sex trafficking. We all come together to talk about the issue, to work on something, to make the law better. Last year in September, we work on something we created for the first time that domestic survivor and U.S. citizen survivor come together. We wrote our first joint testimony to help pass the law. I’m not sure if it’s already passed, but you know we went to D.C. We attend the hearing, and we joined the testimony. It was the first time that foreign survivor was a U.S. Citizen survivor, because people think that some only concentrate on sex trafficking. They think that sex trafficking the story of more sad. What happens to them is worse but actually we’re all the save thing. Trafficking is trafficking. It doesn’t matter sex. It doesn’t matter domestic worker. We all suffer the same thing, so that’s why this national network is very good for us to get together not just think that sex trafficking is more important than domestic work. I think that’s all that I can share, and thank you very much. ","At age 16, Ima Matul was forced into an arranged marriage in Indonesia with a man 12 years her senior. After running away, was offered an opportunity to work in the United States as a nanny. But instead she was held in domestic forced labour for three years in Los Angeles.

Ima (Narrative 1),2009 (Narrative date) ,Forced marriage Domestic slavery,Indonesia (slavery location) Indonesia (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,United States (slavery location),"I was working for a family back home. They had a cousin in LA. She already had a nanny, but was expecting another baby, so she offered for me to come and work as a nanny. They said they had a friend who also needed work. So my cousin and I went. I flew to LAX. They took care of my passport and visa and I didn't have to pay anything. I was excited because before I was planning to go to Hong Kong to work as a housekeeper, but to go there I had to go through an agency and pay more money. But to the US it was very fast; I didn't have to wait. The family promised me $150 a month. This was a lot of money when you turned it into rupiahs. When I arrived in airport, the custom official took me to a room for an interview and asked to see my passport. They said I should keep it. After that, the other person who was going to be my employer picked me up. The employer told me to tell the customs agents that I was here to visit. The work wasn't that much because there was already a woman who came to clean. I just did the light cleaning and took care of their son. Three months later, the women who did the cleaning stopped coming. My boss asked, “Why do I need an extra worker?” From then on I did all the cleaning. When she picked me up, my boss said I could see my cousin sometimes, once a month to catch up, but this never happened. Once I wrote a letter to my cousin, but I didn't know the address. The letter came back. My boss asked if I wrote the letter. I said no. She saw the letter and started hitting me. She didn't trust me. She always hit me. If I did something, I did it wrong over and over. She took my salary away if I did something wrong…minus $5. One day she was so mad, she hit me on my right side. I was bleeding, and she didn't care. Her husband came home and put a bandage on it. He said it needed stitches. She took me to the hospital and told me not to say anything, to let her husband do all the talking. They said I fell. One time there was this bachan, a kind of rice frozen in a banana leaf. She hit me with it. It was like being hit by a rock. This is how the neighbor's worker noticed. In the afternoon she said hi. I didn't really talk to her because I didn't speak English. I told her I fell. She believed me because she always saw me washing windows. She ask again what happened, and later on I wrote her a letter and asked her to help me. I was scared. I gave her a letter on a Friday before she left for the weekend. I told her not to open it until she got home. She called her boss right away to check on me. They came, talked to my boss and her husband, and said they were planning to go on vacation. They were just pretending though; they wanted my boss to watch over their place. Then, their worker was back on Monday. I spoke with her. She asked if I wanted to leave. I said I was scared. What will happen if my boss finds out? She always threatened me. Will she whip me? I said this is why I'm scared to leave. The neighbor’s worker asked me again if I wanted to leave two to three weeks later. I decided I wanted to leave. Things were getting worse. Finally, I told her I'm ready to go. The day I left, I told her I’m scared. I'm not ready. My boss was home. Her son was napping. I didn't want to leave him. What if he wakes up and I'm not here? I went back and forth. I kept thinking, “I have to cook…” I said, “Let's wait until the husband comes home.” The worker told me that if I wanted to go, I’d have to go now. She waited for me two blocks away. I went inside and got my clothes. I had just one bag. I left the house and went to her car. I didn't know where I was and had no idea of the area. The worker drove me to the CAST office, but we got lost. But finally we arrived. Two other members of the Caucus were waiting for me. They were also Indonesian and were there to make me more comfortable. After coming to CAST I stayed at the Alexandria shelter for one day. Then I was at the Good Shepherd Center for three weeks. Then back at Alexandria House for fourteen months. I went to school and worked cleaning a house. I took care of a resident's baby. Finally, I was able to send some money to my family in Indonesia, after three years. That's why I had come to the US in the first place…to help them. I won't want to say it's impossible [to end slavery]; I believe anything is possible. We can't just change one person; everyone around the world must work to end slavery. We can't do it ourselves…. Other people need to know what slavery is. They need to learn and be educated about it. They need to tell other people about it. And if they see something they can tell somebody to report it.","At age 16, Ima Matul was forced into an arranged marriage in Indonesia with a man 12 years her senior.

Inez,2000 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Mexcio (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Before I came to the United States, I lived in a small town near Veracruz, Mexico. I helped support my family by working in the fields, harvesting lemons. Although I did not mind the work, I wished I could earn more money to help my family. Sometime in 1997, a woman named Maria Elena approached me and told me about opportunities for work in the United States. She told me she had worked there at a restaurant and had made good money. When I told my mother about the offer, she was skeptical. Since I was interested in helping my family out, I decided to learn more about this opportunity. Maria Elena set up a meeting with two men named Abel Cadena-Sosa and Patricio Sosa. At the meeting, the men confirmed that they had job openings for women like myself in American restaurants. They told me that they would take care of my immigration papers, and that I would be free to change jobs if I did not like working at the restaurants. I decided to accept the offer. In 1997, I was brought into the United States through Brownsville, Texas. Maria Elena traveled with me. We were both transported to Houston, Texas, where a man named Rogerio Cadena picked us up and took us to a trailer in Avon Park, Florida. In Avon Park, I met a girl named Sue who lived in the trailer. She asked me if I knew why I had come to Avon Park. I said I was going to work in a restaurant. She told me that I was actually going to be selling my body to men. I looked at Maria Elena in utter horror, but she did not appear surprised. Maria Elena admitted that she had already worked in trailer brothels in the past. She said it would not do anybody any good to complain. I was going to have to do the work anyway, since I had a smuggling debt to pay off. Maria Elena also warned me, “If you escape, Abel Cadena will go after your family because you owe him money.” Some of the other girls in the house also warned me that if I tried to escape, the men would find me and beat me up or abuse me. Rogerio Cadena said I had no place to run anyway, because my family was very far away and each trailer was located in a very isolated area. Rogerio then bought some tight clothes for me to wear when I worked and I was subsequently transported to a trailer in Ft. Pierce, Florida. A man named Jose Cuevas-Ataxca (known as “Lupito”) told me he was in charge of selling “tickets” to customers so they could go into the sitting room and pick a girl to have sexual relations with. I learned that the tickets were condoms. I was told that each customer would pay around $22, and that, in turn, each girl would be paid about $3 per customer. The rest of the money would go to pay our smuggling fee, our rent, and water. I also learned that every 15 days, I would be transported to a different trailer to keep working. I did not understand what happened to me. There was no way out. I began “working” in the trailers. The work was demeaning and frightening. I never had a moment’s rest. On the weekends, I would often have to see around 32 or 34 men, for $15 each. I would get myself drunk before the men arrived, so that I could stand the work. At the end of the shift, I would fill a bathtub with hot water and lay in it, drinking and crying. I would smoke one cigarette after another, and then go to bed drunk because it was the only way I could fall asleep. The bosses had no mercy. I felt terrible pain in my vagina and I asked repeatedly to be taken to the doctor. No one ever took me. But they did take the girls who became pregnant to a doctor where they performed forced abortions. Several of the young women and girls in the brothel had had these abortions. Many of the men were violent. I will never forget a night in Avon Park. Rogerio Cadena had thrown a party in the trailer. I went outside for air. He thought I was trying to escape and he ran out after me and told me, “You don’t know what I’m capable of.” He hit me on the mouth, broke my lip, and began to beat me on the chest. I stumbled back to the trailer. I knew I could not take this anymore. I went to my room, put some clothes in a bag, and jumped out of the window. One of the other girls came with me and we ran to a house nearby where she said she knew someone. We spent the night there. The next morning, the bosses arrived at the house. Somehow, they knew we were there. They took us back to the trailer, and we began another day of work. Although it has been more than a year since all of this occurred, I cannot seem to get past the ordeal. I am dating a young man now, and I try to act like a normal girl, but it is not always easy. I also have a steady job and will soon be promoted, but I lack confidence and never feel secure. Once in awhile, I still have anxiety attacks. I still remember the horrible beatings, the constant threats, and the drunk and pushy customers. I am trying hard to be the person I was before I came to the United States.","The US Department of Justice estimates that of the 14,500 and 17,500 foreign-born individuals trafficked into the US annually, some 80 percent are female, and 70 percent of these women end up as sex slaves. Feeder countries include Albania, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico (many from the central region of Tlaxcala, a haven for modern-day slave traders), Nigeria, and Ukraine. Often the women are forced to work to pay off the debts imposed by their smugglers—debts ranging from $40,000 to $60,000 per person. They might perform 4000 acts of sexual intercourse each year to meet their quota, at $10 to $25 per act. In 1997, at the age of 18, Inez was trafficked from Mexico into sex slavery in the US. She was transported into Texas, then to a trailer in Florida. Up to four young women worked in the same trailer, each of them having sex with up to 35 men a day, for 12 hours a day. They were constantly guarded, and beaten and raped by their bosses. After she had been enslaved for several months, FBI agents, along with agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and local law offices, raided the brothel. Some of her captors were tried, others escaped and returned to Mexico. Inez now observes that she cannot “seem to get past the ordeal” of slavery. The turning-point from slavery to freedom has not occurred: Inez’s narrative is filled with phrases like “I will never forget,” “I try to act like a normal girl, but it is not always easy,” “I lack confidence and never feel secure.”"
Intan,2005 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,Indonesia (trafficked from),Malaysia (slavery location),"The arrangement was that I would be a domestic worker but I spent my days cleaning ditches using Clorox, a whitening substance. My feet were ruined because they did not provide me with shoes. We were only given brushes, but we did not get shoes. My feet hurt. I was there for eight months when I got word from my family that my child need to undergo surgery. I asked for my salary, so that I can send some money, but my employer didn’t give it to me. Two months later my child was discharged from the hospital, but two months afterwards he got infected and was readmitted to the hospital. Again I asked but he never gave me that money. Not ever. I worked for that employer for one and a half years. During the second month of 2006 my employer called my recruiting agent. My employer said that he will be going on a trip for one month to India. He talked with the agent in Tamil, my employer was an Indian and so was my agent. They conversed using Tamil. After they finished talking I was told to gather my clothes. I asked where I was going because I was still working, my work hours was not yet up. “Just come with me,” he said. I asked how will I return? How about my money? He told me just to go along. Because they were talking to each other in Tamil, I assumed that my money was already handed over to the agent.","Intan is an Indonesian woman who was enslaved in Malaysia doing work that was hazardous to her health. Foreign workers constitute more than 20 percent of the Malaysian workforce and typically migrate voluntarily—often illegally—to Malaysia from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries, often in pursuit of better economic opportunities. However, workers can find themselves imprisoned, exploited, and in debt bondage. The law allows many of the fees of migration, which are first paid by employers, to be deducted from workers’ wages, incentivizing employers to prevent workers from ending their employment before fees are recovered."
Irene,2005 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Forced labour,Indonesia (trafficked from) Forced labour,Malaysia (slavery location),"I worked in Selangor. I start work at six in the morning, and I finish work at four the next morning. I was only given this rice and salt to eat without any meat. I was given a meal only once a day, at half past one in the afternoon. I was given a break for only 15 minutes, no more. We had to produce 70 barrels of tofu every day. I prepared the ingredients. I suffered burns to my skin due to contact with the chemicals contained in the tofu. There were five kinds of chemicals, labeled in Chinese letters. When I came into contact with these chemicals, my hands would swell and also my feet. It was mixed with the filtered eggs. We wore rubber gloves, but the water and chemicals seeped through. I worked at the factory for two months. During the two months there were many harassments, because there were ten male workers from Myanmar, and I was the only female Indonesian workers. After work I was usually afraid, afraid that I would be raped. Once I tried to kill myself, by drinking poison, because I can’t stand the work. I was not only making tofu, but after work I also had to clean the floors which would use up about five barrels of water. And then I would have to wash the equipments that are used to produce the tofu. To wash three pieces of equipment takes around eight hours. I asked my employer to have one of the Myanmarese workers help me wash the equipments, but she answered “I purchased you from your agent for 7,000 [ringgits], so you can’t have any help,” and then she slapped me two times. Looking at me, the Myanmarese workers mocked me. If I had known their language I would have retaliated. Everyday they made fun of me, insult me. I was once even locked in the toilet for two days by the Myanmarese workers. I was scared, there were ten of them and I was alone. Luckily there was a chair in the toilet, and I used it to jump out of the room and was able to return to the factory floor. There were no daily supervision by my employer. The work was completely entrusted to me and the Myanmarese workers. Finally, after my body hurt all over, and I couldn’t stand it any longer, there was one of the Myanmareses, Machi, who took pity and he told me to run, let myself be caught by the police, rather than work like this. He said your work should be done by six persons, but you are working alone. He told me to escape and that he will wait for me. He gave directions. He told me to run straight, and at the fork of the road I must not choose the left fork, because I would be chased by black Indians, killed, have my heart and kidneys removed and sold to the hospital. He told me to take the road to the right, and I will arrive at the main street. I walked for four hours, from two o’clock in the morning. Machi told me not to go before or after two o’clock for my own safety. If you find a policeman or someone willing to help, just trust that person. But I prayed that I would not be caught by the police, because I would certainly be arrested and jailed, after being hit with a rattan cane. Thank God I did not meet any policeman nor anybody on the street. I walked for four hours. I was chased by forest wild dogs because the factory was located in the middle of a forest in the suburbs. I was chased by eight dogs, but I held on to my Al Quran and read out the istighfar and the prophet’s prayers, and thank god the dogs only ran behind me, beside me, and in front of me, but they did not bite. But my clothes were wet, I peed in my pants because I was scared that I was going to die. But fortunately after four hours I arrived at a house of a Malay. Upon arriving there I was only able to say three words, please help me, and then I passed out. After that, maybe I was taken inside by the owner of the house and taken care of for three days and three nights. The Malay was a bit confused and scared because I didn’t have a passport nor a work permit. Then he told me it would be better if we go to the embassy. My body hurt so much. At the embassy I was bedridden for a week and was tended by a physician, because my hands were in such a hideous state, their skin peeling off. I still have deep scars, and my leg has not healed because the ointment is used up.","Irene is an Indonesian woman who was enslaved in Malaysia doing factory work that was hazardous to her health.

Irina V.,2006 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Russia (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Germany (slavery location),"My name is Irina Veselykh. In 1983, I graduated from the construction college in Amur and from 1984 until 1991 I worked as an engineer in the department of production at a construction company. I was married in 1996 and I have two daughters. During perestroika (1992-1997), I re-qualified to be an accountant and later worked as a senior accountant at a hospital. Afterwards, I divorced my alcoholic husband, took a one-year course in massage and cosmetology, and moved to Volgodonsk where I worked in a clinic as a physiotherapist. I was only making $100/month and supporting two children on my own. Because I needed more income and was in debt, I began looking for advertisements for short-term work abroad. I had hoped to work for a maximum of six months to one year and send the money home to my children. I came across an advertisement offering work abroad in the newspaper Chance. The company that I turned to for help finding work appeared to be entirely legitimate and I didn’t feel any apprehension. The Agency for Employment Abroad offered me work as a waitress. I was given 500 euros [$650] for a visa, tickets, and travel with the understanding that I would return 1000 euros [$1300] when I was working. I was to earn 800-900 euros [$1000-1150] a month. Everything was arranged from the company’s offices in Volgograd and Moscow. I was told that I would have a six month contract once I arrived in Germany. I signed their contract since everything seemed trustworthy and they assured me that the work in Germany was legal. I traveled by bus through Poland without any money for food. When I arrived in Germany in the city of Bremen, I was met by two extremely rude young Russians named Evgeny and Tatiana. They took my passport and informed me that there was no waitress job and that I was expected to work as a prostitute. When I objected, they told me that if I wanted to go home I had to pay back the 1000 euros. I tried to refuse and they beat me. When I threatened to go to the police, I was warned that the police had been bought off and that without my documents I would be considered the criminal. They said that all the pimps are working under the protection of the police. They control girls with the help of the police. They showed me photographs of dead girls who had tried to go to the police. I was terribly shocked and afraid. I decided that the only way to survive was to cooperate. Almost immediately, Tatiana and Evgeny left for a vacation in the Canary Islands and I was sold to another man, Viktor, who was running a business in Bremen selling young Russian girls to Belgian pimps for $15,000 a piece. I started working in a brothel managed by a German woman named Tony. This was a kind of point of dispensation—some women were sold to Belgium, some to the Netherlands and other places. I was popular with German and Dutch men so they kept me there. The majority of men were Germans. Tony’s place was a legal brothel but she knew that most of the women there were illegal and had no documents because all of their documents had been taken by the pimps. Viktor and a Lithuanian woman named Monika gave me a fake Lithuanian passport. All the new Russian girls who came were forced to buy the fake Lithuanian passports for 2000 euroes [$2600]. However, Viktor kept the actual passports and the false ones. In addition, Viktor and the other pimps reminded all of us constantly that they knew where our families were and they would kill our children if we tried to escape. I complained that I could not pay my debts, so they sent me to a different club where I could service more clients and pay lower rent. I was then taken to a club called “Diplomat,” which is in the Netherlands on the border with Germany. But I saw right away that no matter how many men there were, I could never repay the debts. I immediately made the decision to run away. There were three other women, also terrified, who had already been living there for a few months (also on false documents). A beautiful Russian girl by the name of Tatiana helped me try to run away by stealing my fake passport and all of my real documents from the pimps. She said she could not go with me because the pimps had threatened to kill her two-year-old son back in Russia. She wanted me to get away and get help for her and her family. But I later learned from Russian men who were trying to help me that she was killed for helping me. Other girls in the club helped me escape and I took a taxi to the town of Van Shoten, looking for a man named Ben who owned a nightclub called “Antenna” and was known to help girls escape from trafficking and the Russian mafia. He helped hide me but the Russian mafia found me working as a hostess and told me that I was going to be killed. That night Ben took me by car to his Dutch friends, who hid me for two weeks in their garage and brought me food while I was being hunted. I was moved from one place to another, working in nightclubs as a waitress but not as a prostitute. Many good Dutch people tried to help me, but I was always followed by the Russian gangsters. I needed to get to the police but it was dangerous. The Dutch people I was staying with brought my 21-year-old daughter to the Netherlands to help me. With my daughter, who speaks English, I went directly to the police. But at the police station, I was immediately separated from my daughter and detained for five days by the Dutch National Police. So began a long, terrible process of multiple questionings and misunderstandings by the authorities. The authorities wanted to charge me for using the false passport that I was provided by the criminals. I gave the Dutch police all of the information about what had happened including information about the traffickers, the Russian mafia. I told them everything I knew and I thought they would help me. I was not provided with a lawyer and I was suddenly told that I had to work out the fine levied by the judicial system of the Netherlands for the use of a false passport. I hadn’t even used that passport and did not agree with the decision of the court. But who listened to me? After all the assistance that I provided the investigators, I was placed in humiliating conditions and remained in serious danger without protection from the Russian gangsters. After determining that the crime had taken place in Germany, the Dutch National Police turned me over to the Migration Police and they placed me in a shelter. I provided the authorities with all of the information again while the police investigated and verified every part of my story. After two weeks, I was released from the shelter and I returned to my daughter. But eventually, my daughter had to go home to work. I stayed in the Netherlands for two years, living only on the small benefits I received with the help of kind Dutch people. Finally, I grew tired of this situation. I could not wait any longer for my appointment in court living in such circumstances. I told the Dutch authorities that I wanted to go home. I said that I would return if they needed me to testify, but I was very, very tired. My health was poor. I missed my daughters. I was constantly depressed and often thinking about suicide. But instead of helping me go home, the Dutch government decided I had not suffered enough and placed me in prison for three months because I didn’t pay the fine for using a false passport—a fine that I didn’t know about. There was a contradiction between the Dutch National Police who wanted the fine paid and the Immigration Police who acknowledged that I was a victim of trafficking. For one month, I was not allowed to get in contact with lawyers or with my relatives. I started a hunger strike to defend my innocence, but as a result I was put into solitary confinement with only a mattress on the floor. I was only able to get help when my daughter contacted the Russian consul in the Netherlands with the help of the Angel Coalition in Moscow. My daughter had called the Angel Coalition Trafficking Victim Assistance Center on their toll-free helpline and the Angel Coalition contacted the Dutch law enforcement liaison officer at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow. He began investigating with the Dutch police while the Angel Coalition worked with my family. I was released on the street with 30 euros [$40]. The police were supposed to take me to the consulate but they gave me no help. Local people helped me get to the consulate. From there I was sent for a short time to a shelter and then returned home to Russia. The Angel Coalition met me at the airport, gave me a ticket home, and provided me with medicine. This is the only human assistance that I received during the entire time that I was in this terrible situation. The Angel Coalition is still helping me cope with all the terrible things I went through in Germany and the Netherlands. I did not commit any crime in those countries and I was put in prison for absolutely nothing. The people who involved me in that situation are still free and continue to traffic women under government cover. My rights were violated—who will pay me back for all of my suffering? In those countries, the rights of immigrants in difficult situations are violated and their governments do not want to take responsibility for what is happening on their territory.  ","Irina V. was trafficked into Germany from Russia, where traffickers abduct an estimated 55,000 women each year. She was taken along the so-called “Eastern Route” through Poland. This is a key overland corridor for trafficking women into the EU from Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and the Baltics. Her narrative grapples with the fact that her enslavers “continue to traffic women” and also outlines a more practical problem. Upon her escape, she “began a long, terrible process of multiple questionings and misunderstandings,” was placed in prison for three months, and only received assistance from an NGO."
Jaroslava,2014 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Slovakia (trafficked from),United Kingdom (slavery location),"My name is Jaroslava. I come from Slovakia, a rural area called Bohemia. I lived with my family and I am Roma. Our life there was very hard and it was difficult for me to find work to support my family. One day a very good friend told me that he could get me work in the UK. He told me that I would be able to earn enough money to send some home to my family. I thought that I would be working in a sandwich factory and that they would provide me with somewhere to stay. My friend told me that this would cost a small amount of money to arrange but that I could pay him back a little each month from my wages. I knew that the work would be hard but I was excited that I was going to live in London and be able to send money home to support my family. I hoped that I would learn English and be able to get a better job as a waitress or working in a bar. My friend bought me a ticket for the bus, gave me some money to buy food on the journey and told me that his friend Arnost would meet me at the station in London. Everyone on the bus was going to look for a better life in the UK or were going to visit relatives who were here. I had some cousins in Glasgow and was hoping to visit them when I could get time off even though I hadn’t seen them since I was a little girl. It was dark when we got to London and I was very tired but Arnost was there to meet me and was very kind. We took a black London taxi to his flat where he told me to rest and that in the morning he would take me to the sandwich factory to start work. I was a bit worried about being alone in a flat with a strange man but as Arnost had been good I told myself I was being silly. The next morning after breakfast Arnost’s friend came to collect us and drive us to the factory. We drove for a little while and stopped at a house. Arnost said he had to talk to someone but that I should come in too and have a coffee. When we got into the house Arnost suddenly changed. He started to shout at me and said that I owed him money which he needed now. I explained that I didn’t have it and he told me I would have to become a prostitute to pay him back. I was shocked and confused. I told him that I wouldn’t do that, that I would cook and clean for him and pay him back as soon as I got my first wages from the factory but he laughed and called me stupid. He told me I was naive to think that I could get a job in the UK and surely I must have known that I was going to work in a brothel. I started to cry and became very scared. I was still saying that I wouldn’t do it when Arnost slapped me and raped me saying that this was what I deserved, that I’d better get used to it and that this is what he would do if I ever disobeyed him again. When it was over Arnost left the house and a woman appeared and helped me. The other woman tried to comfort me and told me it would be ok, that it wasn’t so bad. I was too scared to say anything. I was taken upstairs to a bedroom where I was told I would sleep. I heard them lock the door and then I slept. I woke up and was told that a man had paid to have sex with me and that I‘d better behave myself or Arnost would kill me. A young man came into the room. Although he saw my black eye and the bruises and although I cried he still had sex with me. After that I learned to take myself away in my head, I learnt to smile at the men and to pretend that it was all ok – life was easier and less painful that way. Arnost would come to see me everyday and take the money that the men had paid – I never saw any. One day I made a mistake and asked Arnost if I had paid back the money I owed him. He hit me hard, laughed and walked out of the room. I used to have to see 5/6 men for sex everyday. Two months after I arrived in London an old Slovak man had sex with me. He was as old as my grandfather and that made me cry. I told him what had happened but he said that it was none of his business. He must have felt guilty though because after he finished he gave me 30 pounds. It was the first money I had since arriving in London. Early the next morning when everyone was sleeping I left the house. Somehow I got to the bus station and got a bus to Glasgow. I called my cousins when I arrived and they told me what bus to get to their house. I didn’t tell them what had happened to me in London as I was too ashamed. They had very little money and told me that they couldn’t afford to keep me that I would have to find some work. My Aunt took me to one side and said that if I was really desperate she knew some people who would pay me money for sex. I felt sick. I ran out of the house and into a busy street I got on the first bus I could see and ended up in the city centre. Someone told me that the local government could help me and took me to the Hamish Allen Centre. They gave me a place to stay for the night and the next morning I met a kind woman who I told a little of my story. She was obviously very worried about me and asked if I would like to meet a worker from a woman’s project who could help. The TARA Service came out that afternoon to see me and when they explained who they were I started to cry. I told them about what had happened and they agreed to try to help me. They found me somewhere safe to stay and I had someone visit me everyday. At weekends one of the workers would come out to see me, sometimes she would take me out other times we would go to the supermarket or go for a drive. They gave me money to buy food and a mobile telephone.  They helped me see a doctor and when I found out I had hepatitis helped me understand what that meant. I wanted to stay in Scotland and work and they helped me find some work experience and I attended an ESOL class to learn English as a second language.   As I got to know the staff better I told them more about what had happened to me. They arranged for me to meet with the police in Glasgow so I could tell them what had happened. As I was very scared my TARA worker came with me and sat beside me when I told everything. They arranged for my statement to be shared with their colleagues in London where I was raped and exploited. Eventually I just wanted to go home. I wanted to see my family. I was very scared and didn’t want my family to know that I’d been raped and forced to be a prostitute. The TARA arranged for me to go back to Slovakia and meet with an anti-trafficking organisation there. I now have a job working in a children’s hospital and am continuing to learn English. I’m taking driving lessons too! Although it is still very hard when I remember or dream about what happened in London I feel hopeful for my future.","Jaroslava is a Slovakian woman who travelled to the UK on the false promise of a job in a sandwich factory but instead enslaved in prostitution in London. She managed to escape to Glasgow and was put in touch with the Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), which has provided support to allow Jaroslava to establish a job and aspirations for the future. The majority of those trafficked to the UK have been identified victims of sexual exploitation, followed by adults exploited in the domestic service sector and other types of labour exploitation."
Isra,1999 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Thailand (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Canada (slavery location),"When I first arrived, I worked and stayed at a place on Kennedy Road. I stayed with the owner who had bought me. Later on, there were quite a number of women who worked there—about four other girls. I used to serve four to five customers per day. Some days, I had 11 customers. I wanted to finish my contract quickly. Once there were more girls, I did not have to work as much and the owner decided to move me to another place, which was where I was arrested. At this place, I had to put up with all kinds of customers. They were all drunk and stupid. I had to do everything they wanted. At first, I could not stand it. I went back to the first place because one of the girls who had come here a month before me had finished her contract. At the time, the owner of the parlor was going to the US. At first she told me that she would take me back to the second place to work and I just had to let her do that. She let me go back, however, when one of my regular customers was going to spend the night. When I came back the next day, she told me that she would like me to finish my contract fast and she would take me to her friend’s parlor in the Sheppard area. I had no objection. She could do anything to me because I wanted to finish the contract as soon as possible. However, instead of taking me to her friend’s, she sold me to a Thai girl who had a Vietnamese boyfriend, in Mississauga. I could not stand staying there because I did not have enough customers. After two or three days, I could not stand it anymore. At the time I owed $12,000 more. It took seven or eight days before my former boss bought me back. The boss bought me for $10,000 and wanted $2000 from me. Every day, I had to work. I had no time to rest even when I had my period. Sometimes when I got really tired, she asked her boyfriend to take me to her place for some sleep. I could not sleep at the massage parlor because the owner had fights with her boyfriend. I had to put up with my circumstances because I owed them money. If I finished paying her back I could leave. I had to work every day because they forced me to. I had to have my period in one day; I had to take three or four birth control pills per day. Actually, I did not want to work at all. When I told her that I hurt, and where, she still made me work without stopping. I had to be patient and I never had a fight with her. The owner was a workaholic. If we did not have enough customers on any day, she would start to complain and use abusive language saying that I did not do a good job. I just had to be patient and listen to her. When we had lots of customers, she was happy and went out with her boyfriend, but when they came back, they started fighting again. One day I woke up early in the morning to launder my clothes at a place near my work. On that day, the owner of my massage parlor went out to advertise our phone number—that hadn’t been done for one to two months. At that house, one of my friends was making a dish called “Kanom Jeen Man Nguew.” That day the house was strangely quiet. I felt like going out; I did not want to stay at in this parlor. One of the reasons was that all day we had had only two customers. I worked for one and my friend worked for the other. The owner of the parlor, my friend and I played a card game. We finished the game. I was lying down on the sofa. There was a Vietnamese man who came to see the owner. This person was looking for a girl to work at his place. After the conversation was over with the owner, the Vietnamese man walked out the door. After about five minutes, there was somebody knocking on the door. The owner of the parlor opened the door and thought that it was a customer. She did not look through the cat door. That was the moment we were about to be arrested. It was about eight or nine at night. There was a middle aged Vietnamese-Chinese man who knocked on the door. She opened the door. As soon as she opened the door, the police, about ten of them, raided the place. They ordered us to be still and not move. The owner of the place turned very pale, like a boiled egg. Some of the policemen searched for evidence. They broke the glass windows in two rooms—the workroom and the room that the owner and I stayed in. The officers who restrained us shouted very loud saying that we should not do anything. My friend and I and the owner of the place sat on the sofa with our hearts sunk and lost. I told myself that I was arrested, and would accept the situation later on. The owner of the place could not control herself and cried. ","Isra, a Thai national, was a sex slave in Canada. She is one of around 600-800 trafficked people who arrive in Canada each year. A further 1500-2200 people are trafficked through Canada into the US. Canadian officials note that both these estimates are conservative, for very few victims of trafficking report the crime. Most trafficking victims who arrive in Canada come from South Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and most are women trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In the global market for people, the vulnerable are trafficked from poorer countries to richer countries, and many thousands of these trafficked women arrive in Western Europe, the UK, Canada, and the US. Between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders each year, according to the US State Department. Some NGOs claim the figure is four million, and the UN puts the average estimate of international organizations at two million. Perhaps the most well-publicized form of this international trafficking is sex trafficking. By some estimates, as many as two million women worldwide are currently trapped in forced prostitution. And for those who are trafficked across international borders (many of them from Eastern Europe, South Asia, and South America), there is a double bind: not only of the brothel owner’s restrictions, but the restrictions of a foreign country where they cannot speak the language, have no knowledge of their legal rights, and often fear the police. In 1996, Canadian law enforcement officials learned that a Toronto-based sex trade ring was procuring young women from Thailand and Malaysia aged 16 to 30. Agents sold the women’s services to brothel owners for $16,000 to $25,000 each. Then, before they could keep a percentage of their earnings, the women had to work off the cost of their transportation and a “debt bond” that ranged from $30,000 to $40,000—which meant servicing 500 customers. Their travel documents were confiscated and their movements were restricted. On December 2, 1998, police officers arrested 68 people at ten brothels in Toronto, including Isra. One of the charges laid against the brothel owners was forcible confinement."
Jiang,1999 (Narrative date) ,Prison labour,China (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"I had lived for 30 years in mainland China. For 23 of those 30 years I was persecuted by the Chinese communist authorities, and 20 years were spent in slave labor in the prison system. My parents and their six children were born in Indonesia. I was born in 1928 in Medan City, Sumatra. While at a Chinese-language school, influenced by a leftist-inclined teacher, I started reading Mao Zedong's books. While in Singapore, I joined the New Democratic Youth League, a youth organization of the Malayan Communist Party. As head of leftist students, I was dubbed as the “Mao Zedong of Medan.” In early 1949, aged 21, I went to Hong Kong. In May of that year, recommended by the Chinese communist authorities, together with a group of South-East Asia leftist Chinese students, I arrived in Peking (Beijing since mid-1960s), where the department of united front, Chinese communist party's central committee, established a special “Overseas Chinese Youths Training Course,” its purpose being to train us into cadres responsible for exporting revolution in the future. In 1952, shortly before I graduated from high school, I was admitted by the department of architecture, Tsinhua University. During the “movement to wipe out counterrevolutionaries” of 1955-56, I became a target. Twice, I was denounced and struggled against in my class and in the department. I was accused of “listening in to an enemy broadcasting station, the Voice of America,” of “blemishes in my past,” and so on, and so on. In 1957, another political movement started, it was the “rectification movement.” We were encouraged to “voice our opinions to the Party.” Many times, at the “Free Tribune,” I condemned the communist party's despotic rule. For that I was labelled as a “rightist student.” In midnight, March 14, 1959, the communist party escorted me to reeducation through labor. Since then, for 20 long years, I was tormented in the mincing machine of the communist dictatorship. The very first day I was escorted by policemen to Peking reeducation-through-labor detention facility, I started laboring—combing hemp, making cotton shoe soles. Comparatively, that was light labor. But the regimen was tight. We had to labor non-stop. Talking was prohibited. Those who violated the discipline were criticized and struggled against in the evenings. What we ate was cattle fodder. We slept like cram-packed sardines. It was the first time that I experienced communistic slavery. Later, I was escorted to Qinghe Farm in Hebei Province. When we exited the train at Chadian Railroad Station, the farm's political commissar gave us an admonitory speech. He said that we were welcome to labor and to reform our thought. Actually, what was welcoming us were squad automatic weapons mounted on top of the station, their muzzles aimed at us. Earthwork and diversion canal construction were the heaviest labor on the farm. One of the guys fell sick. I saw he was at his last gasp, but the commander said he was pretending to be sick and ordered two fellow inmates to prop him up, forcing him to go on with earthwork. The second day that guy never woke up. We labored from the moment the moon went down to the moment the moon came up. During the “three years of natural disasters” we were only fed cakes and porridge cooked from barnyard millet. The amount was pitiable. Many inmates simply died one after another—from hunger and exhaustion. There was no time limit to reeducation through labor, which meant it was tantamount to a life sentence. On July 6, 1960, at midnight, risking my life, I successfully made my way through an electrified wire netting. I thought I had made a successful escape from hell. I decided to flee to Burma. I slept more than 20 days in the wildness. But, I was apprehended by the police and thrown into Peking's Caoluanzi detention facility, which doubled as prison. I was totally cut off from the outside world. They starved me, trying to extort confession from me. I and other inmates had to sit motionless in the same position, had to study prison regulations and discipline night and day. I was found to be one who did not confess crimes and did not plead guilty. I was handcuffed at the back and leg ironed, was denounced and struggled against, was incarcerated in solitary confinement. I was handed a copy of my verdict: life imprisonment as a counterrevolutionary. When No. 1 Detention Facility was fully packed, in a ward about 15 sq. m., 42 inmates were incarcerated. The inmates had to sleep on their side, every one's nose was pressed between two fellow inmates' stinking feet. In spite of heavy labor in daytime, we were fed only corn buns and vegetable soup (you had to find traces of edible oil under a microscope!). When the situation was worst, instead of corn buns, we were given only two brim-full bowls of steamed sweet potato. One guy couldn't bear it and tried to kill himself through hunger strike. A few days later the commander ordered other inmates to tube down rice soup through his nostrils. As a matter of fact inmates had to control each other, and it was virtually impossible to kill yourself in a ward. One year later I appealed to the supreme court, and my appeal was turned down. The nature of my “crime” remained counterrevolutionary, but my term was commuted to five years. From No. 1 Detention Facility I was sent to Liangxiang Machinery Factory and Yanqing Brickyard. Both were labor-reform units under the public security bureau. About 300 male and female mentally-disabled inmates were incarcerated in Yanqing Prison, alias Yanqing Brickyard. While at Yanqing Prison, my term expired. I was forced to take a job within the same prison. Thus, my second term of labor reform began, and I became a forced-job-placement employee. In 1966 I escaped to Dandong, successfully crossed the Yalu River, entered North Korea. I had planned to go to the free world via North Korea. But, the North Korean government expatriated me to China. In Liangxiang, in a solitary confinement cell, I was incarcerated four months, given only a 6.6 oz corn bun and a small piece of pickle, which was standard solitary confinement ration, enough only for the inmates to keep breathing. I was so hungry that I had to lie down all the time, although I could not fall asleep. So, I was tormented both physically and mentally. Then, I was “formally arrested,” escorted to No. 1 Detention Facility, where I was handcuffed at the back as a form of punishment. Later on, I was escorted to No. 1 Prison, which was only one wall apart. Attached to the prison was a factory for making nylon socks—Gold Horse brand for exportation, Twin Deer and Twin Ram brands for domestic consumption. Only many years later when I reached Hong Kong did I know that the Chinese communist authorities consistently denied exportation of labor-reform products. At No. 1 Prison, I was I was handcuffed at the back, even hung up, only because I asked a fellow prisoner what certain words were in Japanese, and wrote those words down on a piece of toilet paper in order to memorize them. The handcuffs' teeth bit into my wrists, and the pain was excruciating. During the Cultural Revolution, only Mao Zedong's works could be read. It was forbidden even to use a dictionary. In March 1969, when China and the Soviet Union were at war in the Zhengbao Island, the authorities secretly transferred all prisoners from Beijing to detention facilities in Hebei Province's counties and cities. The detention facilities doubled as prisons. I was transferred to Raoyang County, where food was worst. Only once a year, during the Spring Festival, could we prisoners eat half a bowl of pork. Because of serious lack of protein, all inmates suffered from edema. In fall, when it turned chilly, insects crept into wards. Some inmates caught and ate them. A student by the name of Zou ate poisonous insects and died. A local old peasant was sentenced to five-year imprisonment only because he wrote five words with a tree branch on the ground. Asked which words he wrote, he dared not say, for fear he might commit a fresh crime and his sentence could thus be aggravated. Actually, everybody knew what the five words were: Down With The Communist Party. It was then the period of “dealing blows at counterrevolutionary activities and struggling against three evils. The authorities needed to execute a group of prisoners. I, Zhang Lang-Lang and Zhou Qi-Yue were on the list to be executed. Asked whether I was “overseas Chinese,” I said yes. And Zhang and Zhou were sons of high-ranking officials. Only thus did the three of us escape being executed. But others, like Song Hui-Min, So Jia-Lin, Wang Tao, as well as others I did not know by names—they were all executed. Why then, did the communist authorities want to execute me in spite of the fact that I dared not cross the Amur River, knowing it was extremely dangerous to cross over to the Soviet Union? Very simple: they regarded me as “an unrepentant counterrevolutionary with unchanging granite brains,” because I never pleaded guilty, and they failed to find the words “I plead guilty” in my files. The authorities hate those prisoners who do not plead guilty, because that means the authorities wrongly convict good people. How can the great, glorious and correct communist party wrongly convict people?! Ten years after my term expired, I was still not allowed to return to normal life. I was escorted to Hulu County Cement Plant (also a labor-reform facility), and finally to Tangjiazhuang Labor-Reform Farm for a “second term of labor reform.” Many prisoners who could endure all kinds of hardships during their terms, putting their hopes on a normal, post-labor-reform life, finally killed themselves in their “second terms,” being utterly despaired. From March 14, 1959, when I was escorted from Tsinhua University to #583 Reeducation-Through-Labor Farm, to March 13, 1979, when I arrived in Hong Kong, I suffered 20 long years (15 years as a convicted labor-reform prisoner) in 17 different detention facilities, prisons and labor-reform detachments—the mincing machine of the dictatorship of the proletariat (rather: the communist party). The 20 years of my youth were squandered in forced labor, in creating wealth for the Chinese communist party, or, in their words, in “transforming the Great Northern Wilderness into a bread basket.” Before I left the mainland, Beijing's Qinghua University rehabilitated me as a “rightist element,” gave me 1,000 RMB in the form of living subsidies. The court issued me a copy of “retrial sentence,” declaring me innocent. All this was supposed to be “the party's loving care for me.” And really, some of my friends did ask me to express my gratitude to the communist party. But, I could only express my gratitude to certain individuals. This has nothing to do with individual. Involved here is the evil communist totalitarian regime. Without exterminating this system thousands upon thousands of new wrong cases will be created.","Guo Jiang spent 20 years in slave labor within the Chinese prison system. Officially abolished on 28th December 2013, Reeducation Through Labour Camps subjected dissidents to forced labour, torture and terrible living conditions. Some academics suggest that the replacement system, Custody and Education camps, are largely the same as these. Religious and political activists held in legal education facilities previously reported forced labor occurred in pretrial detention and outside of penal sentences."
Jill,1997 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"In 1981, I became a statistic: I became a runaway teen, escaping sexual and physical abuse. When I ran away, I no longer had a place to live with my parents nor did I have a living relative who would take me in. Filled with a sense of bravado, invincibility and bravery, I left, figuring that my life couldn’t be in any more jeopardy than it already was at what I’d called home. In leaving I hoped there would be no more broken bones, no more sexual abuse, no more rationalizations of molestation and cruelty. When I left that day, I had no more than a change of clothes and under one hundred dollars. No longer did my name, childhood identity, school or grades matter. All became irrelevant in the world I was about to enter. As a runaway teen, your old concerns quickly disappear and are replaced by new, life threatening ones. There were no familiar faces and no one who wanted to talk to a teenage girl who was homeless; even my name became irrelevant. Instead, my concerns were more pragmatic, involving finding food, shelter, water and passing time without the money to financially support these needs. I’d resorted to sleeping in cemeteries, and stealing food out of dumpsters and from convenience stores in order to eat. Getting drinking water and a chance to wash my face became quests of endurance. I had to hide from security guards, store and restaurant employees and others who didn’t want a homeless girl “loitering.” As a runaway teen, I was viewed as something less than human. Still, it was safer than going home. Into my hunger, loneliness and desperation came a man named Bruce. Attractive, well dressed and very charismatic, he approached me in a suburban mall and offered to “help” me. He could provide me with food, shelter, clothing, work—and I really wanted to work. I wanted desperately to be off the street and to have something to do. In essence he knew exactly how to manipulate a desperate teenage girl with his promises to fulfill all my needs. The manipulation began within minutes of meeting him. When I questioned whether or not this “work” was prostitution, he retracted the offer and began to walk away. Desperate, I ran after him, pleading with him to give me another chance and to forgive my insult. He brought me into his “office” (which was actually his cellar) blindfolded under the pretense of not wanting competitors to know his location in case I was a spy for them. I put my fear aside and agreed to being blindfolded because I needed what he was offering. When we went into his “office,” he explained that I had to audition for the job and should step on the stage and raise my hands. When I did so, I felt leather straps being put around my wrists but didn’t understand what was going on. He pulled my pants down and my shirt up, leaving me virtually naked. When I tried to stop him from undressing me, the reality of what was happening became very clear. He shoved out the wooden box I was standing on, and I was left hanging in mid air naked, suspended by my wrists. It was the beginning of my “training” for a position as a prostitute that catered to “clients,” who wanted to act on their violent bondage/torture fantasies. While still hanging from my wrists, I was told that unless I agreed then to sign a contract, I would never be let down. This threat was followed, while I was still hanging by being hit, punched, whipped and penetrated with a beer bottle. I could barely breathe, and my arms, wrists and shoulders were screaming in pain. I gave up and agreed to sign, at which point I was let down, bound behind my back, gagged and blindfolded, thrown into a tiny closet under the cellar stairs without food or water and left there. Bruce did not come back until after what seemed like a couple of days, at which time he freed my hands and told me to sign by his finger while I was still blindfolded. What I signed was what is known in these “rape and snuff” circles as a slave contract. By doing so I was essentially agreeing that I was no longer a human being, but rather, a slave, whose sole purpose in life was the fulfillment of Bruce’s desires and those of his “clients.” The contract took away my right to feel, to speak without approval, to have emotions. In it, I agreed to do anything that I was told and to accept any punishment or training he determined necessary. What followed next—the “training”—was months of being tortured, starved, dehydrated, sensory deprived and raped. I was supposed to learn how to “want” to be a slave and “want” to be punished. To that end, I had to beg for everything, using phrases that Bruce had written. I had to apologize for being alive, had to thank him for each act of torture and beg for more. If I resisted, the punishments got worse, until I gave up and agreed. Once he was satisfied that my training period was nearing the end he began to refer me to “clients” who would use my body for their fetishes. They paid Bruce to rent my body to rape in as many ways as they could devise without killing me. I was held underwater in toilets or bathtubs, whipped, hung, shocked with electrical current, and paid to have me tell them how much I was enjoying it. One of my early clients portrayed himself as a nice guy who was going to help me escape, which I agreed to try. It turned out to be a test of my “loyalty,” the failure of which resulted in a savage night of gang rape, beating, being hung by my wrists and ankles, and an attempt to hang me by my neck which left me physically scarred and damaged my vocal chords for life. I nearly died that night and never tried to escape again. For three years I was forced to let men rape me for Bruce’s profit. During that time, I’d nearly been killed several times, including Bruce’s failed attempt to perform an abortion on me after I’d become pregnant. In 1982, I entered a suburban Los Angeles hospital bleeding extensively from my vaginal area. On my wrists, ankles and neck were burns, cuts and scars. Having been hung from the ceiling by my wrists while my pimp attempted to abort a child that I was pregnant with, I was in shock and nearly unconscious when I was brought into the hospital. A broken, long neck beer bottle had been shoved into my vagina as the object to remove the fetus. Needless to say, it didn’t work out. The fetus remained in my womb but the abortion attempt nearly killed me. Fearing retaliation from my pimp, I didn’t communicate to the doctors what had actually transpired, but instead, remained silent allowing my pimp’s explanation of my abortion attempt to go unchallenged. Had these doctors given any thought their ethical oaths it should have occurred to them that the bruises, scars, strangulation marks, etc. were inconsistent with attempting to abort my own child. Exactly how did I destroy my larynx attempting to abort a child? How did I self-inflict leather strap burn marks around my wrists and ankles? Since I was an in-patient for three days, why wasn’t a mental health professional sent to talk to me? Why was I questioned only in the presence of my pimp who was masquerading as my older brother, who was pretending to help his psychotic little sister? Had I been questioned alone and placed in the psychiatric ward away from him, perhaps the outcome would have been different. When we left a Midwestern city, I was thrown into the trunk of a car and taken across country. After being left in the trunk for long periods of time in the southwest desert in July, I became sick from dehydration. At one point this pimp took me out of the car on a remote road in the desert, handcuffed me, tied me by my neck to the bumper of his car and told me he was going to drag me until I was nothing but hair and a grease stain. This fate was guaranteed unless I agreed to remain totally compliant. Arriving at an Arizona truck stop, he pulled me out of the car, took off the blindfold and shackles and told me to walk with him into the truck stop and get a Pepsi. Weak from fatigued, dehydration and exhaustion, I couldn’t walk. I became violently ill on the brick patio of the truck stop. EMS was called to the scene. I was violently ill, dirty from head to toe, and had sores on both my wrists from the handcuffs and the corners of my mouth from being gagged for days. Did they call the police? No. They accepted his explanation of the death of “our parents” and his care taking of his schizophrenic little sister. Why didn’t they ask questions? Why did they only treat the symptoms of heat exhaustion and not ask how I got to that point? Why did the lady getting into her Cadillac with her husband not help me as the pimp was tying my hands behind my back and putting me back into the trunk in plain view? These incidents are not meant to shock, but to illustrate the reality of my day-to-day life. Bruce and his “clients” inflicted every torture imaginable on me, forcing me to do disgusting, humiliating things which have had a devastating effect on my mind, my body and my soul. In 1984, my captivity came to an abrupt end. Bruce was arrested on unrelated charges, and I was able to escape after he’d been handcuffed and taken away. The police who arrested Bruce offered me no support, despite finding a young girl locked in a closet, bound gagged and blindfolded. Even my request for a female officer to speak to was denied. The police told me that there were there to execute a warrant and that I’d better shut up or I was going to be arrested, too. I wasn’t even 18 yet. Taking whatever money I could find in the house, I left immediately, taking a taxi to the airport and flying to the first destination available with the amount of money I had. After arriving in the new city, I found a cheap hotel and literally slept for days. The face I saw in the mirror when I awoke was hardly like the one I’d seen at age 14. I’d lost a third of my body weight. My once thick, long hair had fallen out in clumps and was now thin, fragile and lifeless. Emotionally, I was still stunned, lost in my own world, trying to readjust to a life that suddenly left me free but with no place to go and no one to turn to. Sleep was filled with nightmares, daytime with flashbacks and raging paranoia of being located by Bruce. After three years of eating dog food and being forced to beg for it, I was unaccustomed to eating anything normal and struggled with anorexia. In essence, I still didn’t exist as anything more than a slave, except I was an escaped slave. It has been more than a decade since then. In many ways, I’ve recovered, having eventually regained enough sanity to get a job and hold it. The physical injuries either healed or scarred, and I learned to compensate. But having survived this experience doesn’t mean I’ve become safe from it. Depression is still part of my life, as is shame, fear and a strong drive for self-destruction. I still feel like I’m crazy and fear that I’m a burden to my friends, a failure as an employee and that I’m destined to again be homeless, vulnerable and alone. There are issues on which I’m working towards recovery: an integral part of my recovery is speaking out about what happened to me, what I faced as a runaway teen, and what I face even to this day trying to live with the memory of what I survived. I write this story so that maybe someone who hears it will somehow be able to avoid the pain that was forced on me and for others to know that things like I experienced really do happen—and they can happen to anyone’s daughter, sister, girlfriend, niece or wife. Through whatever fluke, I escaped without having any sexually transmitted diseases, but there were other serious consequences. My ability to have children was destroyed, my voice is a raspy shell of its former self from being choked with ropes, belts, hands, etc. There are extensive and deep scars many places on my body. Emotionally, the effects were worse. Flashbacks, nightmares and depression have been constant battles since my escape. It has taken a great deal of therapy and support from friends for me to evolve to a point where I’m able to move on. It has also seriously impacted my ability to have and maintain relationships. Until recently, my relationships were dominated by failure. Many ‘romantic’ relationships turned out to be with abusive men. In the rare instances that I found a quality person who did love me, I usually destroyed the relationship with my actions. It took many years for me to deprogram the need to self-destruct. Recently, I’ve evolved to the point where I’m no longer seeking suicide through self-destruction. Instead I’m working on living. On maintaining the friendships and relationships with the really awesome people who are in my life now. I have some really wonderful, supportive friends who I love, and I believe love me. A great deal of therapy has gone into believing that I’m worth these quality friends and can maintain the relationship. I’ve hurt too many people in the past through my low self-esteem and self-destruction. But going forward, it’s my goal to see beyond the horrors of the past and fatalistic programming, and instead focus on the future and on being authentic to myself. And on a commitment to living. ","Born and raised in the US, Jill was trafficked into sex slavery from her home state of Ohio in 1981 at the age of 14. She made one attempt to escape, which led to punishment so severe that she never tried again. Contacting her family was out of the question, in part because she had left behind a dangerous home environment to become one of between 1.3 and 2.8 million runaway and homeless youth in America. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation by traffickers: the Department of Justice estimates that 293,000 youth are at risk. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) estimates that “1 in 5 of the 11,800 runways reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2015 were likely sex trafficking victims.” Jill notes that after her liberation from slavery, she “still didn’t exist as anything more than a slave, except I was an escaped slave.” Jill still felt “less than human” after her three-year captivity ended, and struggled to recognize herself as a human individual. But narrating her story, she explains, is “an integral part of my recovery.”"
Jing,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Domestic slavery,Philippines (trafficked from) Domestic slavery,Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Jing. I am 21 years old. I have four siblings, one older sister, an older brother and one younger sister and younger brother. When I was nine years old my father died. He was an electrician. After he died my family had no money, not even enough to continue to send us to school. My older sister, who was 11, was working for our neighbor at the time as a helper. Our neighbor told our mother that if she would send my sister and me to work in Cavite (Manila) as domestic helpers that our employers there would pay for us to go to school. My mother agreed and within a couple of weeks we were taken by boat to Manila by our neighbor. Once we got to Manila I was taken to our neighbor’s daughter’s house and my sister was taken to our neighbor’s sister’s house. We were immediately sent to work in the house but our employers never sent us to school as we were promised. I didn’t like the job there and I didn’t get along with my employer. After three years of working there I was sent to another house in Manila. I was hired by a Chinese man to be a ya-ya, I was 12-years-old. At first my work was okay but I was not allowed to leave the house. Soon the Chinese man’s son kept coming around and touching me in places that I didn’t like. It made me feel very uneasy. It was a hard time for me and I had just experienced my first “flow”. I could not tell anyone about him touching me because I could not leave the house. After a few months the son raped me in the bedroom. He took my virginity. I went to tell the mother of the house what had happened to me, but she only slapped me on the face and told me not to tell lies. I then went to the father of the house but he just said, “Wala lang yan. Maliligo ka lang!” (No big deal, just take a bath!). After that the father began “selling” me to his friends. They would take me out to the clubs. At the end of the night the father would sometimes give me P150-200 to keep quiet. I tried to write to my sister to let her know what was happening to me and finally I succeeded and eventually met her in a park. I was too scared to leave with her, she said she didn’t know how to help me, and all my possessions and money were still in the house. After three years I became very sick and the father took me to the hospital. The hospital said that there was nothing they could do to help my sickness. The father told me that I was of no use anymore and that I should go back home. I was 15-years-old. I returned home with my savings of about P3000. The money did not last long; it was all gone in three months. Now I am back living with my family.","Jing was enslaved in the Philippines, sent to the nation’s capital, Manilla, to become a domestic servant and receive education, which she was not given. Later she was sexually abused and prostituted from when she was 12 years old. It was only after getting seriously ill that she was able to return home. In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography. The Philippines is an international hub for prostitution and commercial sex tourism – a highly profitable businesses for organised criminal syndicates. The demand for sex with children among both local and foreign men has continued to fuel child sex tourism."
Joyce,2002 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Was doing migrant work since I was nine or ten. Went to school with Mormons. Only black in the school. Picking tomatoes, cucumbers, stringbeans. Wages still the same, and now I’m 43 years old. It ain’t went up no more than about 10, 15 cents. Lake Wells, near Orlando, is where I was mainly working. With my husband. Worked many years on the camp. And they be beating on you and pistol-whuppin’ you. Leaky showers, the water be cold. Half-fed people, unlivable camps. Ain’t no sheets on the bed. The mattress don’t be fit to sleep on. The food is slop. Some of the time it be cold. For lunch, they bring you a little sandwich, sauce, and baloney. It already melted in the sun. It make your blood pressure high. Treated like a dog. They used to spit in the food. Once the Bonds girl wrung out a tampon into the food. Got you way down a clay dirt road, mosquitoes eat you up. You so far back out there in the woods you can’t walk to town. Never got paid a cent. You go to bed at 9 or 10 o’clock. Sun up to sun down. They have you working in the rain, at 5am. Sometimes till 9pm with the truck lights on picking sweet potatoes in North Carolina. Locked up each night in a compound with barbed wire, guarded by dogs. They’d make a count of everyone before bedtime and they’d be walking with a rifle outside the hall when people slept. All the men stayed in the bullpit. Wind blows and turns over the trailer. They take you to town in a van, they count you. They stay right there with you when you go to the store. The town’s so small there’s nowhere to run. They’d just come get you, and they’d tell the other crew leader man that they done stole their people. Once they took me to Atlanta, to get homeless men by offering crack. I was tired, didn’t wanna go work in the fields that day. I was telling those men how we had swimming pools and how nice the camp was. Pool tables, this that and the other. Sometime around ‘91 or ‘92 we decided we needed to get away. We made a plan. At night, when we could, we went into the peach fields, started stowing our belongings. Got another camp leader to help us with that. The guards went and drank at night. When Huey said start running, you start running. The dogs started chasing, I fell in a ditch, Huey fell with me. The cars were chasing and the dogs were chasing, and we went to some other camp, and the guys at that second camp protected us. The way the brothers got caught was a guy came on the camp pretending to be a worker, but he was a cop or something. The big farmer, they’re the ones making the money. Maybe a contractor, like, say, Goldteeth, off one truck of sweet potatoes, he made $10,000. He probably makes 60 or 70 thousand a season. He’s got his own camp now, eight miles outside Benson.","Joyce is an African American woman who was born in Ocala, Florida. She subsisted on migrant work from the age of nine, and from 1985 was enslaved by the Bonds family, who operated a ring of labor camps from Florida to the Carolinas. After seven years in bondage she escaped with her husband Huey. Sometimes the experiences of 21st-century slaves encompass not only the narrator’s turn from slavery to freedom, but also a reversal for their enslavers. In 1993, members of the Bonds family were charged with conspiracy to hold workers in a state of peonage, distribution of crack cocaine, and two violations of the federal Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. The Bonds were released from prison in 2000, and Joyce recently received word of their fate: while she had experienced stasis and entrapment (“there’s nowhere to run”), the Bonds now spend their days trapped by the side of a highway, picking up cans for a living. In her narrative, Joyce further inverts slavery’s power dynamic by using the vague and threatening third-person pronoun “they” to counter her own dehumanization (“treated like a dog”)."
Julie,2005 (Narrative date) ,Forced marriage Sexual exploitation,Philippines (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Philippines (slavery location),"My name is Julie. When I was 17-years-old a friend of my family introduced me to a “legal recruiter”. I had just graduated high school but my family could not afford to send me to college, so this chance for a job seemed great. The friend of my families had also brought my friend Carmen along. She was only 16-years-old and had graduated with me from high school. We both talked to the recruiter and she showed us her license and other official papers to prove that she was a “legal recruiter.” I still don’t know if the license and papers were real or fake. She told us that we had a chance to go to Japan to wait on tables and welcome customers. She made sure our parents knew that it would be at a “good club, which only sells liquor, and sometimes even has singing and dancing shows.” As a show of good faith she even gave each of our families P500 as an advance. She said that we would be making much more money than that and we would be able to send most of the money home to our families. We were so excited and when we decided to leave with her she even gave us tooth brushes, toothpaste, and other things we needed for our travels to Manila. We left home from the nearest major port at 7am on Friday morning. When we arrived in Manila we were immediately taken to a house and were not allowed to leave. Our food was brought to the house and we were forced to exercise everyday. We were never allowed to go into the sun. We were told that staying out of the sun would make us lighter and more pretty. We were also taught how to use cosmetics. They trained us on how to dance, in a sexy modern way, how to handle a tray and to sit with customers. It was a strictly controlled routine. After about one month I began to get a bad feeling, I thought to myself, “Why could we not go out and why did we have to dance this way?” I decided that I was going to try to escape from the house. I asked Carmen to come with me, but she said, “No, I really want to go to Japan”. I waited for my chance and after another month I got it. I had become friends with the “mayordoma” so one night I told her that I really needed some sanitary napkins, that I had started my “flow”. For the first time she allowed me to go out by myself, but she said she would be timing me. I never went to the store. As soon as I was out of the house I ran to the boat dock and hid until the next evening, when I knew a boat was leaving for home. I had sneaked some money out and paid for my trip back home. I was so happy to return to my family. Soon after I married my boyfriend. I now have a family and my husband drives a motor cab. My friend Carmen did make it to Japan. She had used her sister’s data to get a passport and the agent took care of everything else. She arrived in Japan with a group of girls from around the Philippines. She was forced into prostitution and was able to send a little money home for the next two years. After two years of being prostituted she became pregnant and returned home. The money she had sent back did not last very long. She decided to leave her baby with her family and return to Japan.","Immediately after graduating from high school, Julie was enslaved in Manilla where she danced and entertained customers. She escaped and returned home, but reflects on her friend Carmen who wanted to go to Japan, as they had originally been promised, where she was enslaved in prostitution.In the Philippines, women and children are subjected to sexual exploitation in brothels, bars, and massage parlours, online, as well as in the production of pornography.

Kaew,1997 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Thailand (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Japan (slavery location),"I had three kids, my husband drank, and we had no money, so I had to do something. I went back and forth several times trying to make money, leaving my children with my mother. The agent in Bangkok decided I was beautiful enough to go to Japan, though I had to get a nose job first and they kept messing it up; they had to do it four times to get it right. The agent wanted me to get my eyes done too, but I refused. Other women got plastic surgery for their breasts, eyes, or other body parts. Women who were not beautiful enough were given a bus ticket home to their village. They used me because I was older, so it was easier for me. I got five passports for other women—each time getting married to change my surname. If I think about it now, the agents were very, very clever. They could even make birth certificates; they could do everything. They were so clever, and in Japan the brokers are even more clever. After seven months, I threatened to go home because I wasn’t making any money, so they sent me to Japan. My escort was a Western man named Gary. He took the women to Japan one by one. He had many passports and worked with the airline. He had a visa that allowed him to go back and forth between Japan and Thailand through his banana business. He was handsome and dressed up and spoke Thai. I told the immigration officials that I was going to visit a banana factory in Japan to see how it worked and I had a letter from the company in Thailand. Gary had 150 bai [$12,000] with him. Gary and I were separated by the immigration officers at the airport and asked questions about the company, but we had prepared before. I had practiced for two or three nights before I left, and learned to write my new name in English. At Narita airport, someone was waiting for me and took the clothes and jewelry that they had given me to wear. The person took me to the mama’s house in Tokyo. There were lots of women there and people came to choose women and buy them. I was bought on the third day, and told that my price was 380 bai [$30,000]. After three or four days of working at the snack bar, I realized how much 380 bai was. The other girls said to me: “that’s a lot of debt and you’re old; you’ll never pay it off.” Then I prayed that it would only take six or seven months to pay it off, and I went with all of the clients I could. The mama said to me: “don’t let your period come, or you’ll never finish paying your debt.” The boss would tell me to go with a man, and I couldn’t refuse. Girls were beaten if they didn’t agree, and the owner was close to the Yakuza so he knew how to fight. Women were also fined for coming back late, fighting with each other, or not agreeing to sit with a client, so I did what I was told. Other women were beaten so badly they had to take days off; I wasn’t beaten or given fines because I obeyed. Some clients were good, and some were abusive. I had up to three clients a night because I needed to pay off my debt, and after six months the mama said I had paid off 250 bai [$20,000]. I kept track in a notebook and this sounded about right—I was paying back about 40 or 50 bai [$3000-4000] per month, and I could have paid off the rest of the debt soon. But while I was working, I met a man who was a friend of the owner. He came to the snack bar often, but he never took women out, he just talked to them. I had to talk to him, and at first I was upset because I knew he wasn’t going to pay to take me out, but then he gave me tips just to sit and talk. He told the owner that he liked me and asked to buy out my contract, and the owner agreed since it was his friend. Usually, they didn’t allow men to buy women out. So he paid the 130 bai [$10,000] that I owed and set me up in an apartment. He gave me money, and I also continued to work at the same snack bar, but I wasn’t in debt so I earned money. Women working without debt still had to go with a customer if he picked her out, but I didn’t have to try flirting and all anymore because I wasn’t so worried about money. On Tuesdays, I spent the day with my boyfriend, and the other days I worked. I continued to work there for almost two years after my debt was paid, and then I was arrested. All of the local police came to the snack bar, just like in Thailand, and they were very nice—there were no problems. But then police came from Tokyo. They were cleaning up in preparation for the Olympics in Nagano, and an undercover police officer from Tokyo came to the snack bar. She said she was a tour operator from Tokyo—there were a lot of tours from Tokyo—and that she wanted to see the women. When the women lined up, the officer took out her ID and arrested us all. I always kept ten bai [$980] in my pocket to pay for my ticket to Thailand in case I was arrested and deported, so I had that with me. I also had my passport—the mama had kept it while I was in debt, but after my contract was paid I carried it at all times. I gave my money and passport to the officer, and she let me get my stuff, and then I was taken to jail. Five days later I returned to Thailand. I didn’t have to stay long because I had my passport and enough money for the trip home. When I left, I just got onto the plane like other passengers. There were 24 of us arrested together at the snack bar, and we were sent back to Thailand in groups of three or four. Whenever I think too much, I get sad. But then I remember when I could only feed my children rice and soup. My husband didn’t help, so my kids had to stay with my mother while I went to earn money. That guy was physically abusive too. He would come home drunk and beat me. I tried to work it out with him. But things never changed. The oldest son knows everything I did. He remembers before, knows the choices I’ve made. I worry that my children will be embarrassed by me, by the fact that I was a prostitute. But I tell my kids: “I had many men on my chest and I cried, but I closed my eyes and thought of my kids.” I don’t know if they really listen or if it’s in one ear and out the other. It’s all good luck or not. It was good luck that I had a good snack bar, and bad luck that I got arrested, and good luck that I found a good boyfriend. If you talk to different women, you will get very different stories. Some women start to gamble, spend their money on hosts, and drink. It gets difficult to remember why you’re there, for the young especially. Some are less obedient than me, so they have problems. The snack bar next door to me was run by the Yakuza so it was worse. Some women are killed or followed if they escape, or even if they are arrested. Some are followed to Thailand, so many don’t go back to their families right away, but wait. Now I want to go back to Japan to visit, but only legally. When I was in Japan, I had no rights because the job was illegal. I’d like to go back to see, independently. I’m trying to go legally, with a passport, so that I’m allowed to be there.","Kaew entered Japan on a tourist visa in May 1992 at the age of 31, after meeting an agent in Bangkok. She was kept in a “snack bar,” or brothel, in Nagano prefecture, west of Tokyo. Of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 individuals trafficked across international borders each year, some 80 percent are women and girls. Kaew was one of the thousands of women trafficked annually out of Thailand for sexual exploitation. The major destinations include Japan, Malaysia, Bahrain, Australia, Singapore, and the US. Internal trafficking occurs within the country as well, usually from northern Thailand (where hill tribe women and girls are denied Thai citizenship). In Japan, where she was enslaved, women are trafficked from Thailand, the Philippines, Russia, and Eastern Europe, and on a smaller scale from Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Burma, and Indonesia."
Katya (Narrative 2),2012 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Ukraine (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"My name is Katya. I was born on [redacted]. I am currently 20 years old and was born in Ukraine. In the summer of 2003, I lived with both my mother and grandmother. My grandmother was old and she became paralyzed, stopped eating, and was unable to use the bathroom on her own. In a short time, she became senile. She needed daily care. My mother worked as an accountant and was making around $130-150 per month, which absolutely was not enough for three people. I was studying as a freshman at the Ukraine State University, majoring in physical education and sports. Every day after my classes, I had trained in athletics and pole vaulting. My mother started having problems with her heart, blood pressure and had chronic bronchitis, which made it difficult for her to work. After I finished my first year at the University, I decided that I need to look for a job, as we had nothing to eat, we did not have money, we were in need. Together with my best friend, [name redacted], we looked through the newspaper for jobs. We went to apply to be waitresses to a bar that was just opened in Kiev called “Paradise.” When I arrived at Paradise, I met Vieniamin Yakovlievich, the owner. He told me that I couldn’t be a waitress because I was too short, but that I could be a dancer instead. At that moment, I could not imagine myself in as an exotic dancer. Nevertheless, Vieniamin convinced me by promising me good money, $50-100 a day, which was very good in the Ukraine, and also to work on the days that I wanted. Instead of Paradise, Vienamin sent me to work at another one of his clubs, “Vegas.” I guess he owns a lot of clubs. I worked at Vegas three days a week. My mother did not even suspect that I danced. I did not want her to know about that. I told her that I worked as a waitress with [name redacted]. In one sad day, on November 18, 2003, my grandmother died, a person whom I loved very much. There were just two of us left, my mom and I. On the same day I had a conversation with Vieniamin, he told me that I have a chance in my life to help my mother, to earn money and see the United States. He said that it would be like summer break for me, for only 3-5 months. He told me that I would work in the U.S. as a waitress, and that he would provide a place to live. He promised me good money, which I really needed at that time for me and my mother. In December 2003, Vieniamin introduced me to Michael Aranov and Alex Maksimenko to talk more about going to work in the United States. I knew that Alex was Vieniamin’s son. I did not know anything about Michael. I had seen them before at Vegas. Michael told me that I should find an English language tutor to learn English. He paid for my English lessons, which lasted until April 2004. In April 2004, Vieniamin gave me the address of a company called “Kolizey.” That company helped students to go abroad for summer break: to rest, to earn some money, and to see the country. When I met with Kolizey representatives they gave me an option to choose the place of work. They also told me it would cost around $1300, which included Kolizey services and tickets to the destination country. Vienamin gave me money for this program and told me it would not be a problem, and that I did not have to pay him back. Vienamin told me to pick “Beauty Search Incorporated” to work for in the U.S. at my next Kolizey appointment, and Kolizey agreed. I was told I had to go through the American embassy first. Before going to the embassy, Michael called me at home to prepare me for my embassy interview. He gave me questions and answers that could have been asked at the embassy in English. I continued to work at Vegas during this process, and Vieniaimin, Alex and Michael kept talking to me about America, and its future promise and the money I would earn. Only now I understand what good psychologists they were and how they were pressuring me. Shortly before my scheduled departure to the U.S., I received a call from Kolizey, and they told me that “Beauty Search Incorporated” to which I initially applied was not valid, and that they would not let me go. [Name redacted], another girl who worked for Veinaimin and was also traveling to the U.S., and I both went to Kolizey to try to find a different company to work for. Kolizey offered to fly us to Virginia Beach to work as waitresses. We had an interview and the next day, at 2 pm, purchased the plane tickets. The flight would be out of Kiev-London-Washington. They said there would be a bus waiting for us at the airport to take us to Virginia Beach where we would work. I called Michael and told him that I could not go to Detroit. He sounded upset at first, but then told me not to worry and go to Virginia Beach anyway. In May 2004, [name redacted] and I flew to the U.S. When we got to the airport in Washington, to my surprise, I saw Michael at the airport. He told us that we were going with him, that everything worked out, that we did not need to worry, and that he would “take care of everything.” Michael bought us bus tickets to Detriot. [Name redacted] and I rode the bus for a long time; it was very scary, not knowing English language, and the area frightened us. When we arrived in Detroit, Vienaimin, Alex, and Michael met us. They kept talking about how lucky we were and how they were going to take care of everything. They brought us to a hotel, and in one moment everything changed. Once in the hotel, they told us that for bringing us to the U.S., we owed them money. Specifically, Vieniamin told us that we had to give them back $12,000 each within two months. [Name redacted] and I were in shock from learning what we got into, but that was not everything; the next thing they told us that the following week we have to go to work and there everything would be explained to us. They bought a phone card for us and told us to call our parents. However, during our conversations with our parents, then and later, Alex or Michael were always present, listening to what we said. Within a week, Alex and Michael bought strip clothes and shoes for us. They found an apartment for [name redacted] and me, but also had their own keys to it. They told us that we were to work in a bar called “Cheetahs” from 2 pm to 2 am, two shifts from Monday to Saturday. They warned us not to tell anyone anything about ourselves, not to tell where we were from and where we lived, and which stores we went to. They said that if they were to find out we talked to anyone, we would have problems with our health and well-being. It was hard work. We worked at Cheetah’s Monday through Saturday, 12-hours a day. After the work we had to give all of our money to Michael and Alex. I was very tired and never wanted to do anything. I became depressed very soon. Monday through Saturday, I would wake up at 12 pm, make breakfast, wash, put make-up on, fixed my hair, and at 1 pm a car would be waiting for us at the door. Alex or Michael always took us to work and brought us back home. We worked till 2 o’clock at night; at 2:30 am a car at the club, we gave all the money and went home. Often after coming home, Alex or Michael would force us to have sex with them. Michael would have sex with me, and Alex would have sex with [name redacted]. We argued with them about this, but it was useless. We also fought about the money. Alex and Michael kept telling us that they wanted each of us to make $1000 a day, and if we didn’t they would yell and scream at us. And then around 4:00-5:00 am we would go to bed with a hope for a better tomorrow. Everyday, I earned between $400 to $1000, but I did not feel I made money, since I never saw it. On Sundays Alex and Michael told us it was our “day off.” We were still not rid of them on Sundays. At 1 or 2 pm, Alex and Michael, sometimes both, would drive to our apartment and take us out for our manicures and pedicures. Then, they would take us to the mall, they would give us some cash for clothes, perfume and makeup. We would have to give any money back we did not spend. We were not allowed to talk to anyone else or tell them about ourselves. Then, Alex and Michael would take us to a restaurant with them, where they would make fun of us. For example, they would tell me I wasn’t holding the utensils right, or make fun of something I said and just laugh at me. In September, [name redacted], another girl from Ukraine, arrived in Detroit to work for Alex and Michael and to be a dancer with us. [Name redacted] and I told her about what happened to us. I think she was shocked. Later, sometime in November, another girl, [name redacted], arrived from the Ukraine to work for Alex and Michael. We told her everything as well. [Name redacted] and [name redacted] lived together in an apartment in another building, in a similar “arrangement” to my situation with [name redacted]. Some time after [name redacted] arrived, all four of us became very ill. I think we all had bronchitis. I had a high fever, coughing, headache, body aches, and I lost my voice and could not speak. But Alex and Michael had no feelings and made us work anyway. They would scream and yell at us until we gave in, always. I remember once, I bought an outfit at the club for $40 with money I earned that same night, and told Michael that a customer bought it for me. After work, Michael took [name redacted] and I to the house that he and Alex lived in, and locked us in the basement. They set us down on the couch, yelled at us, threatened us, and raised their arms as if they were going to hit us. They yelled about money we owed them, and said that if we did not make enough money for them, they would sell us to a prostitution house and get their money. They kept questioning me about the outfit I bought, and when I finally said I bought it, Michael hit me hard across my face with his hand. I had stars in my eyes, then it was dark, and only then I realized that he hit me. I could not feel my face. [Name redacted] and I cried, asked to let us go home, yelled that we were tired. However, for them, we were not people, only dollar signs. Michael and Alex arranged for [name redacted] and I to live in an apartment with a TV, buy us nice clothes from the mall, and get our nails done. But we did not have a right to choose where we lived, right of freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of actions. Alex and Michael had keys to our apartments. They controlled all of our movement and travel. They watched us and listened when we called our parents. They didn’t let us make friends or tell anyone anything about ourselves. We couldn’t keep any of the money we earned. We couldn’t ask anyone for help.  fter six months of slavery, [name redacted] and I thought we could go home. We estimated we had earned enough to pay Alex and Michael back for what we “owed” them. We asked Alex and Michael if we could go back to the Ukraine. Their response was that we “would break their business down,” and that they would not allow that. Once I asked Michael to take me to the airport to go home. He didn’t really reply - he said something about it not being his business. But the next day when they came to pick us up to take us to work, Michael told me to stay home and wait for him. Later, he let himself into our apartment with his key, and he made me sit down in the living room. He asked me why I was not happy. I told him I wanted to go home, and I want the money I earned. Michael told me I owed him a lot of money, and that I did not [have] any money, and that there was no way back home. I started to cry, and argued with him about this. He became enraged, and ran towards me, raised his foot at me, but kicked the boom box next to me instead, and broke it. I understood I could not solve the problem this way, and never raised this issue with him again. I had a young client at the club, who came to see me once a week. I used his phone to call Ukraine; I told my mom what was going on. My mom told me to take my things and run. The entire time I was working for Alex and Michael, I never got enough sleep. [Name redacted] and I worked on our escape plan for a long time. She said she would talk to one of her clients, Jeff, to help us. On February 12th, 2005 after the night shift, at 6 o’clock in the morning, Jeff’s car was standing outside our apartment. He took us to the Immigration Service, and that’s how we got rid of Alex and Michael. I told Immigration my story. I was still scared, however, since Alex and Michael have a lot of connections in the Ukraine. Since leaving the situation with Alex and Michael, I have been telling my story to Lou de Baca of the US Department of Justice, and Kelli Hodges of the FBI during interviews. It has sometimes been difficult, but I know it is important. I feel like going back to the Ukraine would be like going back to my own grave. Vieniamin is still there with all of his clubs and associates. I am scared he would hurt me if I returned. The police there would never protect us, as they are corrupt. Vieniamin got away with so much there. Since running away from Alex and Michael, I have fallen in love with this country. The laws work here, police are good, and there are people here who will help people like me. The government attorneys and FBI agents I work with really care about me and my case. I am trusting people for the first time. I feel safe and protected. At the present time I study English at Truman College in Chicago. I plan to take computer classes soon. I lived in Kiev, Ukraine for 19 years. During that time I never trusted the country’s laws, police or people. Here, in one year, I have trust and I was proven that in this country the laws work. This country can protect me and provide me a future. My country will not guarantee that I will stay alive after what happened. I hope I can stay in America.","“Katya” submitted this narrative as part of her application for a T-visa, which the US government has created to aid victims of trafficking. Some parts of the narrative have been redacted by her attorney and her name has been changed. In 2016, the Walk Free Foundation, Gallup, and Polaris undertook survey research to better understand the general awareness of the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC)’s hotline number among the American public, through the Gallup U.S. nightly public opinion survey. Ultimately, the results suggest that a relatively small proportion of the American public are informed about it, with only 6.7% indicating they know the NHTRC specifically and 12% aware that there is a hotline focused on human trafficking. This indicates that the 5,544 cases reported in 2015 is likely a small proportion of the actual prevalence of human trafficking in the United States.

Kimete,2005 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Sexual exploitation,Albania (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Italy (slavery location),"I was born in 1985 in a village in southwest Albania. My biological parents had divorced several months before I was born. Being unable to raise me, my father took my sister who was four, and my mother took me to an orphanage where I stayed until I was four years old. After that, my mother married another man who had four other children and gave birth to another child, my second sister. This second marriage lasted only two years. Again my mother took the only child she had with her and went to live with another man who had no children of his own. This time she decided to take me out of the orphanage. We were four people living in a shack. This husband of my mother did not have any affection for us; he was always quarreling with my mother, saying he could not stand me being around, and he suspected my mother of continuing to have contacts with my real father. He hit us children, and my mother did not work or provide anything for the family. I had three other siblings from this marriage: two brothers and one sister. My parents did not have money to buy books, so I was not able to attend school regularly. Besides, I was told to pasture the cow, so I was not left time to learn or do my homework. After the third grade, my stepfather started to build a house, and I helped him although I was a small child. The relatives of my mother did not help her because they disliked her for her divorces; we were out of money most of the time. Once, with the help of my aunt, I met my real father, and at that time my stepfather got so angry that he treated me as if I had committed a crime. It was 7.30 in the evening, and I did not know where to go. I came to Tirana to tell my aunt, and she brought me back home. When I turned 16 my mother and my father arranged for me to marry a man who was 33 years old and mentally ill. He took drugs every day. After some months he was hospitalized, and I turned back home feeling ashamed, crying all the time for my fate, and thinking that my parents did not love me. Some months later a salesperson came to buy the products of our garden. He came in to have coffee with my parents and asked for me when he saw me looking depressed. He said that he had a nephew who was living in another city and whose wife had died during childbirth. He said that he could arrange for me to marry him. That same day he brought this so-called nephew for us to see him. The next day my parents went to that city to see if the nephew’s family lived there, but they did not find anybody at that address. When the salesperson came back again, my parents expressed that they felt he was lying, but he got a taxi and took my parents to that city and showed them a half-finished house, saying that this was his nephew’s house but that his mother was not there because she went to a hospital in Tirana to see her sister. There my parents met only one person, who said that he was the salesperson’s father. My parents were convinced, and that afternoon when the nephew called me he said that his father did not like me, but that it was okay because he had fallen in love with me and he would disobey his father. The next day he took me to a family, introduced them as his relatives, and left me there. These people used to hide me when they had guests in their house. He was telling me that since his father did not agree with our marriage, that we would live better in Italy. He made me a passport and arranged that another person take me to Italy by speedboat. He took a plane because he said he had documents. There in Italy he paid 450 euros [$591] for a house and told me that I had to work to pay for the rent and also to help my parents. He told me he would find a job for me and soon brought home a girl to teach me. When I realized what kind of job he was talking about, I refused, saying to him that when someone loves his wife, it would not be acceptable for him to allow her to do this kind of work. He promised me we would buy a house in Tirana and we would live together in Tirana. I accepted and started working with that girl giving all the profits to him. After a week or so I found a picture of him and his wife and started quarreling with him. He got a telephone call from his father telling him that my mother had made a denunciation and that many persons were arrested, so he had to bring me back. He gave me the ticket and told his brother to bring me back to Durres. A person was waiting for us who took me to his relatives and introduced me. A good man who was their relative felt compassion for me and took me to the police station of my city.   ","Born in Albania, Kimete was trafficked into Italy, where trafficking victims also arrive from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, China, and South America. One NGO estimates that 48 percent of the prostitutes in Italy are from Eastern Europe. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply. "
Kwame,2006 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Ghana (trafficked from),Ghana (slavery location),"I come from Mafi Dugame where I live with my parents. A man came to our village and requested from my parents to take me to help in selling. I didn’t know him. The first time I saw him was when he came to my parents to ask for me. The man mentioned that I was going to be involved in his selling business and I was a bit interested. When we got to Atitekpo, in Yeji, he said he didn’t have any thing to sell but rather we shall be fishing. We woke up around 4am to the river to pull the net into the boat and bring the fish to the riverside by 8am. After delivering the fish we returned back onto the river to work and it’s after all this before we were given food. Then we attended to the fish, mended the nets and returned to fishing after 8am, came back in the afternoon. Then went back to the river about 3pm and returned around 6pm. We didn’t eat on the river, only when we returned were we allowed to eat. We ate banku twice a day, in the afternoon and before we went to bed. They beat us. At times, as a form of punishment, they paddled the boat away from us while on the river and we had to swim a long distance to catch up with them. Sometimes if you were not lucky you drowned in the river. I will inform my parents that where I was sent to work was very bad and full of suffering. I was made to go fishing very early till late in the evening. I was not fed well and was often beaten over little things, at times even made to swim long distances which could lead to my death. I believed I would one day escape. My parents allowed us to come here to suffer, and even when the contract days were up they wouldn’t allow us to leave. My plan was to get the chance to work for another master who would pay me and I could use that money to run away, back to my family. We were informed that the government wanted to collect us and send us back to our families to go to school. Having been released I am very happy. I like the food here much better and I am well treated. I do not have anything to complain about. I hope to go to school and train to become a teacher. I am very much interested in school and given the opportunity, I will pay attention in class so that I can grow to become somebody.","Kwame was trafficked in 1998 and spent eight years with the same master as a slave at Lake Volta. He was rescued in 2006 by the Association of People for Practical Life Education (APPLE), a small nonprofit organization that works directly with the fishermen and children. 
Along Ghana’s Lake Volta, slave children work long hours mending, setting and pulling nets, cleaning and smoking fish, and rowing the fishing boats. Boys as young as six are forced to dive to disentangle nets caught on tree stumps below this large man-made lake. The fishermen tie weights to the children to help them descend more quickly. When the water is too cold or the children get caught in the nets below it is not uncommon to find bodies washed up on the shores. If sick or injured, the children receive no care or treatment. While most of the enslaved children are boys, some girls are used for domestic work and to sell the fish in the market. Like other trafficked girls in Ghana, they are likely to be sexually abused as well.
Lake Volta is one of the world’s largest lakes and used to be a source of fish for both the national and export markets. But in the 1960s a dam slowed the vigorous flow of water and destroyed the fishing potential of nearby communities. Facing a newly impoverished environment, some fishermen began to enslave children rather than pay adult workers. With schooling hard to obtain and family incomes around the starvation level, parents will sometimes agree to let their children go in order to gain an “advance” on their child’s labor. Normally, the fishermen promise that more money will be paid to the parents over the next year. The money never comes. "
Kwasi,2006 (Narrative date),Forced labour,Ghana (trafficked from),Ghana (slavery location),"I am called Kwasi. I was with my father when one of my uncles came to ask for me to stay with him and attend school. When I came he put me in school alright but we normally woke up and went fishing at about 3am, and by the time we returned and I went to school it was already too late. It wasn’t my own decision to go to school late but we often returned very late and this was the routine. The teachers used to get angry and my master finally told me to stop school and concentrate on the fishing. Then we were made to go fishing at about 3am and only returned at about 1pm in the afternoon. My uncle took me with my parents’ consent. But he made my parents believe that I will work and go to school. I was made to fish and farm, including throwing nets, diving, paddling the boat. Apart from the work itself my major difficulty was lack of proper food. We ate very little in the morning or sometimes none at all before going to fish and we were made to work long hours till we get back home before we are allowed to eat again. I will tell my parents that I was suffering a lot where I was sent. I was made to work for long hours and I never had chance to go to school. I had hope that one day my father will come and to bring me back home. I was there one day when my master received a letter from my parents saying that the government is asking for me to come back and attend school. Now I am happy, especially because I no longer have to do the work I used to do. I hope to become a teacher. I believe that if I pay attention in class and I am serious, with God’s help I can become a teacher in the future.  ","Kwasi spent three years in slavery on Lake Volta and was rescued in 2006 by the Association of People for Practical Life Education (APPLE), a small nonprofit organization that works directly with the fishermen and children.

Manju,2001 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sri Lanka (trafficked from),Sri Lanka (slavery location),"I was told that my father left home as soon as I was born. He does not come home even now, but I meet him once in a while—outside home. Father and mother separated over a verbal quarrel. He never hit my mother in front of me. They only argued. One day they had a big argument and he left home. After he left my mother and us, his children, I heard that he had married again. He has children by that woman, they say. He does not come home. They are also living close by. He talks to me sometimes, but he does not come home. When I was young my mother went away to find a job. My mother’s relatives looked after us. My mother was very good at artificial flower making and I, too, liked that. I used to sit by her side and watch her making flowers. I too can make flowers. I like cooking, too; even here I help and enjoy cooking. We, too, have our own house. We built this home, it is enough for us. I liked to go to school. I studied up to the ordinary level. There were many teachers. I liked all my teachers. Nobody hit me. They scold us to make us study well. I don’t mind that. Sometimes they used to hit, even that I think it’s for our own good. I played netball. I go for practices and enjoy playing. Today I am here. Why? Not because I wanted to join, it is no fault of my own at all. I was forcefully taken away into the movement. One day three of us wanted to go to my grandmother’s village. My cousins—the three of us got ready to go. While walking along the road there was a three-wheeler. We wanted the driver to take us to that village, the driver agreed. After a while he drove us into an unknown place and kept us locked in a house, later he forcefully took us to a camp. We told our story but nobody listened. They thought we came to join the movement willingly and now we are making up stories. We were then taken to a training base. There were some others like us who were taken in forcefully. Very often I got hit. They tried in every way to make me stay and I was forced into training. The training was for four months. I was not assigned for fighting. I have to take all the details of any group moving out for fighting, details of all the arms taken, what kind and who is taking it, etc. For the four months I underwent training, I did only the basic physical training. It was difficult for me. Maybe because I didn’t like anything there—I hated everyone and everything. There was another one who also wanted to run away. One of the three of us who were taken fell sick and she was sent home. I was sad and I used to cry and wished that I too became sick. I fell sick but I was looked after by doctors, the treatment was good. I was kept there and looked after. They gave medicines. I was very unhappy and cried. When we do physical training if you don’t do properly they hit you. I have got hit by some leaders, but some were good. As we go along and if we do well they give more training. I was given a dummy rifle. I had to carry it all the time and look after it like a real one. I was not chosen to be given a real rifle—maybe they knew I was not happy there. Twice they gave me a rifle for my own protection they said. That was when I had to follow a group on a fighting mission. I have never been in the front line or even in the middle—I go only to record the situation. I was given a bag with a pen and a book. There were teams in that group with a leader in charge. The arms given are according to their experience, like T56 and other very sophisticated guns. The magazine rounds, even the cleaning material given out, I had to record. When someone goes out for a hero’s death, they are honored. I feel sorry for them. Many die and never come back. Some have come back after performing dangerous missions. They are then promoted and become respected. I have never shot anybody. I don’t know why that I can’t kill. I made up my mind not to kill anyone. I have had to carry dead bodies. I carry these bodies usually in the dark. Yes I was filled with fear, fear that I can’t talk about. Fear…Fear…Fear…What could I do? I carry the body on my shoulder, it is difficult and I walk crying all the way. I was given a uniform, jeans, shirt and shoes. That was all right. You need comfortable clothes while you are doing all those difficult and terrible jobs. Two women gave me training. I learnt to shoot, but did not shoot anyone, not even an animal. All the time we are trained. We are trained up to the day of the hero’s death. That is also training, that is you go out on a dangerous mission. We get different types of food. Bread, lentils, rice and curry. Different curries are given on different days. We have got even nice apples in the middle of the jungles. When we are on the job, water is brought to us for drinking purposes. Water was difficult to get. Somehow or the other we managed. We used water very carefully. I was not given a cyanide capsule. Only the fighters get cyanide and they have to go through one-year training at least. I did not want to be a fighter and I never got the cyanide. There is a day when you can see the relatives and that day is the hero’s day. On that day my mother’s sister came to see me. I was happy to see her and I was sad also. I cried and cried. My mother came to see me in the camp three times. They do not allow us to see them without any reason. She was sent away and I cried. I found another friend like me who wanted to escape. So two of us used to get together and plan how we could get out of the place. This of course was in my mind from the day I was taken in forcefully. She has been closer to the camp than to where I lived. One day finally we ran away. We walked and walked and finally reached a village. When people asked us we said we were going home on leave. So we escaped. My friend knew how to get to her place, as she was close by. We did not want to go together beyond that. I spent the night with her people and started on my escape. I really didn’t know how to manage. All the while I asked her to escape now I made up my mind to tell the truth to someone and get help. I met an elderly woman, she looked somewhat friendly. I went into her hut. I told her the truth. She took pity on me and agreed to hide me till I could escape. I stayed with her. I never went out during the daytime. This kind lady was good to me. She cared for me. She understood my suffering and really cared for me. I will never forget her—she could have sent me out because her life was in danger—yet she cared for me. I wrote a letter to my mother and one day my mother came and took me. I am very worried about my mother. We have finished all the money. Everything from the bank is over. My mother is sick now; she’s at home. She cannot look after me. I have no one except my mother. She had a big tumor and she was operated. Now she is a sick person and stays at home. She has to go for another operation. The stitches after the operation have come out and she is always in pain. She can’t work, it’s difficult for her now. When the time comes for me to leave this center I have no problem to get back home. Relations are all okay, but not all, some are good, but some don’t like us. My sister and her husband are living a happy life. For my future maybe I can start sewing to earn my living. The few good things I learnt there is how to write and maintain records. This helped me to keep my mind occupied. This helped me to keep away from direct fighting, which I hated. Physical training also helped me somewhat. I got fever and that type of shivering fever still continues and even now I’m suffering from fever. I was in hospital, they said I was better and sent me back but today I feel feverish and shivering comes off and on. I had no romantic involvement, I didn’t have a single boyfriend, and I am not going to have a boyfriend. I will marry someone who is proposed to me. I want to study; I don’t know how to fit in. But I’ll try. Everyone knows that I did not go on my own and I also came back by surrendering. I cannot really understand why this misfortune fell on me. This has changed my life entirely.","Manju was abducted and forced to work for a year as a child soldier in Sri Lanka at the age of 17, one of hundreds of thousands of children who participate in armies and armed groups in more than 30 countries around the world. The problem is most critical in Africa, where up to 100,000 children are estimated to be involved in armed conflict. Child soldiers also exist in Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, though international law sets 18 as the minimum age for all participation in hostilities. In Sri Lanka, children as young as nine were abducted and used in combat by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during its conflict with the Sri Lankan government, between 1983 and 2002. Children—most aged 14 or 15 and over 40 percent girls—were used for massed frontal attacks in major battles, and some between the ages of 12 and 14 were used to massacre women and children in rural villages. Others were used as human mine detectors, assassins and suicide bombers. A ceasefire was implemented in February 2002, this did not halt the LTTE’s use of child soldiers. Children were then more likely to be forcibly recruited: people saw no reason to give their children to the LTTE if they did not perceive themselves to be at risk from the government, and so the LTTE resorted to abduction. In 1994, one in 19 child recruits was abducted. By 2004, only one in 19 was a volunteer."
Marco,1999 (Narrative date),War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was captured three years ago at the beginning of the dry season. I was caught in Marim. I had gone there to visit my aunt. When the Arabs came, I tried to run away. But I was surrounded. About eight men grabbed me. They all wore uniforms. They tied my hands to a long rope. Other people were tied to it too. Then they took us to the train station at the bridge over the River Lol. This station is between Ariath and Wedweil. The soldiers put us in the cars of a train. There were about 28 people in my car. We had to stay inside the car for four days. They only let us out at night for a short time when they gave us food. After we were finished with our food, they put us back inside. It was very hot and dirty in there. The train was then on its way to the North from Wau. When it was ready to leave the station, we were taken out, and had to walk to the North. I was tied up, like before, for the walk. On the way, I had to carry a sack of durrah, and was beaten by the soldiers. It took us eight days before we reached Daein. We were divided up there. The one who organized it was Mohammed Abdullah. He was the leader of the Popular Defense Force. He gave me to Jima Mahmoud. He was one of the soldiers who caught me. Jima Mahmoud took me to his home. He lives in Daein town. Life was very hard with Jima and his wife Howah. They made me grind grain and look after their goats. Every night they tied my hands and legs together and put me in a small outhouse without windows. Jima had another slave. He called him Jima, but his real name is Garang Ngor Bol. He was also tied up and put in the outhouse. We were able to speak Dinka secretly to each other in the outhouse. One day, Garang disappeared. Howah told me was sent to Khartoum. In the evenings, they made me go to the koranic school. I had to memorize the Koran. Teacher Bakhiet would beat me with a whip if I could not memorize well. The khalwa was only for slaves. There were 15 of us, 12 boys and three girls. All of us were teenagers. We were not allowed to speak to each other in Dinka. The teacher said we are now Mujahadeen and would be given guns and money, and would be sent to the South to fight against the Dinka who have no religion. He said the Dinka are not good people, and that he did not want them in the South anymore. I did not like the khalwa. I am a Christian. I used to go to church in Yargot. Sometimes Father Jervis would come and visit us. I was baptized and confirmed by him. I will go to church again when I get back home.  ","Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal (where the narrator was liberated) and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Maria A.,2002 (Narrative date),Trafficking,Italy (slavery location) The Netherlands (slavery location) Albania (trafficked from),France (slavery location),"I’ll call myself Maria in this story. This is a real story about my life and I am not the only one who could be named that name. There are many Marias like I am and that is the reason to bring this story to daylight—to stop ‘Maria’s Story’ from happening again. I come from a little village in Albania where my parents and my sisters still live. They probably think I am dead, and I hope so. It is easier than the truth; I have done things they never can imagine. I shall never see them again. It was only four years ago when a young man from Skopje came into my father’s shop. He was very polite and well dressed and he asked about life in our town. When I said there was little to do, my father asked if he was there to talk or to buy something. My father is very old fashioned and he was always protecting me from boys, which I did not like. I was almost 17 years old and did not need my father’s protection. The smile the young man gave me said he understood. But he talked to my father politely, paid for some items and I saw him going away in a Mercedes Benz car. I was very angry with my father and many times thought of the young man in his expensive car. Perhaps two weeks after, the young man arrived again. This time my father was away in a cafe and we talked (later, I wonder if he watched the shop to see my father going out...). His name was Damir and he spoke of the famous cities he often visited. Rome, Paris, Madrid and many other ones I could only dream about. I said how much I wanted to see them and Damir said that he works for a modeling agency that looks for pretty girls like I was (my face became red but I liked him to say such things...). To live and work in Paris!!! If I wanted to do it, he would arrange for a colleague to speak with my parents. I was very excited and said yes. Some days passed and a woman entered the shop. She was Damir’s colleague. Her jewels and expensive clothes made me embarrassed of my own. She spoke to my parents and showed them a contract. I will earn a certain amount of money, so much to me for living and the rest to my parents. When my father asked about safety, Vanja said that young models live together and always with chaperones. I begged them to allow me and finally my father signed. I remember he was very sad about me going away. Vanja took me to a photo shop for passport photos and said Damir hoped to see me soon. I was in Heaven! The next week Vanja returned. In her car were two other girls, one gypsy girl, younger than me and another Albanian, little older. I kissed my parents goodbye. It was last time I saw them. We drove some hours to Durres on the coast of Adriatic sea. Damir was waiting for us...The other girls knew him also and I was already jealous, but too excited to be angry. He had our new passports but told us he must keep them. It was first time I saw the sea and my first time in a ship. It seemed very big and beautiful. We followed Damir, who had our tickets and travel documents. He spoke with an official and gave him something before we went into the ship and down many stairs. I thought we were near the engine—the smell of oil was very strong, also rotten food and the smell of clothes not washed in a long time. He said for our safety he must lock the door but will return in the morning. Two of us had to share a bed, but only for one night and next day we shall come to Italy! The sound of the engine was very loud and soon the ship was moving very fast. We wished to talk about the handsome men we are going to meet and how the girls at home will be jealous, but the bad smells and moving ship made me and gypsy girl very sick. The next morning we arrived in Bari. Damir took us to a house where the streets are dirty and we saw beggars and even rats during the day. We were nervous because we expecting something very different than that. When we entered the house it smelled as bad as the ship. There were many girls’ magazines, wine bottles and cigarettes on the floor. Some men were sitting inside, they laughed and looked at us in a bad way and spoke to Damir in Italian, which we did not understand. I asked him who they are, but the polite young man from my father’s shop grabbed my arm and said something very bad in Albanian. He hit me on the face. I fell on the ground and he pulled me by my hair into a room and hit me more than once until my face start bleeding. I did not understand what had happened. I heard other girls screaming. And then he raped me. Then the other men came in and did the same. After that event, each day the same men came again, and then others, who paid money to be with us. If we said no, Damir would hit and kick us and give us no food. He said THIS was modeling that we must do for anyone they said. He paid for our passports and documents. They belong to him and to be without them in foreign country means going to prison if the police find us. If we try to escape, he and his friends will kill us and no one will ever know. If we succeed and go to police, bad things will happen to our families and everyone will hear we are prostitutes. He laughed and said we were stupid girls from farms. He asked what our parents and friends would say if they knew with how many men we have had already!? It was very cruel to make us feel ashamed for what he makes us do. One night Damir took me and the gypsy girl to the truck and said another man owns us now and if we thought he is a bad man, this man is worse, so we better do always what he says. He gave our passports to this man and we traveled all night and next day to Marseille in France, where we stayed in a house with the other girls. There I learnt that if I am quiet and do what he says I won’t be punished. Some were given drugs to make them addicts. If they were bad, they did not get the drugs they wanted. I was in Marseille for almost one year and was sold to a man and a woman who took me to Amsterdam. I slept in a small room with no heat and little food, sometimes only what is left over from their meals. Sometimes I did not eat for one or two days. They were drug addicts and would forget about me—except to bring men. When there were no customers, the man would hit me and burn me with cigarettes and force me to do things, sometimes with the woman there also. He said this was to make me remember that he is the master. I made no trouble and after some time the woman take me to carry her shopping. I liked these shopping trips with her and did everything she wanted me to do—it was wonderful to be away from my small, cold room. After some time she began to give me some small money for treats. One day I saw a poster about a charity for women. I begin to pray that I will find them and they will help me. But I was frightened because I had no papers. My owners always said to me how without a passport I will go to prison and then be sent to Albania if the police find me. Even after more than two years I cry with shame of my life and shame for my parents if they ever know about me. One day the woman was looking at clothes. She gave me a small amount of money to buy a treat. But I found a telephone and with the money called the number of the charity. It was difficult to understand me but a Bulgarian came to the telephone and asked where I am. SHE SAID SHE WAS COMING FOR ME!!!!! I worked for this charity for more than one year and helped girls like me. I talked to them every day, and I tell them they must make a new life. They wept very much. I also, but waited until night so they do not see. We all wanted to go home but we cannot. The shame for our parents and us is too large. I dreamed to be a model. Now I dream about a nice man but what man will marry me? Even if he accepts what happen to me I can never have children because of it. It is difficult to smile. My new friends in the charity all say that girls like us must be warned. I came to Bulgaria with the person who saved my life. It is not the Albania I remember and love more than any other place, and where I can never return, but it is in many ways closer to my home than Italy or France or Holland. My friend and I talked about my experiences and those of the girls we helped in Amsterdam and wondered how we could help others before they made the same mistakes. My Bulgarian friend said perhaps the way is Internet. And we decided to make a website. My English is not good but she helps me. We pray that young men and women who are tempted by people who are the lowest animals to smuggle them to the West will find it, and listen to what we suffered. If it saves only one person it will be worth it...We hope many people will find it. Send me your stories of how you traveled from your beloved homeland. What you saw and what happened to you. We should also shame those who tricked, hurt and stole your life from you and your family. These people who think they are above the law—send their names and their crimes.","Born in Albania, ""Maria"" was trafficked into Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Closing the door on slavery seems almost impossible: “The shame for our parents and us is too large…what man will marry me?...It is difficult to smile.” Instead she reopens the door to her slave past and tries to help other trafficking victims—telling them that “they must make a new life” and inviting them to share their stories.
Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania. The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply. "
Maria B.,2005 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Moldova (trafficked from),Ukraine (slavery location),"I was born in Costesti and have only lived here and in Chisinau. My father left when I was young, and my mother died when I was 20. I did not attend school and worked odd-jobs since that time. One year ago I saw a job listing in Makler for nanny and cleaning in Ukraine. The job said it will pay $400 each month. I called the number and took the job. One Ukrainian lady named Olga arranged my job. She made for me a passport and bought me a bus ticket. When I traveled to Ukraine, a man named Stephan met me at the bus station. He took me to the home of a man and woman near the Black Sea. They were maybe 40 years old and had three children. Their home was very big and they forced me to cook and clean from very early in the morning until late at night. They did not give me a break, and when I asked to go back to Moldova, they beat me. They kept my passport and locked me in a small room at night. I slept on a mat on the floor and they only let me eat the food they did not finish. I was very sad those days, but I did their work so the man would not beat me. His name was Victor, and he was very big. Sometimes if he did not like the food I cooked, he removed his belt and beat me with it. If I was bleeding or very ill, he would not call a doctor and made me keep working. In my room at night I cried often and prayed to my mother to send help. One day, after ten months, the family sent me back to Moldova. I asked them for money for my work, but they paid me nothing. I have been in Costesti four months since then and cannot find work. In Moldova there is no work for us, but I will never again take a job from Makler.  ","Born in Moldova, Maria was trafficked into domestic servitude in Ukraine in her late thirties, where her passport was withheld and she was beaten when she tried to leave. She eventually returned to Moldova without pay. Ukraine is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children predominantly subjected to forced labor and to a lesser extent, to sex trafficking. A small number of foreign nationals, including those from Moldova, Russia, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Cameroon, and Azerbaijan, are subjected to forced labor in Ukraine in a variety of sectors including construction, agriculture, manufacturing, domestic work, the lumber industry, nursing, and street begging; experts report the number of foreign victims in Ukraine has fallen dramatically since the beginning of hostilities in eastern Ukraine."
Maria C.,2000 (Narrative date),Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Mexico (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),"My name is Maria. I am in disguise today because I am in fear that my captors would recognize me and thus place my life and that of my family’s in danger. My story begins in May of 1997 in Veracruz, Mexico. I was approached in Mexico by an acquaintance about some jobs in the United States. She told me that there were jobs available in restaurant or bars. I was working as a domestic helper in Mexico and had a job at a general retail store. This seemed like a great opportunity for me to earn more money for my daughter and family. I accepted the job and soon was brought by a coyote to Texas. Once over the border, I was kept at a safe house. Then, I was transported to Florida. Once in Florida, Abel Cadena, one of the ring leaders, told me I would be working at a brothel as a prostitute. I told him he was mistaken and that I was going to be working in a restaurant not a brothel. He then ordered me to work in a brothel. He said I owed him a smuggling debt of approximately $2200 and the sooner I paid it off the sooner I could leave. I was 18 years old and had never been far from home and had no money or way to get home. Next, I was given tight clothes to wear and was told what I must do. There would be armed men selling tickets to customers in the trailer. Tickets were condoms. Each ticket would be sold for $22 to $25 each. The client would then point at the girl he wanted and the girl would take him to one of the bedrooms. At the end of the night, I turned in the condom wrappers. Each wrapper represented a supposed deduction to my smuggling fee. We tried to keep our own records, but the Bosses would destroy them. We were never sure what we owed. There were up to four girls kept at each brothel. We were constantly guarded and abused. If anyone refused to be with a customer, we were beaten. If we adamantly refused, the Bosses would show us a lesson by raping us brutally. They told us if we refused, again it would be even worse the next time. We were transported every 15 days to another trailer in a nearby city. This was to give the customers a variety of girls and so we never knew where we were in case we tried to escape. I could not believe this was happening to me. We worked six days a week and 12-hour days. We mostly had to serve 32-35 clients a day. Weekends were worse. Our bodies were utterly sore and swollen. The bosses did not care. We worked no matter what. This included during menstruation. Clients would become enraged if they found out. The Bosses instructed us to place a piece of clothing over the lamps to darken the room. This, however, did not protect us from client beatings. Also, at the end of the night our work did not end. It was now the Bosses’ turn with us. If anyone became pregnant we were forced to have abortions. The cost of the abortion would then be added to our smuggling debt. The Bosses carried weapons. They scared me. The brothels were often in isolated areas. I never knew where I was. It was all so strange to me. We were not allowed to go outside of the brothels. I knew if I tried to escape I would not get far because everything was so unfamiliar. The Bosses told me that if I escaped, INS would catch me, beat me and tie me up. This frightened me. I did know of one girl who escaped. The Bosses searched for her and said they were going to get the money she owed them from their family. They said they would get their money one way or another. I know of another girl that escaped and was hunted down. The Bosses found her and beat her severely. The Bosses would show the girl that they meant business by beating and raping her brutally. All I could do is stand there and watch. I was too afraid to try to escape. I also did not want my family put in danger. I was enslaved for several months, other women were enslaved for up to a year. Our enslavement finally ended when the INS, FBI, and local law enforcement raided the brothels and rescued us. We weren’t sure what was happening on the day of the raids. Our captors had told us over and over never to tell the police of our conditions. They told us that if we told we would find ourselves in prison for the rest of our lives. They told us that the INS would rape us and kill us. But we learned to trust the INS and FBI and assisted them in the prosecution of our enslavers. Unfortunately, this was difficult. After the INS and FBI freed us from the brothels we were put in a detention center for many months. Our captors were correct. We thought we would be imprisoned for the rest of our lives. Later, our attorneys were able to get us released to a women’s domestic violence center where we received comprehensive medical attention, including gynecological exams, and mental health counseling. Thanks to the United States government some of our captors were brought to justice and were sent to prison. Unfortunately, not all. Some of them are living in Mexico in our hometown of Veracruz. They have threatened some of our families. They have even threatened to bring our younger sisters to the United States and force them to work in brothels as well. I would never ever have done this work. No one I know would have done this work. I am speaking out today because I never want this to happen to anyone else. However, in order to accomplish this goal women like me need your help. We need the law to protect us from this horror. We need the immigration law to provide victims of this horror with permanent legal residence. We came to the United States to find a better future, not to be prostitutes. If anyone thinks that providing protection to trafficking survivors by affording them permanent residency status is a magnet for other immigrants like myself; they are wrong. No woman or child would want to be a sex slave and endure the evil that I have gone through. I am in fear for my life more than ever. I helped put these evil men in jail. Please help me. Please help us. Please do not let this happen to anyone else. Thank you.","In 1997, at the age of 18, Maria was trafficked from Mexico into sex slavery in the US. She was transported into Texas, then to a trailer in Florida. Up to four young women worked in the same trailer, each of them having sex with up to 35 men a day, for 12 hours a day. They were constantly guarded, and beaten and raped by their bosses. After Maria had been enslaved for several months, FBI agents, along with agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and local law offices, raided the brothel. Some of her captors were tried, others escaped and returned to Mexico. Maria now observes that she is “in fear for my life more than ever.”
The US Department of Justice estimates that of the 14,500 and 17,500 foreign-born individuals trafficked into the US annually, some 80 percent are female, and 70 percent of these women end up as sex slaves. Feeder countries include Albania, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico (many from the central region of Tlaxcala, a haven for modern-day slave traders), Nigeria, and Ukraine. Often the women are forced to work to pay off the debts imposed by their smugglers—debts ranging from $40,000 to $60,000 per person. They might perform 4000 acts of sexual intercourse each year to meet their quota, at $10 to $25 per act."
Mariana,2003 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Ukraine (trafficked from),Germany (slavery location),"I was born in 1981 in Poltava region, Ukraine. I had never known who my father was. My grandmother told that he had worked at the collective farm and had died there during the fire. My mother died when I was three years old and my grandmother brought me up. I studied at school and worked hard at the collective farm and at home. In 1997 I finished the ninth form. I couldn’t continue studying, because I had to go to the region centre. Once in summer my friends and I went dancing. There were a lot of young people and some boys from Kyiv among them. The boy from my school came up to me and said that one of the Kyivites wanted to speak to me. His name was Rostik. He proposed me to work in Germany as a nurse. When my friend Nadja learned about this work she also was very interested in it. We decided to go together but Rostik didn’t come to our village for a long time. My grandmother got very little pension and I worked at the collective farm. I was waiting for Rostik. He came to the village only before Christmas and proposed me to go to Germany at once. He persuaded my friend and me that everything will be good. But Nadja’s parents didn’t allow her to go. I also started to hesitate but he persuaded me. Rostik promised that one woman who also wanted to work in Germany would go with me. I considered him to be a reliable and thoughtful person. So I agreed to go and promised to my grandmother to be back in a month. Rostik asked me whether I had a foreign passport. But I hadn’t even Ukrainian passport. Then he said that would set the affair by himself. We went by car. There was a woman in the car, but she disappeared somewhere during the trip. I didn’t notice that we crossed Poland border. In Poland we stopped for a night in the house of one of Rostik’s friends. His name was Stefan. He helped us to cross a river at night and we got to Germany. We continued our trip by car. Guys brought me to some house and told me that the owner was waiting for me inside and that I had to set the affair by myself. I left all my things in the car and came in. The owner was a middle-aged man. He told me some words in bad Russian and pushed me in a room and locked me there. I couldn’t understand what had happened with me. I’d sat there for a long time and didn’t know what to do. Then a nice woman came to me and brought me some food. She asked about my parents and my birthplace. The woman was Polish and I understood her quite well. She asked me whether I knew I had to work as prostitute. I began to cry. Two weeks passed. I was crying all the time. I wasn’t allowed to go out and I was scared. The same women brought me food. Once the women asked me how old I was. She didn’t believe that I was 16. Next morning she came to me again and said she was very sorry for me. She gave me some money and explained how to escape. She asked me not to tell anybody that she had helped me. The woman said that the owner paid big money for me. So I’ve gone to Holland. The police helped me to make contact with an NGO which helps those women who were sold. They helped me to come back to Ukraine. Now my grandmother has died. I can’t live in my village because the pimps are looking for me. They are very angry that I escaped. They said to my neighbors that I was a prostitute in Germany. I don’t have any place to live. Two months I have lived with my uncle, another two months with my friend. I would like to enter a hairdresser school but it cost money. I don’t have any.","Mariana was trafficked into Germany from Ukraine in 1997 at the age of 16. She had accepted the offer of a job: the push for women to leave Ukraine and other old Soviet areas is powerful. They account for up to 90 percent of the unemployed and are usually the first fired. Traffickers abduct an estimated 35,000 women from Ukraine each year. Almost 50 countries serve as destination points throughout Europe and eastward. Germany is one of the most popular destinations in Europe for women trafficked from Ukraine and Russia, though victims also come from Africa (mainly Nigeria) and Asia (mainly Thailand). In the aftermath of her enslavement, Mariana still felt trapped. She couldn’t return to her Ukrainian village because her neighbors believed she had been a “prostitute in Germany,” and pimps were looking for her. She moved to her uncle’s house, then to a friend’s house, seemingly on a perpetual journey from slavery to freedom."
Mary,1999 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I used to live in Aweil town. I was married to Michael Nyong Akol. He was a student there. I am a Christian. My husband and father were Christians too. I used to go to Church in Aweil. The priest there was Father Matong. I was very happy when I was at church. We fled Aweil some years ago when there was insecurity in the town. We went to Marin village and survived by farming. In Marin, I had three children. Their names are Nyibol, Akon and Abol. I was five months pregnant when the soldiers came and caught me. It happened when the train came to Wedweil last summer. I tried to run away, but they threatened to shoot me dead. I obeyed and stopped running. Five soldiers grabbed me. I did not struggle with them. They then tried to tie me to a rope. I refused to cooperate, so they threw me down on the ground and beat me. I almost had a miscarriage. I knew because I started to bleed from the womb. After the beating, I could not walk, and was put on a horse. They took me to their camp near Wedweil, and put me in a big pen with a lot of other people. I spent two days in the pen. Then, everyone had to start walking to the North, together with the cattle. I was still not able to walk, so they again put me on one of the horses. It took us many days to get to Matarik. We were all divided up there. I was given to Mahmoud Abdullah. He called me Zeneib, and took me to his home. It was nearby in Matarik. He is a trader there. In his shop, he sells sugar, grain, soap and things like that. I had to clean his house, wash clothes, cook and fetch water with the donkey. Mahmoud had four boy slaves to look after his cattle. Their names are Yel Ngor Akol, Aciek Kuol Tong, Dut Angok Angok and Macol Chan Atak. Mahmoud has two Arab wives. They are Asha and Kadija. They were kind to me. They gave me clothes to wear. But Mahmoud was very unkind. Whenever he was unhappy with me, he would beat me. Once he wanted me to go to the Koranic school and cook for the boys there, but I refused to do it because I am a Christian. He did not force me to go there. One day the trader Ibrahim came and took me and my baby to the forest and then brought us back here. I am very happy to be back here. I thank everyone who helped me come back. I am sure I will be even happier when I find my husband and children. I will now return to my village and look for them. ","Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal (where the narrator was liberated) and the Nuba Mountains. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle. One study documents 12,000 abductions by name, while NGOs offer estimates ranging from 15,000 to 200,000. The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."
Masha (Narrative 1),2006 (Narrative date) ,Debt bondage Sexual exploitation,Russia (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Germany (slavery location),"My name is Masha. I am 33 years old. By education I’m a lawyer in the field of social services. I previously worked as an inspector in the social security services department and as a human resource manager in a medical college. In 1996, I visited my relatives in St. Petersburg. While standing in a line at the railway station to buy a ticket home, I met a middle-aged woman who seemed very nice. During our conversation she mentioned that she has good friends in Germany who are looking for a young Russian girl to assist them with housekeeping. She offered me a chance to go to Germany to see the country and learn the language as well as to earn some money. At the time, I had not been to a foreign country and was unemployed. The opportunity seemed interesting and I agreed. This woman helped me fill out the necessary paper work and in the beginning of 1997 I left for Germany on a bus. In Hamburg, I was met by a young Russian woman named Janna. She brought me to her home and immediately took my passport away, acting as though she wanted to show it to the people I was supposed to work for. The next day, she met three more Russian girls at the bus station and brought them to her home as well. Their passports were also taken away. Later that day, Janna informed me that the job I had been promised did not exist. However, she said that there was no need for me to go home as she would provide me with another job. Janna took all of us by car to a bar called “Sixty Four” where prostitutes worked. Janna told us that we would work as prostitutes and that there was no sense in resisting or complaining—in fact, it would be dangerous to do so. She threatened that if anyone tried to escape to the police she would be severely beaten since they have their own people in the police and runaways would be returned regardless and punished. I decided not to behave aggressively and pretended to be completely compliant; I even tried to demonstrate frustration when clients did not select me. Janna believed my act and began looking for an appropriate bar for me. This is how I came to work in several German bars. One day, Janna brought me and three other girls to a bar in a small city on the highway Hamburg-Hanover. I don’t remember the name of the city, but it was close to Bielefeld. The bar’s name was “Savoy” and it was closed. Two day later, we found out that the reason the bar was closed was that several Russian girls had recently been murdered there. Now that the situation with the police had been cleared up and the club re-opened, we were brought in to replace the murdered girls. There we found the clothes, underwear and purses of the murdered girls. At the bar’s grand opening, we worked as hostesses and prostitutes. We were not allowed to leave this place and had no documents. Fortunately, approximately a week later the bar was raided and we were taken to the police department in Bielefeld. At the police department, a Russian female lawyer questioned us. She pitied us and we were released into the streets. We did not have anywhere to go. No one told us about any shelters or services. We were lost and afraid in a strange country. We didn’t know the language and had no money, so we went back to the bar. We had hoped that we could get our things, call for help and arrange our escape but there was someone at the bar waiting for us who called Janna. That evening, Janna came to take me back to Hamburg. There she sold me to another pimp for $1000 and again I was put to work in one of the German bars as a prostitute. In a week this bar was also raided by the police and I was again detained at the police department. Later, I was released and was supposed to pick up my documents at another place. I did not know German or the city but kind local people helped me get there. When I finally got there, they did not have a translator but my documents were ready for my deportation from Germany. I wanted to explain what had happened and that I shouldn’t be deported, but nobody wanted to listen or talk to me and I ran away. Usually when a girl’s visa expires or when she is detained by the police, the traffickers provide her with a false passport (at that time for me it was a Polish one) and they immediately traffic her to the Netherlands. Most of the criminal groups have clubs in both Germany and the Netherlands, where they also sell drugs. The other girls from the German night club were given false passports and trafficked to Holland, but I could not tolerate it anymore. I stopped eating and told my pimp that I would jump from the fourth floor. He believed me and was afraid that I would draw more attention from the police; I don’t know exactly why, but this man helped me buy a ticket home and come back to Russia. Thus, in two months I was back home. But even two years later, I was depressed and had many troubles. Then I found an ad in a newspaper for the St. Petersburg Crisis Center for Women, which provides psychological assistance to the victims of human trafficking. I contacted them and they invited me to come in. This is how I came across the Angel Coalition. From them, I received psychological, moral and material assistance. I went back to my town and started an NGO which is a member of the Angel Coalition. It seems like we Russian women are placed in impossible economic conditions and are not needed by our own country. In other countries, we are spit on as prostitutes when we are really victims. Ten years have passed since I was trafficked, but the situation has still not changed. Is the German government really not aware of what is happening in their country? Or are they happy to profit from our suffering?","Masha was trafficked into Germany from Russia, where traffickers abduct an estimated 55,000 women each year. Corrupt police officers and border guards reportedly accept bribes to facilitate trafficking. She was kept prisoner and her passport was withheld from her to prevent her from escaping, but was later arrested in a police raid, which gave her the opportunity to return to Russia. Masha recalls that the German police did not try to understand her situation but simply treated her as a criminal. Another narrative from Masha is available in the archive."
Masha (Narrative 2),2000 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Debt bondage,Russia (trafficked from) Debt bondage,Germany (slavery location),"My name is Masha, and I am from Southern Russia. In 1996, when I was twenty-four, I visited St. Petersburg. I was preparing to return home to my village, waiting at the train station one day, when a woman approached me. She started talking with me about life problems, encouraging me to share mine with her. We had a nice talk, and the woman suggested that she could help me to get work somewhere abroad. She told me she had an acquaintance in Germany, a woman who could connect me with a family for whom I could be a housemaid. I was issued a tourist visa to Spain and left on a bus tour of Europe in February 1997. I was supposed to get off the bus in Germany. There I was met by a woman named Geanna, who had a flat in Hamburg. She took me to an apartment there, where I met about 20 other girls who had come from Russia and Poland. Most of them were younger than me. After a few days, Geanna told me she could not find a family who would hire me as a housemaid. She said I owed her 2,000 German marks (about $1,000 USD) and said that I would earn that money by providing sexual services to men. I was shocked. I was afraid to say no because she had taken my passport, and I didn't know any German. She and her husband, who was a drug dealer, threatened to beat me if I tried to leave, and said if I went to the police, I would be deported. They said no one would care what happened to me and no one would help. Girls who would not cooperate were taken down to the basement of the bar, where they were beaten across their backs, where it would not show but would still be painful, possibly causing damage to their kidneys. I was afraid they would use drugs and alcohol to force me to prostitute myself – I had seen other girls given cocaine and beaten into submission. Geanna tried to tell me that it didn't happen, but her husband threatened that I would suffer the same if I did not go along with it. Downstairs from our apartment, there was a bar where we were to find clients for sex. I tried not to attract attention by dressing modestly and sitting by myself. The girls who had come to Germany knowing they would be prostitutes were regularly beaten. Our passports were kept behind the bar, but we were afraid to take them because big guards supervised us all the time. The place had surveillance cameras on the bar and on the road so they could see clients or police coming. I was kept there for two months, and never made much profit. I had only a tourist visa, good for one month, but Geanna told me she could prepare documents that would say I was married to a German man. She would do this so I would have to stay longer and work for her. I refused; so instead, she sold me to a Greek pimp who was operating in Germany. Shortly after that, the police raided the bar and I was taken, along with the other girls, to the station. I was not given a chance to explain what had happened to me – that I never wanted to be there, that I was tricked, threatened and intimidated into staying. Instead, I was charged with prostitution and held in a jail cell. I was issued an order to leave Germany, or face deportation. The Greek pimp then gave me money for a ticket back to Russia. Some would say that he took pity on me, but in reality this helped him to avoid being arrested and charged with pimping. He was never charged, and the German police never attempted to do anything about the network of people who had trafficked me – from the woman who recruited me, to the agent who got me the visa, to the Russian woman pimp and her husband.","Masha was trafficked to Germany from Russia and enslaved in sex work when she was 24 years old. She was kept prisoner and her passport was withheld from her to prevent her from escaping, but was later arrested in a police raid, which gave her the opportunity to return to Russia. Masha recalls that the German police did not try to understand her situation but simply treated her as a criminal. Another narrative from Masha is available in the archive."
Milena,2005 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Moldova (trafficked from),Russia (slavery location),"I grew up with my mother in the village of Costesti. I never knew my father. In 2003 Roma gypsies came to our village. A woman and daughter moved into a small house near mine. I was 17 at that time. I became friends with the gypsy girl, Dolina. My mother worked as a waitress in Chisinau, but I did not have a job, and I was not in school at that time. One day Dolina asked me if I wanted to go for work abroad as a nanny. She told me we could make $400 or $500 each month, and the work was not very difficult. I told her I would think about it. I did not tell my mother because I thought: “If I go, I can make more money than my mother and come back and surprise her.” Also, I thought my mother would not let me go abroad. A few days later, I decided to go. The next morning when my mother left for work, I dressed up nice and left a note telling my mother I was going for work and would be back in a few weeks. Dolina took me to Chisinau on a bus and we stayed with her relatives there for a few days. They treated me very nice. Then Dolina, me, and a two gypsy men went in a car to Moscow. They spoke their language, so I could not understand what they were saying. At the border, they showed the guards documents and we passed through. In Moscow, we went to an apartment building. Inside the apartment, there was one sofa, one table, and calendars of naked girls on the walls. The calendars were not written in Russian or Moldovan. I asked Dolina: “Will I baby-sit here?” She told me: “Yes, in this place.” “Where is the little girl,” I asked, “Where is the mother?” “They are visiting the neighbors,” Dolina told me, “There will be here in a minute.” At that time the men were looking at many documents. They told me: “A man will come soon. Do not be afraid if you see many men.” I was alone in the apartment for a few hours and became afraid. Soon two Russian men came. They were friendly with me and asked me questions. They asked me how old I was and if I had had sex with men before. I asked them why they needed to know this, and they laughed. Then three other Russian men came with vodka and food. They put plastic on the sofa and we ate from it. I was very hungry, and I ate one sausage and bread. They made me get drunk, even though I had never had alcohol before. The room went spinning around me and I was very dizzy. The men laughed. One of the men touched my legs and breasts. I objected, but he hit me and said: “You will do what I say!” They told me to undress. I refused, but they punched my ribs and undressed me. All five men raped me again and again. Two of the men forced themselves inside me at once, and I bled very badly. They said they were teaching me to be a prostitute. I cried, but they did not stop. When they finally left, the room was messy with empty bottles and smoke in the air. I felt very ill and wanted to go home. In the morning, another man came and raped me. He told me, whoever comes I must have sex with them. I asked him where was Dolina. He said he did not know. He left me food and told me to shower. That day five men raped me. Each day a man gave me breakfast and dinner. Sometimes he brought me new clothes to wear. Everyday I was alone, except when the men came to rape me. Eight, ten, sometimes 15 men in a day. I do not know how long I was in that apartment. There was one small window, which was always locked. I could see from it that I came in the spring and left in winter. One day, Dolina and the same two men who first brought me to Moscow came to the apartment. I could not believe it. I asked Dolina: “Why did you do this to me? Don’t you know these men sold me and raped me?” “I did not do this to you,” Dolina told me, “When we came I was told they only needed one girl for nanny and you would be sent back.” Dolina and the gypsy men drove me back to Moldova. We stayed in Chisinau for a few days with her relatives. This time they made me live separately. I ate alone, slept on the floor, and they made me wash myself separately. Dolina asked me: “Would you like to go home?” I said, “Yes.” She told me my mother had alerted the police I was missing, and she made me promise that I must say I was working with a friend in Chisinau this entire time. Dolina took me home, but my mother was at work. I climbed in through the window, and when my mother returned, she could not believe I was back. She asked me where I had been for so long. I tried to lie, but I could not. I told her the truth. We went straight to the police and told them everything, but they said the gypsies had moved from Costesti long before. No one ever found Dolina or the other gypsy men.  ","Milena was born in Moldova and trafficked into sex slavery in Russia, where men and women are also trafficked in from Central Asia and North Korea for forced labor and sexual exploitation. Moldova is a country origin for the trafficking of women and children into European sex slavery. Its economic conditions fuel this trafficking. In 2000, the country’s GDP was 40 percent of its level in 1990. Unemployment remains high, especially among women. People are forced to look outside of the country for work and pimps take advantage: some victims are kidnapped but more often they answer job advertisements promising work and then are forced into sex slavery. Most Moldovan trafficking victims are taken to the Balkan countries, though other destinations include Asia, Turkey, Western Europe and the Middle East."
Miranda,"  International Organization for Migration, with the Association of Albanian Girls and Women, 2005 (Narrative date)",Belgium (slavery location) Albania (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,Albania (trafficked from),"International Organization for Migration, with the Association of Albanian Girls and Women","I was born in Korce in Albania in 1984. I lived with my family in the outskirts of Korce. Last summer when I was walking to a friend’s house a car drew by and two men offered to drive me to my friend’s house. One of the men was a cousin of my brother’s friend. Instead of driving me to my friend’s place, they took me to a house in Vlore, where a few other girls were staying. They told me that my brother wanted me to go to Italy, where I could work for an Albanian family and earn money to support my family. They also threatened me that bad things could happen to my family if I would resist them or try to run away. I lived for two weeks in this house. I stayed with two other girls in a small room and we were not allowed to go out. One girl came from Moldova and the other girl came from Berat. One evening we were taken from the house and brought to the seashore. There we waited for two hours before embarking on a boat. We were accompanied by one of the men who took me to Vlore. There was also another man whom I had never seen before. There were about 40 people on this small boat. We were not allowed to speak to the other passengers but I heard that we were heading for Italy. I was scared as it was night and the boat traveled at a very high speed. We arrived the same night in Italy and had to jump out into the water about 30 meters from the coastline. There were cars waiting to pick up some of the passengers. We were taken to a house where we stayed overnight. The next day two other men took us to the train station and we left for Milan. There was a car waiting for us and we were taken to a house where we stayed for two days. We then took the train to Paris. The men who had transferred us to Italy didn’t go with us. Only me and the girl from Moldova took off to Paris. The other girl from Albania remained in Milan. Two Albanians who accompanied us told us that if we would be controlled on the train we had to pretend to be their sisters. There was no control on that train. In Paris we took a train to Brussels where we were picked up by another man. He spoke Albanian, but I don’t think he was from my country. They drove us to a house in Antwerp. The same night one of the men told us that we had to work in prostitution. I told him that I didn’t want to work in prostitution, but he threatened me severely. That very night I was forced by another man to have sexual intercourse. He told me that this would be a preparation for my new job. I cried and said that my brother would never agree to this. They told me that my brother was in Albania and wouldn’t be much of a help. I worked for one month in a window. I had several clients a day and was forced to hand over all the money they paid me. I was heavily guarded by those people and beaten up on several occasions. They often threatened to kill me or harm my family if I wouldn’t comply. I was afraid of them as I knew they carried guns and were on drugs. One night police came in the window and took me to the police station. I stayed for several hours at the police station and told my story. They referred me to the Payoke shelter where I have been staying for three weeks now. They helped me to contact my family. My father told me that my brother had been receiving threats by this gang in Korce. I want to return as quickly as possible to my family in Albania. My father is planning to move to another place as it might be dangerous for us in Korce. The social workers from Payoke are assisting me and are currently arranging my return to Albania. They also contacted an organization in Albania to assist me upon my return home.  ","The fall of communism in 1991 led to a rise in organized crime in Albania: in 2001 it was estimated 100,000 Albanian women and girls had been trafficked to Western European and other Balkan countries in the preceding ten years. More than 65 percent of Albanian sex-trafficking victims are minors at the time they are trafficked, and at least 50 percent of victims leave home under the false impression that they will be married or engaged to an Albanian or foreigner and live abroad. Another ten percent are kidnapped or forced into prostitution. The women and girls receive little or no pay for their work, and are commonly tortured if they do not comply.Born in Albania, Miranda was trafficked into Belgium, where by some estimates Albanian girls aged 14 and 15 make up nearly half of the foreign women forced into prostitution. Many women are trafficked into richer Western European countries from the poorer Eastern countries, including Albania."
Ngor,1999 (Narrative date) ,War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from),Sudan (slavery location),"I was captured in 1996. Soldiers came to my village. Many people were killed in the attack, including my mother. She was shot dead. I ended up at the home of an Arab man called Mohammed. One day in the summer, about two years ago, my master's wife threw a pot of boiling water in my face. She did this because I was too weak to look after Mohammed's cattle. I received very little food in my master's home. My left eye gives me pain. I can't close it properly. I can hardly see with it any more. Other slaves in Mohammed's house were treated just the same. As told to Christian Solidarity International staff in Aweil State, Southern Sudan.","Along with the three main types of modern slavery (chattel slavery, debt bondage, and contract slavery), war slavery is another form of contemporary bondage. Thousands of women and children were taken into slavery during the decades of Sudan’s civil war, mainly from Northern Bahr El Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains. Ngor was ‘redeemed’ (bought out of slavery) by Christian Solidarity International (CSI), a Zurich-based international human rights organization, in 1999. Slave-taking was revived in 1985 by the National Islamic government of Sudan primarily as a weapon against counterinsurgents in the South, and secondarily a way to reimburse its surrogate soldiers for neutralizing this threat. In 1989 the government created the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), militia trained to raid villages and take people as slaves. PDF recruits were allowed to keep whoever they captured, along with booty of grain and cattle.

The slaves were often moved to large towns in the north on week-long journeys during which the women were repeatedly raped, and then sold to new masters who used them without pay for farming and sexual services. The peace process brought these PDF abductions to an end, but inter-tribal abductions continue in Southern Sudan. In addition, Sudanese children are used by rebel groups in the ongoing conflict in Darfur; Sudanese boys from the country’s eastern Rashaida tribe continue to be trafficked to the Middle East for use as camel jockeys; the rebel organization “Lord’s Resistance Army” has forcibly conscripted children in Southern Sudan for use as combatants in its war against Uganda; and the institution of chattel slavery continues in southern Darfur and southern Kordofan."

A day later, a police officer and consulate staff met me and my husband, who had been asked to come in and bring along my passport, to find a solution to the family matter. The police officer asked whether I wanted to return to my husband.  I replied no. he sent me to a shelter again and the consulate asked me to stay there and wait for the required documents to be processed. I stayed in the shelter for about two weeks until the consulate officer informed me that the documents were done and I had to buy my ticket home. I told him that I didn’t have money to pay for that. He suggested that I call home and ask my parent to arrange the transfer. My mom managed to get $300 transferred to the officer through his relative in Phnom Penh and finally I flew back home to Cambodia.   Narrative provided by UN-ACT report Human Trafficking Vulnerabilities in Asia  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day in 2016 there were over 3.8 million people living in conditions of modern slavery in China. Women and girls from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa are trafficked in to forced marriage in the country for fees of up to £30,000. The gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides.

Rokeya,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bangladesh (trafficked from),Kuwait (slavery location),"I was 29 years old when my husband sent me abroad to improve our economic situation. My own family disapproved and I was not keen either. I just obeyed my husband. My husband contacted Shaju (Josna's son-in-law). I was sent with a company visa. Because the salary is low, Josna promised me to help find another job. She said I could earn about 50 KD a month in this way. The cost was 75,000 taka. I left one month after giving the money. My two children stayed with my mother-in-law. Josna came to get me at the airport in Kuwait. I was at her place for two days, and then she took me to the Al Nocif Company. We lived in a brek (residence). There were 20 girls in my room, 15 Bangladeshis and 5 Sri Lankans. Our duty was from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. We received only 20 KD per month and we had to feed ourselves. It was not possible to send money home, so girls were forced to take up another work. I was also forced to do it. My husband had warned me: ""I spent all my capital on you, so don't waste it. No matter what the work is, no matter how difficult, you must stick it out and recoup this money."" I always remembered these words. This is why I was forced to do it. No one who works for a company can pretend to send money home without doing this work. After official duty, women lined up outside the brek and were picked up by customers. They were taken to clubs, mess, and hotels, inside shops, even in cars. Sometimes they were taken to brothels. Those who worked through drivers, shopkeepers, and other intermediaries did not make much money. If you can contact clients directly, it is more profitable as you get the money straight into your hand. At first, I did this work through a Bangladeshi shopkeeper (actually his main business is collecting women, his shop is just a front). He was a Comilla man, about 38 years old. His name was Salam. Other girls from my brek introduced me to him. I worked through Salam for about 6 months and once I understood what it was about, then I contacted clients myself. Salam tried to stop me. He threatened me and I had to work out of his sight. What is the use to show shame? What I did abroad I told you. If I had not done this work, I could never have sent money home. And if I had not sent money home, my life would have been hell upon return. Those who took us were Saudis, Pakistanis, and Kuwaitis. Very few were Bangladeshis. Bangladeshi men did not pay us much and because of this we did not like going with them. Through the shopkeeper, I could earn 4-5 KD per day but, alone, I earned 10-12 KD per day. If I went to a hotel or to a club, I got more. If I spent a night at a private home, I earned 7- 8 KD. Every day I could earn something and free food came as a bonus. I went with different men every time. We were always busy and short of time. We had to be very well organized. When going through a dalal, we had to do more men and we had less money and less freedom. Some days, I could take rest if I wished. I did not mind. Contraceptives were not the customer's headache. That was ours. Pills, condoms, injections were available. I used pills. (Rokeya shows no awareness about the risks of contracting AIDS) The first six months, I did not get much money because I did not understand. The lowest amount I sent home was 10,000 taka; the highest was 25,000 taka per month. One day, I got very frightened. I met some people I knew from our area. I thought, if my husband learns what I do, he may divorce me. I also thought about the sins that I was committing, so I decided very quickly to go back to Bangladesh. Seven days after taking that decision, I was back home. Our situation has improved. My husband is happy. He has money in his hand. Relatives are happy. I kept 20,000 taka for myself, my husband does not know this. I would not have spoken so much. I told you my story so that you may know what uneducated women do abroad and how selfish husbands are. What kind of work they get their wives to do. If they get the money, there is no problem. If I had failed to send money, for sure, my conjugal life would have been difficult. I don't feel much attracted to my husband any more. I am angry that he sent me abroad but I hide these feelings from him. No one but myself knows what I did over there. Now, I say my prayers everyday and ask for Allah's forgiveness.""     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub  "," There are an estimated 6000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Kuwait (GSI 2018).

She took me to her house where I found other Bangladeshi women. They were from Comilla, Munshigonj and Joydebpur. Seven days later, Josna took me to an employer.

""One day, one of the sons tried to rape me. I found shelter in the room of the Sri Lankan maid. She told me if I did not want to provide this service, I should go back to Bangladesh.

She said: -   ""What small thing has happened, let it be. You make a lot of it. What can I do? You came abroad; you have to accept storms and rain. If you don't bake the clay, it does not get hard. Now, you decide what you want to do."" I said, ""Send me back to Bangladesh. What I have suffered, I have suffered. I don't want to live this anymore.”  She said: ""Do you have any money to buy the ticket?"" I replied: ""All my employers said you have received my salary. Can you not buy the ticket?""  - ""I can do one thing. I can leave you at the agency."" I spent 2 months at the agency. The agency people used me in all kinds of way. What could I do? I had no money to go back to Bangladesh. After this, I decided to go to a fourth employer and accept everything.  Josna sells women and makes a lot of money out of it. She usually picks girls who are weak and have no family to look after them and she sells them in different places. She is very powerful in Kuwait. You cannot escape her. She also makes money from girls she keeps in her home. In 1992, she took Korimon from our village. She had a company visa. She kept her at her house a long time and used her. Korimon left very angry. She is lost now. She has not given news for 4 years. Her mother wants to know if she is alive.

Afrin Akhtar,2002 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Bangladesh (trafficked from),Kuwait (slavery location),"I was left 10 days at the airport without washing, without eating or sleeping properly. No one came to pick me up. I was terrified. After 10 days, Josna came with a Bangladeshi man. They took me to an office. There were many girls there from Bangladesh and from other countries. They were all young like me and beautiful. We were well fed. Bangladeshi men came and talked to us. After 15 days, I was sent to work in a house. There were 6 Bangladeshi men from different districts in that house. They did not tell me anything about salary. When someone came, they presented me as the wife of one of them. I could not protest. They said the law is very strict and this was the only way I could stay. They said, give us your bank account number and we will send money directly to your family. After 1 month, they showed me a letter supposedly from my husband. It said he had received 8,000 taka but I later found out it was not true. I had to work day and night. I had bought my misery from Josna and she had sold me to them. After 1 month, I ran away and the police picked me up. I stayed 25 days in jail. Josna freed me. I don't know how she did this. I was taken back to the agency. I was there for one week and taken to another employer for 3 months. There again, I got no salary. Because of this, I quarreled with the lady and went back to the agency. For one year, I was sent to different homes and worked on a daily basis. The agency took all my money. The employer paid for me but I received nothing. The agency people kept saying they would pay me after 3 months, after 6 months. I could not send any money home. I felt really depressed. I told Josna one day: ""You are using me, making money out of me. You have done nothing for me."" Josna replied: ""Fine, I will send you back to Bangladesh. I said: ""No. I spent a lot of money to come here, my relationship with my husband is not good, my father has given me my share of the inheritance, I cannot go back."" Josna sent me to work in the house of a police officer. He had two wives, one Saudi and one Irani. At this point, I accepted everything the master asked for. I was so afraid of experiencing again a situation like what I had known the first 1 year.   Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub  "," There are an estimated 6000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Kuwait (GSI 2018).

Anura,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bangladesh (trafficked from),Kuwait (slavery location),"On 7 April 2001, two of us left together for Kuwait. We bought company visas from Josna who came to visit Bangladesh. The cost was 75,000 taka each. One Comilla driver, partner of Josna, picked us up at the airport and took us to Sabaya. There were 7 girls living there. Some had been there for 3 months, others for 6 months, all had been there for less than one year. Two girls were from Teknaf, 2 from Narayangonj, 1 was from Gazipur, 1 from Tangail and 1 from Dinajpur. We were not allowed to mix with them. They used to come back from duty tired early in the morning and leave again after lunch well dressed and well made up. The driver took them to their work place and brought them back. Two of them looked very depressed and sad, the others looked happy. The driver had a mobile. He spoke often to Josna (who was in Bangladesh at the time). They spoke in Arabic. We could not understand their conversation. We were at Josna for 5 days. The driver promised us a salary of 40 KD plus food and cosmetics. Then he took us to Abassya. He did not explain what kind of work we would have to do but he said we could not wait until Josna returned to start. We were taken to a room and asked to put on a dress we could not possibly wear. We were told we would have to please two foreign men. The driver tried to frighten us. He threatened us. We refused to wear the clothes and he hit us. He took us back at Josna's house and locked us up for 24 hours without food, water and fan. Then, he asked us whether we had understood. We agreed to work but between us we had decided to run away. He took us to a Bangladeshi woman who runs a brothel. We were there for 3 days. We did not show our disagreement, then, we ran away through the bathroom. They could not break us; we were strong because we were two together. It took us another 15 days to return to Bangladesh. One man took us to the Bangladesh Embassy and the Embassy suggested we give ourselves up to the police. If we had agreed to do as the driver asked us, we would have earned good money but we could not do it.  Why is no one putting Josna in jail? How can she do this to people.     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub    "," There are an estimated 6000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Kuwait (GSI 2018).

I kept nothing for myself. This is because I went abroad to improve my relationship with my husband and because he sent me. Over there, I had to do sex work. Once I ""accepted"", my salary increased. But inside myself, I could not find peace. I just thought when would it all be over. I counted the days. I was always tense. On the day I heard I was being released, I thanked Allah a thousand times. I was so happy I couldn’t tell you. I was liberated from a jail. It was like a second birth. You have to make yourself so small. You always live in fear. Only I know this.

At first, I refused. She tried to convince me, and then she hit me. I told her, send me back to Bangladesh. I want to go back to the garment factory but she did not listen. She said that girls who came here could only enter. They could not leave. I was confined in that house for 9 months. I was never allowed out. At first, I pleaded with customers not to have sex with me. Many paid the fee and left without using me. I received none of that money. [After 9 months confinement in a private brothel, Joynob took Piyara to Shonagachi. There, Piyara quarrelled with her.] Why she never paid me? Here, other girls gave me ideas to fight her. [Once in Sonagachi, Piyare no longer objected to sex work but wanted to be paid. She broke away from Joynob and began working as an adiya, and later as an independent sex worker] Joynob is still after me. She wants my money because she knows I am earning well. A few months ago, she offered to accompany me to get an abortion. I don't know what she fed me but I felt very sick in my head afterwards. She hit me many times. When I told others that she had fed me some harmful medicine, she said I was mad. Joynob then decided that I should go home because I was not well. She made me withdraw all my savings at the bank in preparation for the trip. I had 82,000 rupees in all.

We were 60 girls in one building. Quite a few were Nepali. Under one malkeen, there were 10 girls. Most days, I did 6 to 7 men, sometimes I did more. Clients were Pakistani, Saudi, Kuwaiti and Indian. At first, I did not like it, and then it was O.K. If a girl refused to work, she was beaten. We could not go out. We were prisoners. Customers paid the malkeen and after a customer left we were searched in case we hid some money. It was not possible to run away. But even if we could, where would I have gone?

Mala,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,Children,India (slavery location),"Roma (known as Sita Di in the brothel) persuaded my parents to send me with her so that I could look after her 7 year old son. With her cunning proposal, my parents fell in the trap. She brought me to Sonagachi. I understood very quickly what kind of place it was but I could not escape. Sita Di pushed me into this work. I never thought it could happen to me. […] ""If my father knew where I am, he would have a heart attack. I came here 1½ month ago. My aunt brought me. I was a student at the madrassah. Sitadi convinced my parents to take me with her to look after her 7 year old son. She said to my father: - ""You are my relative. How could I want to spoil the honour of your daughter?"" Hearing these words, my father agreed. There was probably another reason why my father let me go. I had a love affair with a village boy. Our fathers quarreled about a piece of land and my father did not want me to continue with this relationship. He thought that if I went away for 2-3 months, I would forget about the boy. That is why he agreed to let me go so easily. When I came to Sitadi's room, I understood everything. I am not that young. At first, she tried to convince me to do this work for the money but I did not agree. Then she locked me up with customers. I cried a lot. I did not want to go with them. I hit some of them. I still have not been given any money. Actually, I don't want that money. All I want is to go back home. One customer told me he could help me to get away but I was afraid to trust him. What if he sells me somewhere else? I am not allowed to go out except one day when Sita took me to a circus. She wanted to teach me everything. She said not to tell my real name or my real age. Police may come disguised as a customer. I do as she tells me. Sitadi told me she would take me to visit our village in May. I am eagerly waiting for this, so I try to please her. If I can go once, I will never come back. She lied to me. Why did she ask me to do this kind of work? She could have appointed me to a humble job but not to sex work. I will tell when I go home. Sitadi will not be able to stand in front of my parents. Sitadi met the boy who loves me. She threatened him. If you come to India, I will teach you, she said. Here I am selling my body. I could do this with the boy who loves me but not with so many strangers. Sitadi always visits our village with her Kabuli husband. That is why people do not suspect her profession and she could convince my parents. She changed my name to Menuka. It is the name of a goddess.

Many dalals were sending men to me. They advertised a new girl. Barek and Chompa together, they managed me. One day, I could not take it anymore. I went on the balcony and jumped from the 2nd floor. Barek and Chompa immediately took me to a private clinic where I was kept for one month. I wanted to die but I just broke my right leg. Rekha and Barek told me that my treatment cost them 1,00,000 rupees. When I was taken back, they insisted that I work even harder to reimburse my debt. Pressure on me was even worst than before. I told my sorrow to another girl and she spoke to the Durbar supervisor. The latter contacted the club people. Together, they forced Chompa and Barek to release me. I was then placed under another malkeen as an adiya. The cost of my treatment was checked and it was only 28,000-30,000 rupees, which I had certainly earned through my previous work. Barek and Chompa tried to claim me back but the club protects me. What Barek did to me, I cannot explain it. I have nightmares about him. He cursed me. He vowed that I would never marry. He used to tell me not to reveal that I came from a good family and that I had studied up to Class VIII.     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub      "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Setara,2002 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation,Sexual exploitation,India (slavery location),"We are 3 sisters and 3 brothers. Our family was very poor and I had to look for a job early. An elderly woman from a neighbouring village proposed to my mother that I accompany her to Kolkata where she would find me a job. That woman sold me in Sonagachi. I was 15 years old. The fist year, my malkeen kept all my income. The next two years, I worked as an adiya under the same malkeen. Meanwhile, I learned about the brothel and brought my elder sister. As an adiya, I had a babu (a regular man/lover). Eventually we married and I left the brothel. I stayed outside with him for a few years but I was not happy. Everyday, he reminded me of where I came from. I did not conceive, and he blamed me for it. While in the para, I had an abortion and I probably damaged my womb. Because of his bad treatment, I returned to the brothel. In a short while, I got another babu and, with his help, I became a malkeen. There was no divorce with the first babu but he does not come anymore. My second babu is about 42 years old and is well connected with the club. I visit the village with my babu several times a year. We cross the border at Hakimpur. The cost is one thousand taka per return trip for the two us. I have adopted one daughter. She is now 5 years old and lives with my mother in the village.     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub    "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Tamanna,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,India (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"We are four sisters and one brother. My father is a day labourer. When I was at home, my parents often quarreled and we quarreled with our parents because food was short. My mother used to tell me to leave when we had these fights. I would reply that one day I would do so. I came here because of my younger sister, Monzila. Two months ago, she left her husband's home after a fight and Yunus exploited the situation. He took her to Sonagachi. My father suspected this and alerted people. He called one journalist and informed the police. He told them: ""I believe Yunus took my daughter to India and sold her there.” Pressure mounted on Yunus. He argued that he left Monzila at his sister's house in Kolkata and if my father wanted her back, he could bring her. After a few days, Yunus brought Monzila back home. He trained her in such a way that she did not want to stay. Monzila told my parents that she was happy in Kolkata and that she wanted to go back. After 7 days, she returned with Yunus. One month later, Yunus came to our home and said that Manzila was very ill and she wanted to see her sister Tamanna. My parents sent me straight away. When I reached here, I realized my sister was in a brothel. I saw that she was not sick at all. I asked her what she was doing here. She did not reply. I asked Setara and Yunus to send me back to the village. They said, all right, you can go back, but alone. But how could I go? I did not have any money. My sister said she had none. Three days later, I was given my first customer. He paid 110 rupees. This was the first man in my life. I have been here for one month. I don't go out much. The police raid the place. With the customers I have, I can hardly cover my cost. My sister Monzila has gone outside to a district town. The dalal took her. She will come back after a few days. He gave the malkeen 400 rupees per day for her. If my sister earns more than this, it is the dalal and the hotel manager's profit. I am new here. My malkeen has not sent me outside yet. My parents know I have gone to Kolkata. They had no objection because they believed what my sister told them. Everyone believed my sister. Her story sounded so good, how could they not believe her.     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

My stepmother made me work very hard for the family. She regularly beat me. By the age of 14, I started protesting. My father came back tired one night and he pushed me out of the house. I took shelter at a neighbour. Three days later, I visited another village with that family. There, I met Hamida. She offered to take me to Mumbai, teach me dance and fix a good job for me.  -""You will be able to earn well and fend for yourself"", she said. I left without informing my father. I did not have a clear idea about bar work. The first 3 months, she kept me and taught me to dance. I was quite happy to put on beautiful clothes and learn to dance. I felt like a cinema heroin. She gave me good food. I called her Nanni (maternal grand-mother). I trusted her. She used to say: -""When you earn, I will look after your money and when you go home, you will be able to buy land. You will see your father will love you."" I never suspected Nanni could cheat me. I returned one month ago. She gave me 4,000 rupees and promised that her jamai (daughter's husband) would give me the rest. - ""The money will be transported through a hundi agent. It is too dangerous to carry such large amount yourself. You could get stolen. Look for land you can buy and the money will follow."" I brought gifts for my family. My father looked for land. Today, I came to get the money and Hamida's jamai said nothing had come for me. I could not believe it. Hamida owes me 1,00,000 rupees. I was a good earner.

Ruma,2002 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",India (slavery location),"My father was a richshawallah in Khulna. We were very poor. I was the eldest of 3 sisters and 1 brother. One day my cousin (mamato bon) offered to take me to Mumbai. My parents agreed. This was in 1981-82. I was 11 years old. I was supposed to work in her house for 1 or 2 years, then she would arrange my marriage if she found a suitable boy. I worked in her house for 7 to 8 months and, when I understood the language, the bitch sold me to a woman from Kolkata for sex work. I worked and I cried everyday. I was like a parrot in a cage. I was taught the language, I was fed when I pleased my keeper and I had no possibility to go out. The work was not the worst. I missed my family terribly. My cousin sometimes came to collect the money. When I asked her about my income she would reply: -""You are a child, yet you speak like a grown up. Your money is there. When you go home, you can take it with you."" After one year I was freed. Then I myself decided to work in a bar. I understood that my cousin intended to sell me off as a wife to a man in Uttar Pradesh. One Bangladeshi woman helped me to escape and introduced me to bar work. Later, I paid her 10,000 rupees. Two years after going to Mumbai, I recovered my freedom. I then renewed contact with my family and started sending them money through people. If I had been married, this would not have been possible. My cousin was angry with me. I did not keep in touch with her and I never got the money she took from me. My work was a disgusting one but I was pleased to be able to send money home. One day, I met Ali Hussain. We agreed on a contract and I married him. I had learned a lot by then and I did not trust people easily. I made conditions very clear. After marriage, I would split my income in two: half to my family and half to my husband. I worked 8 years after this. In the end, I left because I was pregnant. We have a 5 month old child. I have bad sores on my skin. I also have heavy white discharge like pus and it smells. I sought treatment in Mumbai. I was already pregnant when I did and the doctor told me this condition could affect my child. This is why we left. I am paying for my past sins. I feel depressed. I cannot hide my condition.     Narrative located in the report ‘Beyond Boundaries: A Critical Look at Women Labour Migration and the Trafficking Within’ by Thérèse Blanchet provided courtesy of The Child Protection Hub    "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Jesmin,2002 (Narrative date),Children Migration,Migration,India (slavery location),"I was small when we went to Mumbai but I remember everything. We had a hard time. No money. We crossed the boarder on foot at Sultanpur. We were very hungry but we could not eat. In Bithary, we stopped at Shahjahan's house and he fed us. For 3 days we traveled on a train. Shahjahan fed us all kinds of food. We worked in Papri, Shatshola, then we settled. Taslima and Anna bubu later came to live with us. At first, I worked in a hotel, then with my sisters, I went to work in a bar. My sister Rima used to dance and I sold alcohol. My sister had also sold alcohol at first. My little sister massaged people (manusher shoril banaito). My little brother stayed inside the house with my father. When my father visited Bangladesh, he stayed alone. My mother worked in a different bar. Taslima and Anna, they also worked in a bar elsewhere. After lunch, a car came to pick us up. My work was a little bit better than my elder sister. To go with men, that was very painful, disgusting, difficult work (khub koshter kaj). I did not want to go. Mother punished me. She hit me, withdrew food and yelled names at me. For one year, I poured drinks. Then, I was made to do this other work. I went with men. Different kinds of men. I was afraid of their looks. Some were my father's age. My mother and my father are not good people. They asked all of us sisters to do this work. If parents order their children to do such work, what is left for the children. My father wasted our money by gambling; he put women to work, hung around and spent their money. That is why my mother quarreled with him. My mother did not give all her money to my father. This money is not earned easily, so it is very precious. Father wasted Taslima and Anna's money also. Now, they don't give their money to him. That is why they quarrel a lot. We dressed well and we ate well over there but I prefer to live in the village even if I were to starve. Before marriage, girls are under their parents' authority and after marriage, they are under their husband. We were taught that girls who do as they like becomes beadop (self willed - uncontrollable which is not seen here as a quality).

On the third floor of the bar, I massaged men. These men, they hurt me. They grabbed me and they bit me. By force, they got me to lie down. Big fat men came. They frightened me and I cried. When I complained to mother, she said: - ""There is no work at home, no food. You must stick it out here for a few years, save money. We have to arrange your marriage. Besides, no one sees the kind of work we do here, no one knows. Life is hardship, you must learn this.

Bukola Oriola (Narrative 2),2011 (Narrative date),Trafficking Migration,Nigeria (trafficked from) Migration,United States (slavery location),"Yes, my main goal is to let victims know that help is available. So, if there’s anybody out there who is suffering, they need to call for help because those people at the other side of the phone are those that will help them and get them rescued. Most of the time a victim has been threatened so much with the law, the police and immigration and they are unable to speak out because there is nobody to trust. You don’t know who to talk to. Because, in my case, I suffered for two years. I suffered isolation, I suffered hunger in the land of plenty. […] Here, in Minnesota where people are struggling to lose weight, I was not gaining weight, even in pregnancy. I was suffering. I couldn’t eat whatever I craved as a pregnant woman, and I was working while somebody else was taking the money, my trafficker and it’s the same for so many victims, they work while somebody is taking their money. Either they work as a sex worker, or they work as a labour workers working somewhere. In my own case I was brought here and somebody else was taking the money from me. I couldn’t wear right clothes, during winter I didn’t even have winter jackets in Minnesota. And I was depressed, I didn’t even know that I was depressed to the point that I could not even recognize myself in the mirror anymore, I just saw a strange woman staring back at me each time I look in the mirror. And I thought that death was the only way out. I almost committee suicide. But I thank God that help came at the point that I didn’t expect. […] I got here through a work visa, because I’m a journalist from Nigeria and I covered education and international new and I was here to cover the United Nations in 1005 when the organisation was celebrating its 50th anniversary and general assembly. So, when I came it was in New York but then I had been married to the person that became my trafficker traditionally in my country. Because in Nigeria there are 3 types of marriage, there is the traditional marriage, there is the Christian marriage and the Muslim marriage. So, I did a traditionally marriage where both families agreed that we were husband and wife. […] I had not met him, yes. But he was living in Minnesota and my job brought me to New York. So, he invited me to Minnesota to meet him face to face before I went back home. But when I came, he didn’t let me go back. He encouraged me to stay, he promised my family that he would change my work visa to a spousal visa, and since there was already and agreement between the families, I was encouraged to stay, not knowing that I was agreeing to an event that almost cost me my life. […] We first of all we lived in Ramsay and Ramsay is a bush, because there are bushes all over the place and you don’t have access to public transportation. I didn’t know how to drive so I was trapped in the house. I only went out whenever he wanted me to go out. […] And sometimes even when we’d go to the store for clothes, we’d go just as the store was about to close, because when we get into the store, not so long I will be hearing them announcing that all customers should come to the register because the store will close in 10 minutes. And then I will rush and pick whatever I could grab, and we would leave the store. I didn’t know what my size of was. In the store, I concluded that America don’t produce my size because I always went for… had time to get know the stores. And it’s the same for many victims. They are followed, they, you know are accompanied all the time. You can’t break off because somebody is always watching you and guiding you. Even in the eyes of the public It might not seem so, it might look normal, but the person that is suffering knows that it is not normal, but you cannot speak out because you’ve lost your sense of trust for anyone, you cannot speak to anyone. […] The luck I had was that there was a public health nurse that used to come to the house. So, she was the one who helped me to get out. Actually, when I was pregnant, he had taken me to weekly appointments and at the week appointments I was asked if I wanted a public health nurse and I said yes, and she was coming home to check me during pregnancy, and after the birth of the baby, I encouraged her to continue to come. And even though he was asking me, ‘when will she stop coming, when will she stop coming’? because that was like an outsider. […] But I kept encouraging her to come because I saw that she was concerned for me, she cared about how I fared and when the time came to jump, even though I didn’t know what I was jumping in to, because he had been threatening with the police and immigration and to take the child away from me. And I was so afraid also that the child might die because his health deteriorated so much that we were going from clinic to hospital, he wasn’t growing. […] So, you know, he actually called the police to make false allegations against me so that I could go to jail and then be deported. And I was afraid that the child might die to because he wouldn’t take care of the child. So, I called the public health nurse for help and then she referred me to Alexandra House, a battered women’s shelter because obviously there is not shelter for victims of human trafficking. But if you are a woman, the battered women’s shelter will take you. And they took me, and it was at the battered woman’s shelter that I began to receive help so that they referred me into mental health therapy because I was depressed, and they also referred me for immigration help. I was referred to a support group for immigrant women and refugees and it was at that group that I got connected to Civil Society. And I am grateful to Civil Society today because erm I am watching my weight because I am eating well, I’m faring well and I’m so glad my child… […] Thanks to Civil Society for that support. Because Civil Society got me an immigration lawyer at no cost to me and a petition was filed with the US CIS and then I was granted status to remain and work here and take care of my child and I’m grateful. We got help also with house and the healing transitional housing gave us you know 2-bedroom apartment to live in comfortably and they cared for us. And now my son is growing, he’s healthy, he starts first grade this fall. […] He’s been doing well, he’s been growing. Before we got to the shelter he used to be resentful towards people, he doesn’t go with people, he doesn’t relate with people because we were both isolated. The only person he could relate with was me, but now, he is relating with other people, he’s going to school and relating with people, he’s doing so well and so grateful for the help we got. […] I hope that the government will keep working hard to prosecute even though there is only 1 victim involved. Because if they don’t prosecute, even if the trafficked is just one person, there is a tendency for the person to traffick in another person and torture another person. […] The person is still here in this State but he doesn’t have contact with us. […] Actually, when we were with him, I didn’t see him with any weapon like guns. What he was using as a weapon against me was the law. And now the truth is open to the eyes of the law, so he can’t use that as a weapon against me anymore, rather it has turned against him. So, I don’t see him, the child doesn’t see him. […] It’s a struggle that erm I have, I wish that my son could have a relationship with his father because I come from a home of unity, love and I grew up in a home where I had opportunity to relate with my father and my mother. But it’s unfortunate that my son doesn’t have that kind of caring father, but right now, I can say that he has a male model in his life that he can relate with and it’s been doing so well. I am so grateful to God for that male role model in his life, because he’s involved in school activities, he’s always there for him and he’s happy with him. […] My speaking out in my community is a struggle but I don’t mind going through that struggle if only 1 life will be saved. And you know, I see that there is a need because when my story came out there have been all kinds of negative comments on the internet from my community about me, blaming me for the torture endured, saying it was my fault. But it boiled down to lack of education in this area and that is why I am speaking out, you know in order to educate my community and other communities that are not educated in this area. So that we can know that it is wrong for someone to torture another person and that we should not be blaming the victims, rather you should be giving help to the victims and the police need to work with organisations like Civil society, because I could have gone to jail. The police that came out, they were not friendly with me, they were not willing to work with me, I hope that they will take the time. It’s a lot more work for you to want to really listen to somebody and really find out the truth and a victim will not speak to you unless the victim has some confidence and some trust in you. Even when a victim comes into contact with police, already I have been victimised with the police. The police were the weapon my trafficker was using against me. So, I didn’t have the courage to even tell the police a lot and they were not willing to take the time, because it’s a pain to really take the time and find out what the truth is, like Civil Society is doing. And I hope that they can work well with Civil Society and really find out about the truth, investigate further and let the victim know that you are there for the victim. Because if you don’t show that you are there for the victim, the victim will never open up to you. As told in an interview with Judy Corraro "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). The US attracts migrants and refugees who are particularly at risk of vulnerability to human trafficking. Trafficking victims often responding to fraudulent offers of employment in the US migrate willingly and are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in industries such as forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Bukola Oriola, a Nigerian international news journalist was on a visit to New York to cover the UN 50th Anniversary, when she was invited by the man who it had arranged would be her husband to visit him in Minnesota. Upon arrival, he convinced her to stay, organising a spousal visa. However, Bukola soon found herself confined to the home with her movements monitored at all times. She was finally able to escape her situation after the birth of her child with the help of a public health nurse."
Shahida,2014 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,Children,Afghanistan (slavery location),""," There are an estimated 749,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Afghanistan (GSI 2018). Afghanistan remains a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subjected for forced labour and sex trafficking, with internal trafficking being more prevalent than transnational. Victims of trafficking in the country are subjected to bonded labour, in which whole families are often trapped, along with children being exploited in carpet making and brick factories, domestic servitude, commercial sex, begging and drug smuggling.  Shahida was 13 years old when she was forced to marry a 45 year old man. Though she ran away, her father forced her to return to her husband, when she refused, he attempted to bury her alive. Shahida was eventually able to escape to a shelter and then was able to get the help she needed from Hagar International.   "
Anessa,1988 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Bangladesh (trafficked from),Kuwait (slavery location),""," There are an estimated 592,000 people living in modern slavery in Bangladesh (GSI 2018). Men, women and children are subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.  Bangladesh is host to more than 1 million undocumented Rohingya, including hundreds of thousands who fled Burma in previous decades. The Rohingya community’s stateless status and inability to work legally increases their vulnerability to human trafficking. Rohingya women and girls are reportedly recruited from refugee camps for domestic work and are instead subjected to sex trafficking. Within the country, Bangladeshi children and adults are subjected to sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and forced and bonded labor, in which traffickers exploit an initial debt assumed by a worker as part of the employment terms.     Anessa was 13 years old when she married her 50 year old employer Samad. Once married, Samad told Anessa that she would go work abroad. A job was found for Samad in Kuwait, where upon arrival, she was told she would engage in sex work. Samad sent what money she received back to her husband, however upon returning to Bangladesh found out that her husband had divorced her.  "
Laila,"",Forced marriage Children,Children,United Kingdom (slavery location),"I was born in Iran. I lived there with my mum and dad and my two younger sisters, Homa and Maryam. My parents, particularly my dad, spoke about their dreams for us, going to university and having careers. It didn’t matter to them that we were girls. Due to my dad’s political activities, it became too dangerous for us to live in Iran, so we moved to Cyprus when I was 11. Soon after, my mother was diagnosed with Leukaemia, and we were sent to the UK so that she could receive treatment. When I was 12 years old, my mother passed away. Homa was 10 and Maryam was four. Within the year my dad got remarried, to an Iranian woman, who had been married before as a child when she was 13. Everything changed. She was strict and controlling. Before we’d been allowed to hang out with our friends at the shopping centre, but suddenly we weren’t allowed to go out or have friends around, not even girls from our community, because she thought they were too westernised and a bad influence. After school we had to get home within 45 minutes. She put a stop to pocket money and controlled what we wore. She blackmailed us emotionally, telling us that if we didn’t obey, our dad would have a heart attack. She’d shout and scream and my dad became this horrible person. We feared them both. And there was the threat that if we did not behave as expected, we would be sent to Iran to be married off. She talked constantly about how women and girls should behave. She was training us to be good housewives. This is all she thought our futures should hold. All three of us, even Maryam who was only six years old at that time, had to cook, clean, and look after our step-mother’s own sons and the baby she’d had with my dad. Everything had to be immaculate; every day we had to vacuum and dust everything again. It was like we were her slaves. I knew that my future husband would be chosen for me, but I was in denial about it, just hoping it wouldn’t happen. I had other plans. I wanted to go to university. But it was a constant struggle to get time to study. My step-mother would say ‘it’s not important, you’re a girl, what good will it do?’ Once I faked a note from my school saying I had to come in during half term, so I could go to the library and work. I was totally miserable, and walked around just wanting to cry, with this horrible sick feeling in my stomach.   I went from always getting A grades in all of my A-Level subjects, to D’s and E’s. This got the attention of my teachers, but they clearly did not understand “honour” based violence and they did not know what to do with us. They wanted to call my dad and step-mother in, to talk about why I was down, not realising that in “honour” based violence cases it is dangerous to mediate with the perpetrators. I was terrified that if my school spoke to my dad and step-mother, we would straight away be put on a plane to Iran to be forced into marriage. There was no referral to any specialist support group or social services and it was clear that the school didn’t have any policies for cases like ours. We’d never been taught about our right not to face “honour” based violence or forced marriage, if we had, I would have felt more confident that our school understood these issues. But, because they were not spoken about and the school obviously did not know how to help us, I did not trust that I could be open about the full extent of the abuse that we were experiencing and we continued to suffer in silence. Maryam was very timid and had bitten all of her nails away. She wore the same ripped jeans and stained jumper every day and she was being bullied. It was obvious that she was suffering. However her primary school never looked into the reasons for this. To protect my sisters, I tried to avoid confrontation. Homa did a few normal teenage things, like rip her jeans and listen to music, which made my stepmother anxious that she was getting too westernised and might shame the family. When I was taking my A-Levels and Homa was sitting her G.C.S.E’s, Homa overheard my step-mother and my dad making plans for her marriage to a 40 year old man. We knew him, because we’d been taken to visit the family, but we’d had no idea that reason was to display us as potential brides. A friend of our step-mother, who’d recently fallen out with her, was taking English lessons in our school building. We asked her whether what Homa had overheard was true. Our hearts sank when she confirmed our fears. Homa, was seen as the more immediate threat to the “honour” of the family, so to control her and prevent her from bringing perceived shame on our family, she was going to be forced to marry. We knew that there was no chance that we could change the minds of our step-mother and dad. If we tried, they’d probably send us to forced marriages in Iran. I didn’t trust that our schools would know how to protect us and feared they would try to speak to our step-mother and father if we approached them so I dared not tell them about the arrangements for Homa’s forced marriage. For Homa and me, the school term had ended because we’d finished our exams. As soon as we had the opportunity, a few days later when our step-mother and dad went out with the baby, we called the police. They said that because the house was tidy and clean and we didn’t have any bruises to show them, there was nothing they could do. When we told them about the imminent forced marriage, they said ‘that’s your culture isn’t it?’ That really shocked us. They were supposed to protect us, but they were just going to leave us to face abuse. Now-days I think the police do have a better understanding of “honour” based violence, but it is so important that schools do too; they must have a role in supporting their pupils and ensuring that they get the protection and help they need. Our step-mum and dad were due back any minute and they would find out straight away that we’d called the police, because our step brothers, who were in the playground at their primary school, right opposite our house, had seen the police car and so had our neighbours. As no-one, not our school, or the police seemed to understand the danger that we were in, we felt that we were on our own. We had no choice but to run away. First we had to get Maryam. The most important thing was for the three of us to be together. Homa and I each grabbed a small bag, in mine I put a picture of my mum and my diary, and we ran over the road to get Maryam from her primary school. One of our step brothers, who attended the same school, saw us going to Maryam’s classroom and told us to come outside, because our dad was there. I told him to go and tell dad that we were coming, then we ran out of the back door, through the woods to the bus stop. The woman who had confirmed the plans for Homa’s wedding with us, allowed us to stay with her for a few weeks. We informed social services that we had Maryam, and they arranged for us to speak with dad. He told us to return, only to stop shaming the family. He tried to blackmail us emotionally. The one thing that I am grateful to him for, is that he did not fight for custody of Maryam. Social services left on our own to look after ourselves after that. The three of us started our news lives together. We found a flat and Homa and I each got two jobs, to pay the bills. Maryam, who had been shy, blossomed into a confident girl and Homa studied for her A-Levels. With everything that had happened, I had not got the grades that I needed to take up my place at university, but I studied hard, did retakes and got a place studying Biomedical Sciences at King’s College. I pursued my dreams and today I work as a trainee surgeon and have PhD. In spite of everything, we survived. But it has been very tough. Looking back I know that things could have been very different for us if our schools had taught us about our rights not to face “honour” based violence and forced marriage, if they has informed us where to get the help we needed and if they had really understood what we were going through so that they could have given us the support that we needed from them.

Esther,"",Forced marriage Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),"When people hear my story, they say they’re heartbroken. But I share it with you now in the hopes that maybe it will be able to help somebody, somewhere. I hope it will show you why you should end child marriage and protect girls age 17 and younger from what I went through. I was barely 17 when I got married in New York. I came from a poor family, in an insular Hassidic community where everyone’s marriage is arranged at a young age. I didn’t have any other choices in life. Somebody suggested to my parents that I marry this boy, who comes from money, and I said, What the heck? It’s the thing to do. I was a 17-year-old girl raised in such a sheltered life, I didn’t even know my vagina was called a vagina. I had never gone on a date or had a boyfriend. I was a baby. How can a 17-year-old girl raised in such a sheltered life make that sort of decision? However, upon meeting the boy, I knew he wasn’t for me. We got to meet for a half hour, and he sat there with his shirt buttoned up to his nose, and he kept burping. After a half hour my father came into the room and said, So, is this a mazel tov [congratulations]? I said I didn’t know. And then the boy’s father came in and said, Mazel tov! I thought, I guess I’m engaged. The next morning I knew I had made the biggest mistake of my life. I needed a way out. But I thought about the shame that would bring my parents, and I went along with it. We were engaged for four months, and we were not allowed to see each other. As the engagement continued, I realized a lot of lies were being covered up. I was initially told he was 21, but I learned he was actually 23. I found out he smoked, when I didn’t want to marry a smoker. But what could I do? I was so naïve at 17, I didn’t understand why my parents signed my marriage license application. I thought all parents signed for their children. I didn’t know I needed “parental consent” because I was not yet 18. I was 17 and so innocent. My biggest sin was I wanted to wear nail polish. And now I’m married to him, and on our wedding night, after we did the deed, he looked at me said, If you think you’re my first, you’re not. I’ve been having sex with prostitutes. I was shocked. I started to cry, and he yelled at me for crying, yelled that he had married a woman with mental issues. I quickly learned not to show real emotion. He must have raped me a million times while we were married. But there were also gang rapes. He told me he had fantasies of watching me have sex with other men, while he hid in a closet. I learned quickly that the only way I could protect myself, the only way to survive, was to behave in ways that made me very uncomfortable. He would threaten me that he was from a rich family, and he would take away our children and leave me without my children, without money or food. He was drinking a lot. I found out later he was also doing drugs. I had never seen a drunk person before. I had never seen abuse before. I was a baby, but I was not allowed to use birth control, and soon I had a baby. I was 18. And then I was pregnant again, and he told me, You’re not skinny. You’re not wearing the tight black dress I want you to wear. For my 21st birthday he took me to strip club. I had never been to a strip club before. And he chose a table at the far end and made me walk from one end of the room to the other, so he could watch other men ogle me. I remember I was wearing a light blue dress, part of a suit that came with a jacket on top, but I had to wear it without the jacket. It was my first time dressing in a way I knew to be immodest. I had no ability to be true to me. Finally, after nine years, after the millionth time he raped me when he was drunk, I looked in the mirror and saw a reflection I didn’t recognize. I knew it was time to get out. It was on a Shabbos [Sabbath], and I took my kids and my paperwork, and I went to my mother’s house. My parents made me go back home, and I went back home, but I was done. I told my parents about the rapes, about the gang rapes, and everything that had taken place, and then they supported me. I crushed my parents that day. I love my parents to death, and I don’t blame them in this. They were raised with the same mentality, the same ideas. They didn’t have a chance to grow and mature, so how could they raise children to grow and mature? Maybe if my parents couldn’t just sign for me, and they had to wait until I was 18, I would have gotten stronger and would have been able to stand up to them. My dependence on them at 17 was severe. I couldn’t stand up for myself and say, This is not what I want. I now have a 17-year-old daughter, and I tell her that part of growing up is figuring out who you are. How can you figure out who you are before you’re even halfway there? Do most people know who they are at 17? The more time a child has to grow and mature, it allows them more time to make lifelong decisions. Marriage is legally binding. You are now forever stuck to uphold that legally binding contract. Having to say yes to something so serious at such a young age is like signing a contract in a language you don’t understand. Yes, a minority of 17-year-olds are strong-minded and are able to make good decisions, but most are not. Those who are mature and capable of making healthy decisions will be able to wait until 18, for the sake of the others who are less mature. Give children the chance to wait until 18, especially those who grew up in insular religious communities and have no Internet access or reading materials. They might say, Yes, this was my decision. But do they know there are other options? Even today, years after I left, my entire life is based on my getting married at 17. Every aspect of my life, my children, my relationship, all my struggles, go back to my marriage at 17. Now you have the power to prevent what happened to me from happening to another 17-year-old girl. I beg you, please. End child marriage!     Narrative provided by Unchained at Last"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).  Among this number, are children subjected to forced marriage. A study published on child marriage in 2011 determined that the prevalence of child marriage among women in the US was 8.9 percent, meaning that over 9.4 million US women were married at age 16 or younger. Forced marriage and child marriage are understudies problems within the United States and more research is needed to determine what drives its occurrence. Esther was 17 years old when she was forced to marry a boy against her will. She was subjected to emotional, physical and sexual abuse daily by her husband. After 9 years, Esther was finally able divorce her abusive husband, however was coerced into having her divorce arbitrated by a religious court that deemed she must raise her children in the same insular religion in which she was raised and married. Unchained provided Esther with an attorney who was able to win Esther full custody of her children and the rise to raise them as she chooses."
Ira,2018 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,Belarus (trafficked from) ,Russia (slavery location),""," There are an estimated 794,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in Russia (GSI 2018). Women and children are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking in prostitution and pornography. Women are lured by the promise of lucrative employment and a new location, travelling to the country under the pretence of legitimate employment and a better life. However, when they arrive, they are forced into prostitution in brothels, hotels and saunas. There is also evidence of traffickers advertising sexual services of children online. However, despite the evidence of sex trafficking in Russia, it remains an under-recognised area of enslavement in the country.  Ira is from a small town in the Vitebsk region of Belarus. Never having a close relationship with her mother, she ran away numerous times. Ira married young and gave birth to a daughter, however the family had little money and no stable accommodation. Ira returned to her mother but found their relationship had not improved. As Ira had little education, it was difficult for her to find a job in her small town. Her neighbour introduced her to a friend from St. Petersburg who earned money by providing escort services. Ira travelled to Russia to work, however upon arrival the work was not what Ira was promised. She found herself forced to provide sexual services to men who could often be violent. Ira escaped one day, jumping from a third story window, sustaining injuries that led to her being unable to walk and confined to a wheelchair. Ira has now found stable employment and has received psychological and reintegration assistance within the counter-trafficking programme implemented by the IOM office in Belarus."

Muttam Jyotsna,2018 (Narrative date),Forced marriage Children,India (trafficked from) Children,India (slavery location),"I was begging at a nearby mosque. I was about 13 years old and fell in love with a boy who was also begging near the mosque. We went for movies, ate ice cream and had fun. I would keep part of what I got from begging and give my mother the rest. Soon my mother found out about this from my younger sister, who also came with me to beg. She stopped us both from begging. After about a year, I started to work as a helper in a garments store. I earned Rs.3,000 per month of which I kept Rs.1,000 with myself. I made friends with a boy at the store and liked being with him. Again, my mother found out and stopped me from work. I was at home and had nothing much to do after washing vessels, cooking and other domestic chores. I would wander around the neighbourhood and this is when I got interested in another boy. We met every day, day after day, and were very fond of each other. As he was also a Dalit and from the same caste and from a known family, our parents decided to get us married.’ ‘I was 15 years old then. After marriage, we were living with the boy’s parents and his elder sister in a small village. I could not do anything without permission from my mother-in-law. At home, I thought my mother was strict since she always scolded me. But now I can see the difference. I am not allowed to eat as much food as I want or dress up well. My husband stopped taking me out for movies or to the market. He began to drink and beat me up without any reason. I was being scolded even after working hard - doing all the cooking, fetching water and firewood and other domestic work. The tension in the house was unbearable and I forced him to shift back to the city near my mother’s house. In the city I went back to working in a shop, he went for casual work. My husband continues to drink, comes home late and beats me up. He never takes me out. He does not bring friends home nor take me to meet them. After two years of marriage, I delivered a baby girl. My husband wanted a boy and was disappointed. But he took care of me during my pregnancy. My delivery was in a hospital close to mother’s house.

Francis Bok,2007  (Narrative date),Children War slavery,Sudan (trafficked from) War slavery,Sudan (slavery location),"Hello my name is Francis Bok, I wanna talk about my experiences here’s my story. In 1986 when I was 7 years old in my former country Sudan, my mother asked me one evening to go to the local market to sell eggs and beans. I went to the market, where there are militia from North Sudan came to the market and killed the people around me. And they captured me and many other kids. And after they finished, once they had destroyed everything on the market, they marched us all to the North, and we were divided up to militia mans. I was given to the guy named Juma Abdullah who took me to his farm and he sent his children to beat me, and they were always shouting. Saying Abeed, Abeed. So one day, I learned Arabic in a few months Juma come to me to bring me something to eat and before he returns. I asked him why he called me Abeed and the whole family called me Abeed, black slave. And why they forced me to sleep with the animals. And I also asked him why no one loved me, my master didn’t answer my question. His answer was beat me. He grabbed a stick and beat me with the stick and he told me never ever ask me again these questions. Two days later he came to me and he said, the reason we called you Abeed, black slave and make you sleep with the animals is because you are an animal. I used to cry daily, day and night. They never ever felt my pain and what was going through with me as a young child. I finally said its time to get away from this farm. It’s time to really leave this family and seek for the place that I can be free and live as a human being. So, I lived a double life with him until when I reached the age of 14 years old, 7 years working with them, I first decided to escape. I failed my first attempt because I went the wrong direction, because I didn’t know nowhere when I were taken to that community. I was too young, 7 years old, and I didn’t know anything. So, someone else saw me and the brought me back to my master’s home. So, I waited three more years, I didn’t rush until when I was 17 years old. Which is 1996. I finally said it is time to get away from this farm. So, I made my last decisions and commitment to escape. For 10 years I was serving the master as his slave. And 10 years later, I escaped and made my way to the capital city of Sudan, Khartoum, where I spent two years and eventually made my way to Cairo, Egypt in 1998. In 1999 with the help of the UN I made my way to the United States, to Fargo, North Dakota. In 2000 I decided to work with American antislavery groups and the human rights organisations for fighting against slavery worldwide in Boston, Massachusetts. And today I speaks at many public schools, colleges and universities and community centres and Christian churches and synagogues. To tell my personal story and to speak on behalf of my people, South Sudanese. In order to speak on behalf of 27 million people who are still enslaved today worldwide. I have to use my freedom to free those who are still in my positions. Because for 10 years I lay awake at night and wonder who’s going to come and free me? And I’m glad I actually made my way to freedom and this way I call myself a lucky man."," There are an estimated 465,000 people living in modern slavery in Sudan (GSI 2018). Between 1983 and 2005, the central government of Sudan enslaved tens of thousands of black South Sudanese Christian and traditionalist people. It was part of a genocidal war against South Sudan, with a simple aim: to force South Sudan to become Arab and Muslim. Francis was seven years old when he was taken by North Sudanese militia and enslaved on a farm in North Sudan. He was beaten and force to sleep with the animals. After 10 years Francis was finally able to escape. He now travels around with antislavery organisations telling his story and raising awareness of modern day slavery. "
Dee Clark,2016 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (Slavery location),"I was in and out of foster care. My mother kissed and hugged us and loved us, but she kicked and punched and spit on us too. My older brothers abused us, I don’t have as clear memory, but physically abused us yes, and they were just odd. Not necessarily do these pimps and perpetrators kind of groom us, it’s like some of us are so harmed by our parents or our caregivers and how we grow up, that we’re just primed for it. We don’t know it, but it’s like we’re just the perfect target they don’t have to do anything, they say jump and we jump. […] And we go to this party, it’s all grown-ups, its adults. I’m 12 years old. I end up flirting with this man called Sam. He invited me to go to his house to have breakfast. I said yes, I willingly left with him. I don’t know how long it took, five minutes, one hour, half hour, whatever, two seconds. He said take your clothes off and get in the bed, and I did it. And he drags me down the hall and gives me to this guy named Red. So Red was a pimp and there’s so much behind just telling that much of it, but I’ll keep telling more. But that a kid can find themselves in that predicament, you know that’s not the average thing that can happen to a kid, but it’s really easy to happen to a kid. It was so easy. […] I got arrested for prostitution at age 13 my mother had to come to the police station twice. And today I just think what was wrong with people? Why was someone walking me, why weren’t people saying this kid is thirteen years old and by the way this is what happened to her at 12, and by the way she’s been in and out of foster, you know? No one stopped to say something’s happened to this girl, this little girl, let’s help her, let’s figure it out. That never happens. So that was kind of, you know. Today I’m hopeful that that would not get overlooked. […] I went through hell being pimped, but it was nothing like the hell I went through afterwards. And I think I’m a good mom. My kids are okay, they’re better than okay. But I think I would’ve been a fucking great mom if I didn’t have to live through hell. And they didn’t have to. So, maybe if someone paid attention and tried to help me and tried to build me up and push me off to have a better life, maybe I would have. The women I’m meeting today, they definitely have PTSD and they definitely have disassociation and they definitely walk around in survivor mode, and helping them in their crisis situation is major, but it’s after that. I’m in survivor mode. I’m engaging, I’m everything you think when I leave that we had a good session. I walk out the door, I already forgot what the hell we talked about, have no clue. I have a couple of memories of a couple of things. So whatever was supposed to happen there’s no follow through. And the provider gets to think like I want to empower her, she can do it. Okay, I’m gonna give you the bus pass, you can do it, you can do this. And it still doesn’t happen. So that to me is that client needs someone to kind of take them through the motions, the ‘travel companion’. Take them and get it done and model it until she gets strong enough. The more I text and call someone and the more, regardless of what I say to them, then they have opportunity to have a second, five seconds, a minute, however long we stay on the phone, of normalcy, of love, of kindness. Because usually still, women that have just come out of the life are still connected to all kinds of stuff. Pimps are good pleaders, they’re good beggars, they know how to beg, they’re really good at it. But even women who are out of the life, they might still know other women that are still in the life. So their conversation still is one up on the other women. So bitch, this bitch, it’s still negative, it’s not a healthy conversation. Somehow someone’s dissing them or not seeing them for something decent ‘cause that’s what’s going on, and then they get that one text of ‘hey what’s up girl, I was just thinking about you, what you doin’?’ It’s just whatever, that person is now having a moment of somebody that cares about me, someone that doesn’t want anything, you know what I mean? It’s just planning a little bit more of, there’s people that care, there’s people that see me as me.   Narrative provided by Maine Sex Trafficking and Exploitation Network"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Tricia Grant,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,(United States (trafficked from),United States (Slavery location),"When I was 15 I was at a local restaurant in Auburn and I was having a conversation with my friend who is the same age as me and they overheard us talking about money and how important my son was to me and they approached us. It was two men, they approached us and said, ‘hey we overheard you talking about needing to make some money and would you be interested in something we have to offer you?’ So we literally both looked at each other and shrugged and said sure.  So they said go to this apartment. The next day, this brown apartment building in Auburn and meet us there. So we did, and that was the trap. They forced us to do things and they told us that if we told anybody that they would have my son taken away from me because they knew how important he was to me. That was all that they needed to say to me. I had a very rough childhood from the beginning. I was drowned as a baby, somebody tried to drown me as a baby and then my mom took my brother and I, had moved us away from everybody that we knew, and my brother took care of me, he’s only four years older than me, because my mom had to work. And in that time I was sexually abused and I might have been sexually abused before that. But family secrets so I don’t, I don’t really know. […] I didn’t realize what had happened to me for sixteen years. It took sixteen years to even know there was a name for what happened to me. […] Like I had a lot of bruises on me and stuff that people were questioning so I just told them I was dancing, it’s all I told them and nobody questioned it or said anything or nothing. I was a teen mom and I did bring my son to the doctors and I thought that maybe they would pick up on something or see that, or ask questions. And I think that that’s the biggest thing I talk about, was just be interested in teenagers, be interested in learning who they are and what their lives are like, even if they seem on the outside hard and like they have this shell that you know, they don’t want you to interact with them, you know. And we don’t want to live in that brokenness that we’re in, but if nobody engages with us and asks us what’s going on in our lives, that’s the simplest most basic place to start is just wanting to know. […] Police officers are usually the people that are going to see them at their lowest, lowest point. And I think that for them they have the hardest time wanting to do something and looking outside of that box because they’re free, because they are so broken and what can I do? What can I contribute? What can I help? I can’t do anything. You might not be the right person to save them, but you can help them. You can be that first person to care enough to say I want to help you but I don’t know how. So I’m going to point you to this person that I trust and that I know that can help you.   I think in particular with law enforcement, I think a big reason people don’t come forward is because there are police officers that were purchasing us for sex, and for whatever they wanted. There were police officers there so who are you going to go to?   Narrative provided by Maine Sex Trafficking and Exploitation Network"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Byaombe ,2004 (Narrative date) ,War slavery Children Armed conflict,Children Armed conflict,Democratic Republic of Congo,"There is something I can’t forget, even at night. We were fighting at the front against the RCD. We were with the FDD. We captured a child soldier. We tied him up and forced him to smoke marijuana. He lost his mind. We cut off his fingers. It was as if he didn’t feel anything. He was acting like a mad man. Then we opened up his stomach and showed him his intestines. He didn’t feel anything. Finally, we took out his heart and he died. Then we put it all back inside the body, and we tied him to a tree so that his friends would see him. Then, we left. [Did you tell your parents you were joining the armed forces?] Yes, I told them. They told me to go, to help them to cope with what is happening to us. When I arrived at the camp, I went to see the commander, I explained my worries to him. He told me that they would show me how to kill the enemy. When we capture an enemy we must make him suffer. We must take out his eyes, and remove his heart… and cut his ears and his feet. Sometimes we would return from training and there was nothing to eat. There were no medicines to keep up our strength. They gave us marijuana to change our ideas. Also, when we went to the front, many child soldiers were scared. The marijuana gave them strength and courage. Military life is bad. We had few clothes to wear and little food to eat. The commanders slept inside while we slept outside. We slept in the cold of the mountain, with no blankets. When we were sick there were no medicines. At the camp, the girls helped us to cook. But most of them were the ‘wives’ of commanders. I would advise commanders to demobilize child soldiers. Children of my age shouldn’t be soldiers. They should enlist people who are over the age of 18. I really want to tell young civilians that military life is of no interest. When you become a soldier, your soul changes. It is like dying today and being reincarnated into another life. Before I left home, I knew people who had been soldiers. When they lost their tempers, they could easily stab you. Because to them killing someone wasn’t a big deal. They had already killed many people. That is why I want to tell others not to become soldiers. It is better for children to stay at home. There you only learn how to smoke marijuana and then you become weak mentally. I want to tell my friends that they shouldn’t try this life. They should stay at home and pray to God for his help.

Almasie,2018 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,"",Kenya (slavery location),"My past has shaped me but it does not define men. This is my story. I have three children, a boy and two girls. I live in one of the slums in Nairobi. Before I did not know what happened but I was deeply hurt by what happened. I met a pastor who talked about trafficking. He explained about internal trafficking and external trafficking. It was then that I discovered that what had happened to me was traffick. It was in 2009 that I had just had a baby. Now I had three children. A boy and two beautiful girls. It was this time that I really had problems feeding my children, educating them, as I was a single parent. I told my long-time friend that I really wanted a job a well-paid job. Yes I had a job before, I was a cleaner. I used to go to people’s houses, clean their house. Wash their clothes, wash their dishes and get some little pay, but it was not enough. So my long-time friend agreed that she would help me. That’s why I went to look for work that day with my friend. Well we travelled and we reached [where we were going] at night. It was very dark, I could not say exactly where. We just found ourselves in front of a big house and an interview was done to me. I passed the interview as I was a cleaner I knew my work very well. So the lady, my longtime friend left me there because I had passed the interview, and she said she’ll be back later.  I was taken to another room where I met other girls. Most of the girls were very young. Some even looked like they could be my daughters. I never understood what was taking place. Men were coming in, mostly white men and Arabs. They could come in anytime, they could pick anybody they want, they used you. You had to do whatever they told you to do, you had no choice. I thought about my children. I prayed day in day out that one day I’ll leave this place. I stayed in this house for six months. I cannot tell anybody. I cannot tell my relatives. I cannot tell my children. That all I wanted to look for was money. Money to make my children’s future. But all I have now is HIV. It is in Nairobi where I met a pastor and I was informed about HAART. They have been like a family to me. I just wanted to share my story so that whoever is watching or is listening may never undergo what I underwent and if anyone has ever undergone such, there is HAART for you. You are not alone. HAART is there for you. HAART will listen to you. They will console you. And you will live life. Thank you HAART.   Narrative provided by HAART Kenya"," There are an estimated 328,000 people living in conditions of slavery in Kenya (GSI 2018). Men, women and children are subjected to exploitation amounting to modern slavery in forced labour and sex trafficking.

Maryfe,2015 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery,Dubai (slavery location) Philippines (trafficked from),Hong Kong (slavery location),"I have lived here for the last six years. I have worked as a nanny, a cleaner, a housekeeper, a baby-sitter and a carer for an elderly woman. I am “undocumented”; I do not have a permit to live and work in this country. This is my story.  I come from a poor family in the Philippines. I studied up to high school and then I quit my studies to work as a street seller. I got married very early, when I was 17, and quickly had four children. I needed to support my children and care for my sick father, and my husband was not much help. I learned that if I went abroad, I could earn more money for my children and my family. In 2004 I decided to look for work outside the Philippines.  On 2 October 2004 I went to Hong Kong, having had a video interview with a Hong Kong-based recruitment agency. When I got there I was given two jobs to do by my employer; I had to care for her disabled child in one house and in the other I had to look after her bedridden father. It was hard work, and my employer was always angry with me. She called me names. She even held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me. One day I had enough and told her that I wanted to break my contract and return home. She got very angry and called the police and told them that I had stolen HK$ 400 from her. They searched my luggage and even strip searched me. I will never forget that. Even though they agreed with me that I hadn’t stolen anything the police told me that I would have to leave Hong Kong as I had broken my contract. So, scared from this experience, I went back to the Philippines and started selling in the market again. But I made little money and my children were growing up; it is hard as a mother to see your children in need. So I decided I had to go abroad again. On 9 March 2006 I went to Dubai to work as a nanny. The work was tough. I was on call most of the time. I only slept four hours a night as I would have to accompany my employer and her child out until late at night. The salary was low and I didn’t have a day off. In August 2008 the family I was working for came to this country on holiday and brought me with them. Outside the hotel one day I got talking to a Filipina who told me that she would help me run away from my employer. That night I couldn’t sleep. I weighed up my duty as a mother to provide my children with a better life against the fact that it would be many years before I could see my children again. That night I called my family and told them I would not see them any more for many years. It was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made. I miss my children every day. I have had a few jobs since then in this country. I have worked with a family looking after their three children and even though I loved the children, I found it hard to work there. I worked 12 hours a day for five and half days a week. My employer and I argued constantly. She wanted me to come with them on their holidays in another country so that I could look after the children. She didn’t understand that I did not have papers, I can’t leave this country and I can’t risk getting caught. I got acute hypertension. But I felt that I couldn’t leave the job because I needed the money. Finally it got too much and I quit. For one month I was without steady work and I worried constantly about money. My children and my extended family rely on the money that I send them from here. Everyone at home thinks that because I am working in this country that I should be able to send them back lots of money. They don’t know how expensive it is here, and how good work is difficult to find. Then, four years ago I found work with a family as a nanny and housekeeper, and this is where I am working today. I also work part-time during the evenings and weekends cleaning houses and looking after an elderly woman. I am happy at work, but I miss my children and family.  I worry too about my health. I have chronic hypertension and am on daily medication. I have regular appointments with the doctor through a special scheme set up by the public hospital here. My doctor writes on the prescription how much I can afford to pay – when I first started going I was told to pay 5 dollars, then they changed it to 10 dollars, and now I have been told to pay 20 dollars. I don’t know why it has increased, no one has explained this to me. Recently I had an agonizing pain in my tooth and I didn’t know what to do. I have never been to the dentist in all the years I have been in this city. It is too expensive. I don’t have health insurance, and every time I need medical treatment I worry that I will not be able to afford to pay the bill. When I first arrived here I shared a small studio apartment with three other women and paid a share of the rent to the one woman who had a permit and was able to rent the apartment. Now I live with my boyfriend who is also a migrant but who has papers, and I pay him for the rent, food, internet and other expenses.  It is difficult living without papers. I feel scared every time I see the police, even if it is only the transport inspectors. When I first came here I thought that they could just catch you as you were walking on the street and send you back to your country. But now I know that they will only catch you if you get in trouble. So every month I buy a transport ticket, and make sure that I don’t get in trouble with the police. I never fight with anyone because I don’t want them to call the police. A few years ago my friend was suddenly dismissed by her employer without any notice. When she went to her employer to ask for her remaining salary and a reasonable notice period she was threatened by her employer’s husband that he would call the police and tell them that she didn’t have papers. We all advised her to just keep quiet and look for another job. What would she gain by fighting or trying to get an expensive lawyer through the trade union? It is not worth it to get into trouble when you are undocumented. You shouldn’t draw attention to yourself. This is the reality of my life.   Narrative provided by United Nations Human Rights report ‘Behind Closed Doors: Protecting and promoting the human rights of migrant domestic workers in an irregular situation’"," Today women represent around half of the total population of international migrants worldwide. They move, more and more, as independent workers, usually to more developed countries in search of a better life for themselves and for their families. Reproducing patterns of gender inequality, at destination they tend to find work in traditionally female-dominated occupations such as domestic work. Their vulnerabilities are often linked to precarious recruitment processes (including passport and contract substitution as well as charging of excessive fees), the absence of adapted assistance and protection mechanisms, the social and cultural isolation they can face at the destination due to language and cultural differences, lack of advance and accurate information on terms and conditions of employment, absence of labour law coverage and/or enforcement in the country of destination, and restrictions on freedom of movement and association, among other things. Maryfe migrated from the Philippines to Hong Kong in the hopes of earning more money abroad to support her children. Maryfe took a job caring for her employer’s disabled child and bedridden father. She was subjected to violence and threats daily and eventually broke her contract to return to the Philippines. However, still needing to provide for her children, Maryfe travelled abroad again, this time to Dubai, taking a job as a nanny. Maryfe was forced to work long hours with little sleep and no time off. When the family she worked for moved to a different country she was forced to go with them. Though Maryfe was able to escape her employment, she is now stuck undocumented in a foreign country.  "
Amani,2018 (Narrative date) ,Children Forced marriage,Kenya (trafficked from) Forced marriage,Kenya (slavery location),"My past has shaped me, but it does not define me. This is my story. I was born in a polygamy family. My father had three wives. My mother was the third one. During that time my father told me that he was not my real father, but I never asked my mum who is my real father. Since that time, I started suffering. My father used to threaten me in front of my sisters and siblings. Then my sisters and brothers, they started to hurt me because they were saying who is your father? I stayed with them, until when I was 11 years old they forced me through FGM, but I refused. They wanted me to get married, I refused also. It was during the night my father and my mum were not at home, four men came and they took me away. I cried but they were strong. They took me to a market, to a bus station. They told me to stand there as I saw them look for a car. I saw a car which was written World Vision, the people who were in that car were helping to rescue me. Then I went with them to the organization and I stayed with them. After two years my family they came and they asked forgiveness from the manager, the owners of the organisation and said that they would take me to school and everything they were doing in the past they would not do it, but I refused to go with them, but the World Vision told me to go. I stay with them for about two weeks and the same thing happened again. I ran away from home, I went to stay with my uncle for about two months. His wife always was not on my side, she said that you go back to your parents. Then I went to stay with my step brother who was, he was my step brother and was living in another place. Actually I’ve stayed with all my relatives. I went and stayed again with my sister. During that time my father was the one who paid the school feeds so it was considering this money which was to be paid for my school fees. Around August 2015, I decided to escape from home because they were abusing me for many things. So from that time I decided just to go. If I get help okay, if I die it’s okay. Since I came to Nairobi because I had my cousin who is living at Nairobi. He took me to equity bar, we went there and explained everything to the senior manager and that lady said she is going to bring me to HAART Kenya. Then after there I went to a school, so I’m waiting to go to school this year, September. HAART is good, it’s a good home, a supportive environment, they have everything, security, food, education, everything. And it’s a peaceful home. I hope to succeed and to help others, people outside who are suffering.   Narrative provided by HAART Kenya"," There are an estimated 328,000 people living in conditions of slavery in Kenya (GSI 2018). While Kenya has committed to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030 in line with target 5.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, 23% of Kenyan girls are still married before their 18th birthday. According to UNICEF, Kenya has the 20th highest absolute number of child brides in the world. Forced child marriage is driven by gender inequality with the belief that girls are inferior to boys. It is exacerbated by poverty, natural disasters and cultural traditions such as female genital mutilation and Samburu whereby a close family relative will approach a girl’s parents with red Samburu beads and place the necklace around the girl’s neck as a form of engagement.  Amani was 11 years old when her parents told her she must undergo female genital mutilation and get married. After refusing, one night four men came and took her away to a market. Luckily, World Vision were able to rescue Amani from her situation, however, when she returned to her parents two years later, the same thing happened again. Amani ran away to Nairobi, and there was taken in by HAART Kenya."
Beli,2016 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation Children,Nepal (trafficked from) Children,India (slavery location),"After the brothel owners beat me, they sent me in to my room. The men did many things to me there. The madams even beat me when I came out of the room. They beat me a lot. I ended up in the brothel because 2 women in Nepal befriended me and took me to watch a movie. When I asked for a drink of water, they mixed some kind of drug in the water. Then I was taken to Bombay and I was sold to the brothel owners. I had many welts on my body from being beaten. It used to hurt, they did not feed me well. In the morning I got rice and, in the evening, they used to give me rotten rice that they had gotten outside the brothel. I would wake up around 1 o clock then I’d brush my teeth and by the time I had finished eating it would be 3 o clock. Then I would put on my makeup and wait. They used to lock us up with a huge padlock on the main door. It had steel all around. We were never allowed out on the street to get anything, the madams had everything brought in to us.   Narrative provided by ACRATH"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

Emmanuel,2016 (Narrative date),Forced labour Children,Children,Ghana (slavery location),My name is Emmanuel. I was never happy when I was a slave. I was very upset when I heard that my mother had sold me for just 40 Cedis (£25). The fog makes it difficult to see tree stumps and canoes and children can poke their eyes out on the stumps.   Narrative provided by ACRATH," There are an estimated 133,000 people living in modern slavery in Ghana (GSI 2018). Ghana remains a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, artisanal gold mining, quarrying, herding, and agriculture, including cocoa. Research focused on the fishing industry on Lake Volta indicated that more than half of the children working on and around the lake were born in other communities and many of these children are subjected to forced labor; not allowed to attend school; given inadequate housing and clothing; and are controlled by fishermen through intimidation, violence, and limiting access to food. Boys as young as five years old are forced to work in hazardous conditions, including deep diving, and many suffer waterborne infections. A study of the prevalence of child trafficking in selected communities in the Volta and Central Regions indicated that children from nearly one-third of the 1,621 households surveyed had been subjected to trafficking, primarily in fishing and domestic servitude.  Emmanuel was sold by his mother to work fishing on Lake Volta, Ghana."

Anita D,2010 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Nepal (trafficked from),India (slavery location),"I was taken to this place where I expected to do maid service but as soon as I walked in, I saw a bunch a men sitting around and there were these ladies wearing this really garish and loud makeup. I turned to the lady who had brought me there and I said, ‘what is this place?’ I started to get really scared. I was taken into a room and told what I had to do. I told them I can’t do that. Where I was from in Nepal, girls were kept separate from boys, I had never even spoken to a boy much less a man. I screamed. I can’t do that job, but six women grabbed my arms and legs and held me down on a bed. I screamed and fought, I really didn’t understand what was happening until two men came into the room and raped me. They yelled at me stop crying, it’s not going to help, that nothing I could do was going to stop it. It was one of the darkest moments of my entire life. I just cried and cried. I was 19 years old and didn’t know anything of this. But unfortunately, that was just the beginning. This was not a life that I wanted. I fought them with all the strength and stubbornness that I had, and when they attacked me, I attacked back. But because of it, I was regularly tortured. For 3 years they locked me in a room and never let me out. There was no way of escape. For 3 years I never saw the sun or stars. As many as 40 men came to me every day. With no hope I finally accepted it, this was my life now. I always feared the men, how is this man going to treat me? Is he going to abuse me? About 90% of them did. And they smelled so bad. I started drinking heavily just to endure each day. In your heart and in your mind it’s about survival. Even in the brothels, status and perception become important. So, after years of abuse as one of the girls I climbed to the position of madam simply to improve my life. I really didn’t think about the role I was going to then play in the problem. Once I became a madam, I had three kids. Unfortunately, my first died at 10 months old, but my second and third child, they gave me something to live for. Looking after them gave me hope that maybe I could give them a life I could never have. The things that I have seen are unimaginable, I’m ashamed to even speak of them. There was one time when two new girls were brought to our brothel. They had only been there about three days and were in the process of being broken in when there was a police raid. Those two girls were put into a hidden room to keep them from being found by the police, but we didn’t realise there was some rope left in the room. And when we came back, we found the girls had hung themselves. The two girls were sisters. That really affected me. They were so badly tortured. There wasn’t a spot on their hands that didn’t have cigarette burns they obviously felt the better choice was death. 90% of the girls brought to the brothels are kidnapped and taken completely against their will and the other 10% like me were tricked into thinking they would have a legitimate job. In our brothel there were 12-year olds and 13-year olds, 15-years old, 20-years old, every age. Children in brothels, if it’s a girl, they’re in danger. They can be abused at any age. That’s why I had to get my children out. Especially my daughter. So, it was about the time I was looking for a safe place my kids that I found out about the church in the red light district. That’s where I first heard about Jesus. Each time I visited the church I heard more about him. The rescue did take in my children and these people started to visit me again and again and care for me. They told me to trust in God. I began to think that if these people can do that then maybe there is a God that does care about me too. So, I gave my life to God and that’s the only thing that got me through that year, There were 12 girls under me at the time. I started closing the brothel every Saturday long enough to take them all to church. Every girl eventually came to know Jesus as saviour. One of them was even healed of a sickness she had been living with for 10 years. On the day that we planned to leave, I could barely contain my excitement. I was jumping up and down, it seemed almost impossible that I was really leaving this place. The six girls I sent back to Nepal, the other six girls went with me to the rescue centre and my life changed dramatically. But forgiveness and healing, that was a long process. I couldn’t forgive people, especially the lady who had originally betrayed me. I fasted for 40 days for a breakthrough and when that didn’t work, I fasted another 40. It wasn’t until a pastor told me how Jesus, a completely innocent man tortured and hung on a cross said, ‘Father forgive them’, that I was able to let go and forgive. I learned that day that forgiveness was the first step for me to walk in freedom with Jesus. That’s when I really saw God shining through men. I’ve been able to go back in to the red-light district. As I walk in the sadness and depression on the faces of the girls it breaks my heart and I find myself wanting to run up to them and share the hope that I found. Because I was no one special, but God rescued me, and I want to tell them he can rescue them too. When they come out, we see their countenances transformed. At first, they’re heavily depressed and can’t look you in the eye, but now there’ a radiance in their faces and this joy breaks forth. God has provided for my life. I now have this wonderful role of being a mother to young daughters of girls who still have to work in the brothels. They come to the rescue centre and I come alongside them. I love them and I give them shelter and good and all the things they lack in the brothels.     Narrative produced and owned by Jyra Films in association with SOS International "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day there were nearly 8 million people living in modern slavery in India.

There was a day I got called on the phone about someone who wanted to come and the guy that came into the room pretended that he was going to do all the same things that everyone else did. But he ended up being an undercover police officer and he arrested me, and took me to the Cook County police department and he questioned me. I was only 14 going on 15 and I told him how old I was. He knew that I ran away because I told him I did, because I wanted to go back home. I don’t want what happened to me to happen to anybody else. Anybody could pick you up. And it all happens really quickly. And I think a lot of the people that do the human trafficking stuff, have less of a chance of getting caught in a smaller community is what they’re thinking.   Narrative produced by Braking Traffik"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Sara B,2016 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"Growing up I was raised in a single parent household in a loving home and was surrounded by friends and family. I moved around a lot. I pretty much just stuck to myself. When I was 13 my mom met my stepdad. That was a big change for me and my mom was always working. My dad would come home and he was just very controlling and an alcoholic and verbally abusive. I believed that I wasn’t worth anything and I was just better left out of the picture. I went to high school, got involved with the wrong crowd, the ones that were doing the drugs and their parents did drugs and got involved with sneaking out. After graduating high school I was introduced to coke for the first time. I walked out of the room and said that I didn’t need that, I didn’t want that. I still kept drinking with them and as the night went on and it was presented to me I eventually gave in. my mom had kicked me out several times and I actually ended up staying in my car for a week. My drug addiction became worse and the alcohol, I was not just going out on the weekends, it was every day of the week. My life was out of control and I didn’t see it myself but everyone around me had told me to get help. At the time I had friends that were strippers and, to me it looked glamorous. They made it look like they were making a bunch of money and men wanted to be with them. I knew that was something that I wanted to do. I worked with the stripping not very long until I actually found that there was an escort service here in Quad City that I could get a hold of. Working for the escorting business I knew I’d make a lot more money and it’d be easier. She also had told me that I’d be going by another name and this would be a nickname that no one else knew me by. I also was told to slip the money under the door. She had someone that would take the money from me. I remember after a week I had wanted to quit and I wanted to get out. But because I was renting from her I didn’t think that there was any way that I was going to be able to get out of this. I would meet clients at hotels and their house and sometimes truck stops. Because of the drugs and alcohol I was so numb, but at the same time I was always afraid, and I felt like I was living two different lives, two different identities. I did this for over a year and dealt with feelings of shame and guilt and depression and wanting to get out. I didn’t want my family to know about it. It wasn’t until I got my second DUI. I needed a ride home and had gotten a ride from a guy across the street and he took me to a drug house where I was raped by multiple men. I decided that I couldn’t do it anymore. One of the police officers told me that I needed to get help otherwise they were going to see me dead in a ditch like they’d seen many times with other girls. It’s really important who you surround yourself with now and I never reached out to any of my mentors or teachers or even family because I felt like they couldn’t relate or they didn’t know what they were talking about. And I think many times that these people are truly in your life and they do care and if it’s someone that you trust it’s really important to talk to someone. Because you don’t have to make those bad decisions or go down that road.   Narrative produced by Braking Traffik  "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Christi,2016 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,United States (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"As a young child I had a really good life. I was very involved with church, I was a good student, I had a lot of friends. I guess the only bad thing was when I was 6 years old my parents got divorced. When I was 14 years old I started smoking marijuana just here and there and experimenting with that. When I was 16 I was at a party and there was a lot drugs and alcohol there. I had drunk a lot. The next thing I remember is waking up in a park and my pants were off and I was left just lying in the park. After that I didn’t really know how to feel, how to act, what to do, I didn’t know who to talk to about it. But all I did was just black people out I didn’t let them in. Later that year I started dating a boy from school, he was a marijuana dealer and quickly after began selling cocaine and that’s when everything really spiralled out of control. I quit going to school, I moved out of my house, I was just on cocaine every day all day. Our relationship became very abuse physically, emotionally. Shortly after breaking up with him my mom stepped in and she finally committed me to rehab. I was 18 then. While I was in rehab I met a girl there. So when we got out of rehab I moved in with her. I didn’t think my life could get any worse. I went from cocaine to crack cocaine. I had met another man. For a while there we were just going to Chicago and Rockford and picking drugs up and bringing them back. After a couple of times of doing that, we were in Chicago and basically he said this time to get them you have to prostitute yourself and this is what’s gonna happen, we’re gonna go to a hotel and this is what you’re gonna do. I met another man and he took me to Memphis, Tennessee and when we got there I quickly realised what was gonna happen again. I feel like it was more the drugs than anything holding me there. But it was also him because he knew that had that power over me. And if I didn’t work that day and I didn’t go out and prostitute myself I didn’t have any. I was just taken advantage of every day, and I was raped, I was beaten, I was stole from. I was just stripped of everything physically and emotionally. I remember walking down the street one day and a cop pulled over. And you could obviously tell by looking at me that I’m not okay, there’s something going on, and he just said are you ok. And I said yeah I’m fine. Because I was just so scared, I didn’t want to go back to a police station. I just remember after he pulled away I just like, I just wanted him so badly to come back and  I couldn’t, I couldn’t change that and a part of me wanted to just go back so bad. But where was I gonna go, who was I gonna call? And who was gonna come get me because who really cared? So I was stuck in a little jail in Arkansas. That was my bottom that was when I just realised like I cannot live like this anymore. I felt like I was slowly dying. I called my mom and she said you know she’d be there to get me. I’ve been clean since October 2009 and that was it. I just never looked back. My mom is a wonderful lady. When I got home it was just open arms and love and there was really no reconciling to do. When you hit those teen years, no one likes their parents, they’re all crazy, they’re old, they don’t understand like. But you’re parents gonna be your best friend and they’re the one whose gonna be there forever, and it’s just so important to to not follow in your friends and what they do. And do what you think is right. If I could go back there are so many things. I never would have smoked that first joint and I would never have popped that first pill because I really, that is what took me to this life. It could happen to anyone. I mean you hear all these crazy stories but that’s never gonna be you, and it could be.   Narrative produced by Braking Traffik  "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Samantha,2013 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Children,United States (trafficked from) Children,United States (slavery location),"They held me in a house over by McKinley Park. And er I slept in the back room, there was bars on the windows, I slept on a dirty mattress. I was not allowed to leave unless they took me out and when they took me out they would make the deal, and somehow they made the deal to where the person would have to bring me back to where they picked me up. And it always worked. They always brought me back. My name is Samantha, at age 14 I ran away from home the first time and my parents decided to put me into in-patient counselling, maybe it would help. Met up with a girl that I had known in foster care, we leave one day and she takes me to her sister who lives in Oklahoma City and she is involved in the Cripps gang and they leave me with them. And that’s how it started. These people control every move you make, they control your body, they control who has access to your body. They literally control whether you eat, what you drink, where you sleep, if you get to take a shower, they control everything. That’s the difference between prostitution and being prostituted, there’s no choice. The very first time it happened I was taken to Clossen Motel and I can remember what he looks like, I can remember everything about him. And he said ‘you’re so young, why are you doing this’ and my thought was my God I’m not doing this, you know you bought me, you bought me. How am I doing this? They put me in a car and I can remember everything about it.it was a blue car, the guy reaches over and puts his hand on my leg. And during that moment I knew he was going to kill me. Everything within me I could feel it. We had pulled up to a stop light and I reached down and grabbed the handle when he took off and I jumped out. Because he turned right, and I took off running and that was how I was able to get away. My first thoughts when I was able to get away was how was I going to stay away, how was I gonna take care of myself. What was I going to do to survive? After living on the streets for a while I was picked up by this man and taken over by frontier city and he got me a motel room and he said I don’t want anything from you, I’m just going to give you a place to stay, but here’s a phone number that I want you to call. They call a lady that had a brothel here in the city and tried to get me into the brothel. But when I talked to her she said ‘how old are you?’ I said I’m seventeen. She said ‘I’m not taking you you’re too young’. Because they did leave me alone during the day, at one point I was just like I’m tired and I’m ready to just have this all over with, I’m ready for it to be over with. I called the guy that I had been dating before, when I was in foster care, and he came and picked me up and took me to the HS (Department of Human Services). And they didn’t do anything. They didn’t do anything. And I aged out. I graduated high school, miraculously, I don’t know how. I graduated high school and erm started you know trying to make a life. I do remember at one point a DHS worker came into the house and I was in the NCIC system at that time, she just looked at me and didn’t even ask me any questions. Looking the way I looked, you would think that she would stop and ask questions but she just looked at me and went on. So that could’ve been the end of it right there but it wasn’t. If you were to go to the police, what are they gonna say? Oh you’re a runaway for one thing, why did you run away? That doesn’t matter. That doesn’t matter one bit. What’s happened to you while you ran away? That doesn’t matter. That doesn’t matter one bit. You’re just a runaway. I was working as a domestic violence case manager and went to a seminar on human trafficking for OATH and when I was sitting there listening to this girl tell her story, I about fell out of my chair. Literally because she was telling my story. Then you realise you know, it’s real, it’s real. It wasn’t me. I started crying I had to get up and leave because I knew I was going to be ok. From that point on I knew I was gonna be ok. Literally that day changed my life. If anything can change anything, that day changed my life. If it wasn’t for those programmes and those organizations, I wouldn’t be where I’m at now. I know that. And I wouldn’t be healed. But I’m healing. I’m hopeful that there’s gonna be a girl someday that I’m gonna make a difference for. That I’m gonna be, ok I helped her, and she’s gonna go that girl helped me, I’m gonna help somebody else. And then that girl’s gonna help somebody else.  "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018). Sex trafficking exists throughout the country.

He put some drugs in my food and I fell unconscious and then he took me to Delhi and sold me to a brothel. People ask us if we are here by choice. But from the beginning our owners beat and intimidate us. Warning that if we say it’s by force they will use the machine to cut us into pieces. So we have to say we are here willingly.

Taylor,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation,"",United States (slavery location),"A few months after my seventeenth birthday I found myself trying to survive on the streets. This is my story. When I was a kid I dreamed of being like prom queen or I don’t know, cheerleading captain, girly little things. I just wanted to be loved. I wanted to be picked by the cute boy that you have a crush on. I just wanted to be special to somebody else. Trafficking victims, they can come from any walk of life. I don’t care if they’re from a nurturing home with like you know a great mom and dad, real good support system. Any girl can be trafficked if she feels like she’s got something missing on the inside. When I met my trafficker, he promised me that we would be taken care of, that I would always have food, I would always have a place to sleep. He was gonna love me, I had a home. We were like a family, it made it all seem like a dream come true, you know. He wasn’t, well it wasn’t what I thought it was gonna be between him and me. He started beating me. He used to promise that I would never have to walk the track and I started walking the track, I started going to truck stops. He told me what to wear, how to dress, how to do my hair. He had completely control over everything and it was just pretty much anything he said is what I did. My mom saw my Backpage ad. It was just mind-blowing. I was like my mom turned in my Backpage ad, huh? And they were like yeah she did, she tipped us of. My mom was doing for me what I couldn’t do for myself. She knew I would never leave that man. Looking back it was the best thing that ever happened. Because I would still be down in those streets. End Slavery came in to my life when I was in a facility down here in Nashville. My therapist and I just had an instant bond and I started telling her everything. And she was like I’m going to introduce you to somebody. And then Sheila came and met me. It was awesome she was just so loving, and she was like I’ve got a company and you’re gonna love us and we love you, and she meant it.  At first, I used to really own the tattoo, I used to be like I love this tattoo. And then I got in to treatment and I started realising I was literally branded against my will. Like a piece of property, I wasn’t my own person anymore. I was his. Because it’s very easy to be able to be like I’m not dirty anymore, you’re not a part of me anymore, until you realise, they’re literally a part of you across your neck. That’s not something you can ignore, it’s not something you can cover up easily. Sheila said, we can get that off of you. And I went to my first session and I remember feeling so independent for the first time, like completely separated from him. And I remember feeling like so excited because I was just like, I’m my own person now, you know. It just makes it that much more real. It just goes right along with my healing process, you know it takes a long time. And so does getting a tattoo removed.   Narrative provided by End Slavery Tennessee"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Seng Moon,2019 (Narrative date),Forced marriage,Myanmar (trafficked from),China (slavery location),"When I woke up my hands were tied behind my back. I cried and shouted and asked for help. [My sister-in-law told me] ‘Now you have to get married to a Chinese man’. I wore jeans and a red blouse – they gave it to me to wear. The tied me with a red ribbon. No one ever asked me if I wanted to be married. […] My sister-in-law left me at the home. When I entered the home, the family members talked to me, but I didn’t know what they were saying. The family took me to a room. In that room I was tied up again. The man tied me up. They locked the door—for one or two months. When it was time for meals, they sent meals in. I was crying… Each time when the Chinese man brought me meals, he raped me. There was a window, but the window was black, so I didn’t know whether it was day or night. Whenever he brought the meal, he said ‘have the meal’. I said, ‘When you leave the meal I will eat it’. But he usually raped me before I had the meal. After two months, they dragged me out of the room. The father of the Chinese man said, “Here is your husband. Now you are a married couple. Be nice to each other and build a happy family”.  […] He just kept saying, ‘I bought you. You are my wife – I bought you’. They knew I didn’t have any willingness to stay – that’s why they locked me in a room. The first time I didn’t accept – I tried to escape. We were fighting each other in the room so many times, but after two or three months I thought ‘This is useless’, so I stopped fighting. […] I’m afraid. If the police hear my story, they will try to find the Chinese family - and the Chinese family will try to find me. I’m afraid they will find me. People might think that people trafficked to China have behaved in ways that are not good and that’s why they were trafficked. […] My first husband, I tried to – really tried to – explain to him what happened. But he didn’t accept it and we weren’t happy, so we divorced. He didn’t believe me.   Narrative provided by Human Rights Watch in their report “Give Us a Baby and We’ll Let You Go”: Trafficking of Kachin “Brides” from Myanmar to China"," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day in 2016 there were over 3.8 million people living in conditions of modern slavery in China. Women and girls from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa are trafficked in to forced marriage in the country for fees of up to £30,000. The gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them.  Seng Moon’s family fled fighting in Myanmar’s Kachin State in 2011 and wound up struggling to survive in a camp for internally displaced people. In 2014 when Seng Moon was 16 and attending fifth grade, her sister in law said she knew of a job as a cook in China’s neighbouring Yunnan province. Seng Moon did not want to go but the promised wage was far more than she could make in the IDP camp. In the car, Seng Moon’s sister-in-law gave her something she said prevented car sickness. Seng Moon fell asleep immediately and when she woke up, she was in China. She was forced to marry a Chinese man and seven months later was pregnant. After her son was born, Seng Moon asked to go home, her husband told her no one would stop her, but she couldn’t take her child. Over two years after being trafficked to China, Seng Moon met a Kachin woman in the market who gave her 1000 yuan to help her return to Myanmar with her son."

[But] no official person like here… No documents, because I was from Myanmar and I didn’t have an ID card. So, there was no documentation for our marriage. […] Four days later we arrived in Fugan. …Then I was locked up in the room. I was not allowed to use the phone. For a week I cried. I ate nothing. All I could do was pray. After that I realized that I had no way to choose anymore…I was there for four years […] After a week they let me wander around. The problem was, in the village, they’d told everyone if I tried to run away, the villagers should call them. They gave them the phone number to call. In the downtown, there was only a bus station, so if anyone saw me on a bus, they would contact the family. There was no escape. […] Because the first child was a boy, they treated us very well. [Then Nang Shayi gave birth to a girl, her in-laws told her she could no stay in China after having two children, and could not obtain documentation for her children unless she was sterilized] After the operation the Chinese man’s mother totally changed. She often yelled at me. They discriminated between the boy and the girl – even giving snacks. Especially his mother. Sometimes she yelled at me: “You Myanmar people are bullshit and son of a bitch! Because you are just sex workers and worthless persons!” She used all kinds of bad words. But the worst was the discrimination between the children. The husband was nice to me, but the problem was his mother. Sometimes she would physically attack me. I couldn’t stand such conditions any longer. [Nang Shayi took her daughter and ran, making it to Myanmar] I’m still young but I can’t have any more babies. For a woman, this looks like there is no hope for me.     Narrative provided by Human Rights Watch in their report “Give Us a Baby and We’ll Let You Go”: Trafficking of Kachin “Brides” from Myanmar to China  "," The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day in 2016 there were over 3.8 million people living in conditions of modern slavery in China. Women and girls from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa are trafficked in to forced marriage in the country for fees of up to £30,000. The gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides.

Fainness states that while in Malawi everything was fine and there were ‘no red flags’. However, once she was taken to the US everything changed. Fainness was forced to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week and was paid less than 50 cents an hour.

Men and women migrate from South and Southeast Asia, Egypt, the Middle East, and increasingly throughout Africa to work in Kuwait, predominantly in the domestic service, construction, hospitality, and sanitation sectors. The vast majority of migrant workers arrive voluntarily; however, upon arrival some sponsors subject migrants to forced labour, including through non-payment of wages, protracted working hours without rest, deprivation of food, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and restrictions on movement, such as confinement to the workplace and the withholding of passports. Many of the migrant workers arriving in Kuwait have paid exorbitant fees to labour recruiters in their home countries or are coerced into paying labour broker fees in Kuwait which, according to Kuwaiti law, should be paid by the employer—a practice making workers highly vulnerable to forced labour, including debt bondage. To a lesser extent, migrant women are also subjected to forced prostitution.  Prudence was offered a teaching job in Kuwait, making twice as much as she was making in Uganda. However, upon arrival her passport was confiscated and she was told to start cleaning. Prudence was subjected to verbal abuse daily, with other women working there suffering physical abuse. Though she wanted to leave, her employers told her she had to finish her contract. A contract she had not signed. Prudence’s luck changed one day when the family she worked with invited some friends to dinner who brought their own maid, also a Ugandan woman. Prudence told this woman about her abuse and was encouraged to get out. One morning while the family was sleeping, Prudence quietly left the house."

Sex trafficking exists throughout the country. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Catie was 18 years old when she moved from Colorado to San Francisco and met a man at a nightclub. She began a relationship with this man that soon became coercive and manipulative.

I wanted to save money to send my brother to school. I was 22 years old when I applied at the bar. The manager kept forcing me to dance and entertain customers. Others took me straight to their hotel and made me do things. I was treated as a slave. I felt… sad, scared, ashamed. I got strength from my brother. I don’t want him to go through what I have been through. I always think of my brother, that this is for him, so he could graduate, that he won’t experience the things I’ve experienced. I was able to leave with the help of the police. Along with them were social workers, who rescued and brought us to a safe place. IJM helped me a lot. They provided me a safe place where I can be happy, move forward, have new hope and a better life, and study. I am studying business administration.

I saw this as an opportunity. Sometimes the husband would tell me: Marcela, go up to your room, it’s late, and you’ve worked enough. But my employer would never tell me this. Even though I did what I thought was a great job, she was never happy and would complain. It was never good enough. Sometimes she came back from work and started screaming at me and the children if she didn’t like something. I knew nothing about the country, I could not speak a word of the language. I was obliged to accept the conditions, because I could not find other work. I was scared of the police, because I didn’t have papers. My employer would tell me not to open the door to anyone because I was working illegally. For me today its good. I was lucky to get help. I know that for some girls it’s not like that. I’m more relaxed. I pay my taxes and everything. I’m paid, and I’m going to get a pension; so everything is good for me.  "," Today women represent around half of the total population of international migrants worldwide. They move, more and more, as independent workers, usually to more developed countries in search of a better life for themselves and for their families. Reproducing patterns of gender inequality, at destination they tend to find work in traditionally female-dominated occupations such as domestic work. Their vulnerabilities are often linked to precarious recruitment processes (including passport and contract substitution as well as charging of excessive fees), the absence of adapted assistance and protection mechanisms, the social and cultural isolation they can face at the destination due to language and cultural differences, lack of advance and accurate information on terms and conditions of employment, absence of labour law coverage and/or enforcement in the country of destination, and restrictions on freedom of movement and association, among other things. In May 2006 at the age of 52 Marcela B travelled to visit her daughter who was an irregular migrant worker to see her new grandchild. Travelling on a tourist visa she was able to stay for 3 months but unable to work. However, while there Marcela’s daughter faced the prospect of losing her job so Marcela agreed to step in and become a live-in domestic worker. For three years Marcela worked seven days a week, taking care of two small children as well as shopping, cooking, cleaning and ironing. She was unable to take time off she was ill and without papers felt she had little option but to keep on working. In 2009 Marcela was able to obtain a temporary residence permit and nor works 8 hours a day with regular breaks and time off."
Katya (Narrative 1),2007 (Narrative date) ,Sexual exploitation,Ukraine (trafficked from),United States (slavery location),"This is my story. I did not work as a maid, or on a farm. I was not made to be a prostitute. I came from another country. But I will try to speak for all survivors of trafficking, no matter what they were made to do or where they are from. Because our desire is a universal one—the desire for freedom. Please call me Katya. I cannot use my real name today and I am also in disguise because I fear that my captors will recognize me and place my life and that of my family in danger. In Fall 2003 I was a university student in Ukraine. I found out about a summer program that would allow me to work in the United States and study English. I was very excited. I applied for the program and obtained a student visa. I found out that I would be working as a waitress in Virginia Beach. In May 2004 I traveled to the United States. I flew from Kiev to Washington D.C. When I landed, I was surprised to see Michael Aronov and Alex Maksimenko, people I knew from Ukraine, at the airport in Washington D.C. They told me that I would no longer be going to Virginia but not to worry because they had worked things out and I would be going to Detroit. They gave me a bus ticket to Detroit. When the bus arrived in Detroit I saw Michael, Alex, and another Ukranian man that I knew, Veniamin Gonikman waiting for me. Once I got off the bus in Detroit, everything changed. They took me to a hotel and took all of my identity documents from me. They told me that they needed them in order to get a state identification card for me. They told me that I owed them $12,000 for travel to the United States and $10,000 for the identification document, and that I only had a short time to pay them off. I quickly learned how I would have to pay it off. They told me I was going to have to work at a strip club called Cheetah’s. They forced me to work six days a week for twelve hours a day. I could not refuse to go to work or I would be beaten. I had to hand over all of my money to Michael and Alex. I was often yelled at for not making enough money or had a gun put to my face. Every week I handed over around $3000–$4000 to Alex and Michael. I was their slave. My captors kept me in an apartment with one of the other girls. I was never allowed out of the apartment by myself. I was driven to work by Michael or Alex (sometimes both) every day, except when they were on vacation. Then, they hired a car service for us. There was no phone in our apartment. Sometimes I was forced to call home to talk to my mom and tell her I was okay. Someone was always listening in on the calls so I could not tell her the truth, but I think she could tell by my voice that I was in trouble. I never felt safe, between the other girl and I we only had one key to our apartment. Michael and Alex also had keys. Sometimes they would just come into our apartment without knocking, even if we were in the shower or sleeping. They would also come into our apartment when we weren’t there. I know that they did this, because I found my things moved around. I think they were looking around to make sure we hadn’t been keeping any of the money. The girl I lived with and I were trying to keep some money to escape. Our captors would give us money at the store and we would have to give them any leftover money. To try to keep some money for our escape we would slide some money into candy boxes. Once we got back to our place we hid the money in a hole outside in front of the apartment. My enslavement finally ended when I escaped with the girl that I lived with. I was terrified that Alex and Michael were going to catch us. When we escaped from our apartment we put the stuff we wanted to take with us in garbage bags in case Alex or Michael showed up, that way we could just act like we were taking out the trash. We escaped with the help from someone who believed us. The other girl confided in a man who came to the strip club regularly and who she felt she could trust. When he found out what happened, he agreed to help us. We were scared but went with him to ICE because they were supposed to help escapees. It was intimidating, but we told our story. The agents not only believed us and helped us, but they went that night and rescued two other women that had also been enslaved. They arrested Alex and Michael before they could run away or hide the evidence. Once they were arrested, I felt safe for the first time. Since I escaped I have been learning English on my own and working full time. I really want to go back to school and finish my degree in sport medicine, but the money for college is an issue. I am lucky, I escaped and survived being a victim of human trafficking. Many others are victims right now, they need help. Traffickers should not be able to exploit the student visa process. I was aware of human trafficking, I knew about it. I checked the program out and talked to people who had used the same company and come back safely. Still I was [a] victim. Businesses in the United States should not be able to make money off of slaves simply because they have someone else bring them into work. Not only did Alex and Michael make a lot of money by exploiting me, so did the strip club. Finally, when I left Ukraine in May of 2004 and I said good-bye to my mother, I expected to see her again in a few months. Life in the United States is hard without my mother being with me. I never wanted to be here this long, but it is not safe for me to return to Ukraine. I miss my mom, and I worry about her safety since Alex’s dad, Veniamin, is still in Ukraine. If the trafficking law had allowed for my mother to come and live with me in the United States, it would have helped me and protected her. Please help future victims like me, do not let this happen to anyone else. Thank you.","Twenty-year-old 'Katya' was trafficked from the Ukraine to the United States in 2004, and enslaved in a strip club in Detroit. She escaped in February 2005. The escape led to the arrest and conviction of her traffickers. In 2007 she told her story to a U.S. House of Representatives committee, using as assumed name, Katya, for her own protection.

Dominic,2016 (Narrative date) ,Forced labour Children,Children,Ghana (slavery location),"My name is Dominic Kweku. I didn’t realise that my family had sold me into slavery until one day when my slave master told me while taunting me for a mistake I’d made. People should know that diving was the most dangerous part about fishing. Many children die in this work. My friend Monnie died because of diving in the lake. I am happy about being in school and having the opportunity to share my experience with you, so other children in slavery can be liberated.   Narrative provided by ACRATH"," Ghana remains a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, artisanal gold mining, quarrying, herding, and agriculture, including cocoa. Research focused on the fishing industry on Lake Volta indicated that more than half of the children working on and around the lake were born in other communities and many of these children are subjected to forced labor; not allowed to attend school; given inadequate housing and clothing; and are controlled by fishermen through intimidation, violence, and limiting access to food. Boys as young as five years old are forced to work in hazardous conditions, including deep diving, and many suffer waterborne infections. A study of the prevalence of child trafficking in selected communities in the Volta and Central Regions indicated that children from nearly one-third of the 1,621 households surveyed had been subjected to trafficking, primarily in fishing and domestic servitude.  Dominic’s family sold him as a slave to work on Lake Volta in Ghana."

When I was two years old my dad was introduced to crack cocaine and so he began abusing crack cocaine, and at the same time he was also physically abusing my mom. My dad and I had gotten into a really bad argument when I was 14. There was a guy that was living next to my dad at that point and said that me and my best friend could come live with him he was 19 or 20 at the time and we were both 14. We were there for about two weeks, I remember walking into the apartment and looking at you know there's three girls sitting there that were all our age that had already been out on the streets, and it scared me, and so we you know made our way out of that place. So I'm bouncing from one guy's house to another and it was all adult men, allowing us to live with them in return for sexual favours, it was survival sex at that point. The last guy that I ended up living with told me that I can either sell drugs or you can sell yourself and that day they took us to where you can purchase girls. It was horrible. You're dealing with constant harassment or physical abuse, telling me you might as well face it you're just a ho. that's why all I'm doing is using you. Life was it wasn't life. Probably at about four o'clock in the morning, this white truck pulls up we drove off and he grabbed me by my hair and he's saying all these things in my ear and telling me what he's gonna do to me, is gonna kill me. And he had a picture of a little girl in his dashboard and I asked him if it was his daughter and he said yeah, and I said well I'm somebody's daughter. He ended up driving me back to where he picked me up, let me go. A lot of girls, our story ends in that car. I was like I hate this I don't want to live like this anymore, and I wanted to have a normal life. Even though I had pimps and other girls around me saying ‘how are you gonna make money?’ and all this stuff, it was a motivation for me to go show them that I was going to do it anyway, even if they didn't think that I could. I didn't feel like I had anywhere I could go where people actually understood. The first session I had with my therapist she said a year from today your life will be different. Once I was connected with the healing community in the therapeutic community it got better because I had people that could actually put labels on what I was experiencing. People who are trafficking children and women in our community should not be any less at risk of criminal penalty than some guy who's selling drugs. The case act is an answer to my prayers and it's been a long time coming for girls like me and women like me.   Narrative provided courtesy of California Against Slavery"," Sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exists throughout the United States. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage and other forms of coercion to compel adults and children to engage in commercial sex acts against their will. The situations that sex trafficking victims face vary, many victims become romantically involved with someone who then forces them into prostitution. Others are lured with false promises of a job, and some are forced to sell sex by members of their own families. Victims of sex trafficking include both foreign nationals and US citizens, with women making up the majority of those trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2015, the most reported venues/industries for sex trafficking included commercial-front brothels, hotel/motel-based trafficking, online advertisements with unknown locations, residential brothels, and street-based sex trafficking. Leah was left an abusive household and was bouncing from house to house, providing sexual services for accommodation when she was trafficked. The final man Leah lived with told her she either had to sell drugs or sell herself in order to stay with him. "
Bennu,2019 (Narrative date),Domestic slavery Forced marriage Narrative,Myanmar (trafficked from) Forced marriage,China (slavery location),"","There are an estimated 3.8 million people living in conditions of modern slavery in Chian (GSI 2018). Women and girls from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa are trafficked in to forced marriage in the country for fees of up to £30,000. The gender imbalance caused by the One Child Policy and the cultural preference for male children, has caused a shortage of women which has led to the trafficking of women to be sold as brides. As a result many women find themselves either deceived by promises of employment, sold or abducted and forced into marrying Chinese men who have paid for them. Kachin people are an ethnic minority who are predominantly Christian. Armed conflict between Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Army has made life in the area difficult. This was exacerbated in 2011 with the end of a cease fire that left over 100,000 people internally displaced. In the camp where many of these people live there is little opportunity to earn a living. The government have made it worse by blocking aid to displaced people. This has led to women and girls becoming particularly vulnerable to trafficking as they search for jobs outside the country, often in China.  Bennu was living in a Kachin refugee camp when she was trafficked to China and forced to have a sexual relationship with a Chinese man. She was also forced to do all the housework. Bennu was able to escape with the help of a fellow Kachin man."

I lived in a place called the building where I served drinks for the first week. I didn’t know. I thought I had a job to help my family. But the other girls told me things. Later, the pimp sold my virginity for $300. I lost my choice. I lost my voice. I lost myself. I was worth nothing to them but money. Some nights I was sent out with one or two customers. Some nights he kept me in where I saw 10, 20 customers. When I didn’t want to have sex, they beat me. Sometimes they electrocuted me. I could’ve run but I was afraid and my mother had made a contract. I’m a good daughter, I do not want to hurt my mother. Then there was a man. A foreigner, he took me in his car to the forest. He was drunk, and he did things to me that hurt badly. Then one night I was taken to a hotel to see another customer, but it was the police and a non-governmental organization. I was very afraid, I thought they would make me work more. But instead they took me to a shelter. I was safe. I could not leave, but no one could hurt me there. And then I found out I have HIV. One of the men, he give it to me. For many, especially in Cambodia, HIV means death. But for me, I’m lucky. At the centre, I have a second father and a second mother. James, he makes sure I have healthcare and antiretroviral drugs. He gave me a chance at life. Sya, she held my hand and showed me how to live again. She took me to the pagoda and told me the stories of Buddha. She told me the stories of Pulpoth and the Khmer Rouge. When she worked the rice fields for 18 hours every day and many died. She showed me how to forgive, and how to love. First myself, and then others. I live with other girls who have stories just like me. I know the other girls are afraid. They’re angry. I know that they feel there is only one thins left for them. And I know, late at night, they hurt just like I did. But like TCI gave to me, so will I give back to them. I want to help the others, to prospect them, from the pimps and the brothels. I am Srey Neth. I am a survivor. It has been 5 years, but I have found my home, I have found my voice and I am finding myself.   Original Narrative can be found here    "," There are an estimated 261,000 people living in modern slavery in Cambodia (GSI 2018). The country was renowned as a sex tourism destination in the 1990s and this legacy is still prevalent today with women and girls trafficked within the thriving sex industry in Cambodia's major cities. Despite significant attempts to curb CSE, NGOs report the industry has been pushed underground and sex offenders are still able to purchase sex with children through an intermediary rather than more overt selling of sex in brothels. Boys and young men are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation, with many entering the massage industry due to a lack of training and skills.  Srey Neth is a young Cambodian victim of human trafficking. In this story she speaks of her experience transitioning from victim to survivor. At 14 she was sold by her mother to a pimp for $300; a week later he sold her virginity for the same price then he forced her to serve 10-20 men per night afterwards. Her refusal was met with beatings or electrocution. Srey Neth was later rescued by police and a non-governmental organization. During her recovery, which unsurprisingly has taken more than five years, she was diagnosed with HIV."

I have five sisters and two brothers. I’m number five. My parents are farmers. I migrated to the US because of too much poverty in the Philippines and no employment. Also, I wanted to come here because I’m a survivor of domestic violence with my ex-husband. There were lots of times he hit me, punched me, slapped me, kicked me… he choked me. My name is Jauna Dwyer, I’m a domestic worker. In 1985 before the gulf war, I went to Kuwait. I worked as what is called a DH (domestic help) which is a kind of domestic work. No day off. Seven days a week. You just say you’re working 16 hours a day. Every time... when my employer would go out of the house, she would lock me inside the house. She would also lock up the telephone so I could not communicate with anyone. Her sister would slap me hard. The sister of my ex-husband helped bring me over to the United States. The separation from my family and my kids was hard. I want to be punctual. For me, domestic work is hard. I have already scoliosis and I’ve had knee surgery. I like it and I am earning money so I can send to college my kids back in the Philippines and I can support them. In 2009 I worked in Manhattan as a baby sitter. I worked with them for 18 months. We had an agreement that I’m entitled to get two weeks vacation, paid vacation in one year pf my work. I give them notice three month before I took the vacation and then with the time I went to vacation they did not give me my vacation pay. And er I felt embarrassed asking in person so I we asked when I get the vacation pay, they said ‘you’re the one who wants vacation’ and you’re not entitled to get vacation pay. I just received a text message that I was fired. And I asked them if they can give me like a separation pay or you know or erm reference but they said because of the circumstances you are not entitled to get severance pay. At the time I was already a member of the Damayan Migrant Workers. Damayan called me and they told me that I’m entitled to get my overtime and severance. So at the same time we claimed unemployment but my employer contest. I won my unpaid wages or ‘theft wages’. Damayan is a grassroots organisation they help abused Filipino workers, especially labor trafficked workers. […] My hope for the community for the future is that we will get justice for all workers, domestic workers. They will get justice! In Damayan I work as Deputy Chair.

Esther Caukill,2016 (Narrative date),Sexual exploitation Narrative,"",Japan (slavery location),"My name is Esther. When I was 19, I was trafficked. As a child I was brought up in a really very poor family, sometimes we go to bed hungry. My dad molested me and I was so scared I couldn’t tell anyone. I didn’t want to stain his reputation because he was a deacon in our church, and I thought how could this person be holy at church and then at home he was a monster? At a young age I told myself that I have to get educated and help and get out of poverty and help my siblings. I applied to work as a singer in Japan, but on the day of our departure they gave me a fake passport and we were instructed that if we say something or tell anyone about their operation, they’re going to kill my family. When we reached to our destination, I was brought to the mafia boss and I was raped. I think they probably tried to ‘test the goods’ that they bought. I was put in a karaoke club and we were forced to go out to the clients and because I didn’t want to, they would just slap me and kick me until I had to go with a client. And all I could do was cry every night and try to plan a way out. Eventually we were able to escape, and I was hiding away from Yakuza, which was the Japanese mafia. Years later, I was fortunate that I was able to come to Australia, I became an accountant and one day one of my clients, I used to go to their home office, I found that they were loving, kind and I found that they were Christian. And I asked if I could do some bible studies with them. Although I had done a lot of self-help before, I just kept going back to my way of thinking and feel of enslavement. It’s only with God I’ve found that inner peace and total freedom. I wish that you can find that too.   Narrative provided by ARtv"," It is estimated that an estimated 37,000 people are living in modern slavery in Japan (GSI 2018).

Marlene,2013 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation Narrative,United States (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),"I am a survivor of human trafficking. I was taken when I was 15 years old and put into prostitution. And so, many many years, now as I am much older, I want to go back and help girls that I knew were being victim to this issue. There was a couple that moved in to my neighbourhood. Their house was the safe house, the hangout house. And they asked four girls including myself to ask our parents to go to New York City. We thought we were going to go shopping and see a Broadway show. And it ended up we were sold into prostitution. We came back to Columbus, Ohio and we’re thinking the nightmare was over, we would be fine, we just gotta get through what just happened. Two weeks later I was walking to school and I seen his car pull up, and as I started to run he told me to get in the car and when I didn’t his brother snatched me and threw me in the car and that’s when they kept me for eight months. And so, we went around the country in prostitution and that time. […] Our restaurant is kind of a front for helping girls. Because while a pimp won’t let you go to counselling centre or to go and get help, but they’ll let you eat. So, if you can get in the door of the restaurant, we can get you some services and support that you need. There’s a lot being done politically. There’s a lot being done as far as education and awareness, things like that. What’s not being done is on the streets at the grassroots, where the victims are. There are 15-year-old girls that are prostituted right outside this door. Matter of fact one that stands on the next corner from here. So, when I see that, I don’t care what the politicians are doing. You know I’m just being honest, I don’t care about that. I need someone to help that girl that’s on that corner and get her away from the pimp that’s on the next corner watching her. There’s a world that happens after 10 o clock at night in Columbus, Ohio that most people don’t even know exists. And so that is the biggest weapon against us, is our ignorance. […] The tri-state of human trafficking is like a teenage girl being raped over and over and over again. No one wants that to happen. I wouldn’t thought in a million years that I would be helping victims of human trafficking first of all, but the pain that I’ve gone through over this issue has totally made me into who I am today. And I will never stop doing this work, I know that. There was a poem that I had written oh my gosh I was probably 12 years old, and I literally would recite this poem during the roughest times of this whole thing and it just gave me a lot of hope. Remember the promises of God, for they are more precious than fine stone And they will be there to comfort you when you’re down and all alone When it seems like your fault on every hand Always remember his word, on that you can stand God’s word is faithful and God’s word is true Whatever he says, that’s just what he’ll do Stay Strong.     Original Narrative can be found here"," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Leah Albright-Byrd ,2014 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation Narrative,United States (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),"Mom was gonna abort before I was even here. Seems like an effort was made to get rid of me. And I started running away from home, and I just didn’t feel wanted and just had this big gaping hole in my heart for attention for people to love me, care about me. So I ended up running away for the final time when I was 14. Around that time I had me a drug dealer in Sacramento and he said well you can come live with me. Moved in with him and he said you know, as long as I was going to school he would take care of me and keep a roof over my head. When he saw that I was cutting class he said well if you’re not gonna go to school you need to contribute to this household. And he said you can either sell drugs or you can sell yourself. And he hooked us up with a pimp who is still at large, still pimping in this community. And I ended up on Stockard Boulevard here in Sacramento. 4 years, out there 4 nearly for years and it was the absolute worst experiences that any young woman could have. You know, one nightmare after another. After that initial when I was first exploited, there was something that just kind of died, there’s just something that dies in you. There’s nothing like feeling you’re at the mercy of someone else, and they feel like they can do whatever they want to do to you and you can’t fight back. My journal entries around that time I had written in my journal, either something’s going to change in my life or I’m going to die. When I was 18, I started going to Sac City college, and I had five classes, and of those five classes I had four with the same girl. Pentecostal girl named Diana Hurn. She says when she first saw me she thought I wonder does she know Jesus? And one day you know I was breaking down on campus because I was so emotional, I was just overwhelmed because I was still in the life and trying to get out. And I ran into her and she said she would talk to me. We went to the library and, I didn’t tell her everything because I was afraid she was gonna judge me. She was like ‘oh you should come to church with me this Sunday, you know my dad’s a minister you should come’. I was like, ok, so I went, I met her that Sunday and we got in her car and we’re driving down the road. It’s a beautiful sunny day. And that was my time you know, that was the time I believed God had been waiting for, you know, to just set me free from stuff I’d been dealing with. And we went to service that day and I don’t remember anything the Pastor said. But I so remember him saying you should come up for prayer. And I was like, no I’m not getting up in front of all these people, but he kept saying we’re not here to hurt you we’re here to help you. And I went up there and he put the microphone to one side, and he proceeded to tell me things that I knew only God could’ve shown him because I didn’t tell these people, I didn’t know these people, I didn’t tell them I was struggling with nightmares, I didn’t tell them, you know some of the intimate details of my family. And it was just like God gave him insight into who I was and where I was. You know, and I literally had a Sol on the road to Damascus conversion because I went from a being totally disinterested in the things of God, to wow God’s been wooing me this whole time, he’s been coming after me this whole time. And I just went from one extreme to the other. And I’ll forever be grateful for miss Diana. That she really believed in me. She believed in me and she was the one who would speak things over with me. And I remember one day were were sitting in her room, she asked me if I was gonna die tomorrow where would I go? And I was so just broken on the inside I didn’t believe that God would love me and that he would give me the opportunity to you know, to go to heaven. And she looked at me and she said you are right now, seated with Christ in heavenly places. [crying] And it changed my life. It gave me hope. That I could be loved by people. Only God can transform your life and leave no trace of who you were. And er I always, you know always say I am Bridget’s Dream because I am free from sex slavery and sex trafficking, I am the dream, I’ve become the thing that I think, I know God wants to do in the lives of other young ladies. I’ve had these moments, I just thought about this, I’ve had these moments in my walk with God, I’ve never heard him speak to me audibly but I’ve heard him really really clearing my spirit. I was mad with God and I was having one of those angry conversations with God in 2007 driving on the freeway. Why have I had to hurt so much? You know and I felt the Holy Spirit say to me it’s because I’m sending you to a hurting generation, you know. And I’m looking at all the girls that I’ve known over the years and since I’ve been you know full time fighting sex trafficking. We all come from such brokenness. So, when I sit with a young lady, or I meet a young lady at juvenile hall or sit with them on the streets or I sit with families and I talk to mother sin my communities and they’re dealing with the exploitation of their daughters and they see her and they don’t recognise who she is. I can tell them from a place of being an overcomer. Not just having survived what I’ve survived but thriving in that survival. I’ll never be who I could’ve been if I hadn’t been traumatised. And I don’t think I wanna be who I could’ve been if I hadn’t been traumatised. Because its my trauma that’s given my heart for girls who go through the same thing.   Narrative provided by Better Together Tour      "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Noel Gomez ,2015 (Narrative date),Children Sexual exploitation Narrative,United States (trafficked from) Sexual exploitation,United States (slavery location),"So first of all, domestic sex trafficking is a huge issue here in the United States. It is happening every day. It doesn’t stop. I meet with girls every day who have been through this or are going through this. My experience was, I was young, and this is the common experience, is that, you know, the girls are very vulnerable women, they get caught up in this kind of life. And I was very young, I came from some violent kind of background. I got pregnant at a young age, you know, in this, and this goes back to some of the trauma that I dealt with as a kid as well. I got pregnant at a young age, 15, anf when I got pregnant, my family told met that I had to leave. So, I left home and was pregnant, and I ended up just staying with friends until I was able to have the baby. And I had my son and he went with his father’s family because, you know, I didn’t have any stable place to take him or you know, or to be a mother. So I was pretty much just left out in the world, you know, at a very young age, just lost my son, you know, didn’t have family, was just really scared our here and didn’t know what I was going to do. And I want to say that the pimps and predators look for, I was a perfect victim for a predator, an exploiter, whatever you want to call it. So, I met him and I thought he was really great, he had a car and had jewellery and he had nice clothes and he smelled good. He looked good and he knew all the right things to say and, you know, he figured out what I was lacking which was a father, love, you know, family, money, a place to stay. All of those things. And you know, he capitalized off my vulnerability. Eventually I was taken to Hollywood and this is around the Pretty Woman time, I guess. Alright, yeah, I was taken to Hollywood with him and he had you know got me all excited about going on this trip, and we’re going to Hollywood. And you know, I was young and I was like, I’m gonna get discovered and you know, media and movies made it kind of seem that way back then. And actually, I was made to work out on the streets once we got there and you know, I was in fear for my life. I feared for everything, you know, he threatened my son, threatened to you know everything. And I believed his threats because he was already pretty violent with me. Now, why didn’t I walk away from that violence in the beginning? Well, because I came from that and that is what I was used to and that to me meant that he loved me. And it meant that he loved me enough to care that much, to get that upset. I mean, you know, it’s not much different than domestic violence in that way. So, anyway, I ended up being in that life for a very long time, unable to escape from him. I tried a number of times. One time he found me, handcuffed me, locked me in a trunk, drove me to another state, you know, just constantly threatened my child, threatened that he knew where he lived, that he would kill him. It was you know, beat me to the point where I had to have cat scans on my brain to see if I had blood clots. I mean just terror, total terror. And back then, there was nowhere to go. So that’s pretty much what happened. […] So, I met him not too long after I had my son, maybe six months, seven months. You know, it takes months of grooming, there’s a grooming process that they go through with the girls. And then you wanted to know how I got out? Okay, so anyway I ended up getting away from him after a number of years, and you know I really think I was, I was also getting too old for him. I was getting in to my mid-0s and he couldn’t control me as easily because I was starting to become more, I was just getting older. So, I go away from him. Now, leaving him and having no resources, nobody to go to for help at all. For people who are domestically trafficked and there’s nothing, there’s no support as far as college housing, anything at that time, you know. I had to, you know, I ended up staying in that life for 15 years because I was so beat up and my self-esteem was so, it was gone. I didn’t have one, I had no love for myself at all. You know, I didn’t think anybody would every hire me for a job, I didn’t know how to get a job. I didn’t know how to do all the things that I should have been taught and I didn’t have anybody to teach me and I was too ashamed to ask anybody to teach me. So, I didn’t, I just thought that that was the life that was meant for me. [What stopped you from just giving up?] My son, I had a son, you know, so my biggest, well that’s probably it. Because I don’t think I’d be alive if I didn’t have… my biggest fear was that I was gonna get murdered and thrown in a ditch, which did come close to happening a few times, and just be, back then it’s just another dead prostitute, and that would be the only thing my son knew about me. And that really scared me. I had hope that someday I would be able to be a different role model for him. [How did you get from where you were to now?] It been crazy. You know, well getting out of that life is the most terrifying and scary experience ever because, you know, you live in a different world really from the rest of society. So, it was like, I would see these regular people or whatever, we thought they were normal, but now that I’m in this world too, I realised that they’re not normal either. You know, I never thought that I could be one of those people, I never thought that I would like jogging or something and before work, or doing things like that, you know. We lived in a totally different world so trying to adapt and learn how to be in this world is really hard work, really hard work. So, the first thing I did when I decided to get out, and this was a very hard decision, but I sold everything that I had and moved into this tiny little apartment and I got a job at a restaurant. I’d never had a job, my first job at a restaurant which actually, for me it was a pretty good transition because I was getting cash tips every night, you know. So, it was a good kind of transition to the new life. And I started going to school and I ended up getting a degree and I became a chemical dependency counsellor. I went in to chemical dependency and started working with youth down in the detention centre here in Seattle. And I was doing these, like our assessments with these young girls, you know, 14,15,16-year-olds, and I started listening to them and realizing they were using language that I was very familiar with. They were talking about things that probably somebody else would not have picked up on. They were there for like theft charges or other things, but I realized that these girls were all being exploited. They were being prostituted. And I couldn’t believe the number of girls that I was meeting with and the story was the same. So, I started looking around and saying who does this job, whose job is this? You know, to help these girls. Because this is, we gotta help, these girls are being pimped. There was no job to help them, there was just no job existed. So anyway, that was very frustrating, and I just became, you know, I was also doing the city of Seattle’s diversion class for women 18 and over, who were arrested for prostitution who would come into this diversion program. And I was talking to these women and it was the same story with them. It was like, where do we go for support? We’ve never been somewhere like this, we’ve never been around other survivors who you can talk about this stuff to. They were so relieved when they came and realized that I had also been there, and that I wasn’t going to just lecture them and tell them about stuff I read in books, right. We needed more of that in Seattle because we had none of it. So, I was waiting for somebody to do it, but nobody did it. So, then we did it. We started up and we started with support groups in the community, you know, no funding, no anything. We just started doing it. It was running support groups in Seattle for specifically these women and girls and doing art workshops. We believe that art is a great way to just kind of escape and maybe feel like a kid and just forget all that stuff for a little while. And so, we started with that and we’re just hoping to grow and grow so we can help more women. We definitely have way over the amount of women than we have employees, but now, yeah we do drop in twice a week. So, dinner twice a week. We have Saturday art workshops, we have support groups three times a week. You know, we work one-on-one with women, peer mentorship. And my goal is to train women who are getting out of the life to, you know, become leaders and be able to do this work as well. And it’s happening. We have, one of the things that’s really important to us is having stipends for survivors. We always want survivors at every drop-in we do. Anybody from OPS who’s going to be a leader in any situation is gonna be a survivor. There’re always survivors, and yes, they’re all women who came through OPS. One of the women who came through OPS came to one of our very first support groups and she’s now on our board, she does public speaking, she’s amazing, and she’s getting her bachelor’s degree, applying to get into a PhD program. I mean, amazing things are happening. […] When I was working on the streets, the women were arrested and the men were let go with just like ‘hey buddy get out of here’, you know ‘don’t come back today’, you know? That kind of thing, right? Which I always would stand there in my handcuffs wondering why I was the criminal, you know? So that change is huge, I mean huge huge huge. That men are actually being arrested for committing this crime. That’s insanely huge. I mean we celebrate this day, because it really starts with the buyers. I mean the buyers have problems too, obviously, otherwise they wouldn’t be out there doing that. So, we need to arrest them and then give them services and that is something that we do, we do a 10-week program that the men have to go to after they’re arrested. That’s where they get counselling and also, they get to understand why this happens, why they’re doing it. So that’s really important. And then I’ll say this on the buyer, it’s called Buyer Beware, so on the stings, so when they go out and they arrest, they don’t take the women to jail but when they do a sting, they’ll have me there and then maybe a couple of other advocates from Seattle there, and bring the women in and we have good and we have stuff to drink and everything. And they come, it’s all women, and we just sit down and talk to them, find out if they need resources, find out if there’s anything we can do to help them out, you know. Make sure they know that they’re loved, and they’re cared about and they’re just as important as everybody else. And they call and you know, if we get three people out of that whole sting operation that want to make a change and want these resources, that is success. [What is something that you want to tell Americans about sex trafficking in the US?] Well I would like to say that you know, a lot of people I think just feel like they go day to day and all they can do is just get through work and get through their response, you know, whatever they need to do for themselves, and they kind of sometimes want to ignore what is happening and I just want people to really really know that this has been happening for a really long time here. And women and girls are being terrorized in this country right now by exploiters and predators and young boys, and I think it’s time that we really pay attention to what is happening to our people here, right now. With this issue I think everybody in every country is really important, but I think that the women from the United States are really really really important too, and I would like to see more funding going into domestic trafficking and more awareness around domestic trafficking. Because it can be your daughter, it can be your niece, it can be anybody, and it’s an epidemic. It completely is. I mean, I work with the young people, you know, they listen to the music and it’s all about money, you know what I mean? We have a major problem. […] Wherever you live, there’s organizations now in every state, you can find an organization specifically with this population. There’re different agencies but you want to find one that works specifically with this population. Just ask them what you can do, if you can volunteer, I don’t know, bring meals sometimes. I mean, there’s just little tiny things that you can do to help so much. You know, we love it when we get a donation of like gift bags, hygiene bags that we can go out and hand out, you know. I mean, that means the world so just somebody who’s out there, you know, they get a toothbrush, toothpaste, all of those things. Start thinking about how boys are learning about women and sex and they’re learning from porn and that’s not real, that’s not how women are, right? I mean, we need to start educating our boys about sex and our girls about you know, all of this trafficking and all of this materialistic society that we’re living in now, and how life is not worth it, because you pay dearly with your soul, you know. It might not seem like it at the time because you’re here in the middle of it, but when you get, one day, it’s gonna catch up to you, and then you’re gonna have to deal with PTSD, depression, anxiety, all of the things. If you’re alive, you’re alive. So, you know, we need to be educating at a younger age, we need to be talking to boys about sex at a younger age. We need to be talking about what it means to be a man at a younger age and stop that conditioning of saying boys don’t cry, you got to be strong, you got to do this, you’ve got to do that. In middle school, how many girls who sleep with you know. No. You know, we’ve got that pressure is on the boys too, when they’re you know. And I’m not excusing the behaviour of going out and thinking you have the right to buy another human being. I’m not excusing that. But we’ve got to deal with the issue, you know. For any movement to really happen and any change.   Narrative provided by Public Radio International "," There are an estimated 403,000 people living in modern slavery in the United States (GSI 2018).

Yonas,2014 (Narrative date),Trafficking Narrative,Sudan (slavery location) Egypt (slavery location),Eritrea (trafficked from),"The first group of kidnappers said I had to pay $3,500. They blindfolded all of us and chained our hands and legs together. They threatened to remove our organs if we didn’t pay. Even though my family paid, they didn’t release me but instead sold me to a second group. The second kidnappers said we had to pay them $33,000 because they had bought us from the first group, so we had to help them get their money back. They beat me with a metal rod. They dripped molten plastic onto my back. They beat the soles of my feet and then they forced me to stand for long periods of time, sometimes for days. Sometimes they threatened to kill me and put a gun to my head. They hung me from the ceiling so my legs couldn’t reach the floor and they gave me electric shocks. One person died after they hung him from the ceiling for 24 hours. We watched him die. Whenever I called my relatives to ask them to pay, they burnt me with a hot iron rod so I would scream on the phone. We could not protect the women in our room: they just took them out, raped them, and brought them back. They hardly let us sleep and I thought I was going to die but in the end a group of us managed to escape.  *name given Narrative provided by Human Rights Watch in their report “I Wanted to Lie Down and Die”: Trafficking and Torture of Eritreans in Sudan and Egypt"," There are an estimated 518,000 people living in modern slavery in Egypt, 465,000 in Sudan and an estimated 451,000 in Eritrea (GSI 2018).
